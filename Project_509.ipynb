We had their Japachae which is a glass noodle, Bimbimbap, House Fried Rice, Korean Tacos with Bulgogi, and their Yummiest Fried chicken. We always get the \"LARGE Combo Fried Chicken\" (Wings and Drumsticks ) The  first time we went we  tried their Fried chicken with the flavor Soy Garlic. The second time we came we tried the Half and Half Fried chicken, half Soy  Garlic and half Spicy. I'm glad that we can do Half and Half of the Flavors.  This place looks small from the outside, but inside it has a nice set up, it looks spacious.  Also the best thing here is the Service, omg the workers here move so Fast, I envy their Energy.

Its an order at the counter take it to go kind of place, but they do have tables outside. Seating is very limited so you probably wont grab a seat when its crowded. There are also a ton of flies around, so its not super pleasant. The food was amazing despite taking 45 minutes for it to be prepared. At least you know its fresh. We ordered the Pad See Ew, panang curry, and lahb salad. The pad see ew had great flavor and wasnt overly spicy. My only complaint is that not all the noodles had been stir fried properly with flavor so some of the noodles were a little light in color. The panang curry was a generous portion and was thick and creamy. They also offer brown rice free of an extra charge! The lahb salad was probably the most disappointing for me personally. Maybe its because i didnt like the flavor combinations as much, so ill definitely go for the papaya salad next t...</td>\n",

Pad Thai is delicious and my bf's favorite dish. Great flavors and a classic dish for people who typically order this at a Thai restaurant.Mango sticky rice. Is.The.Best!

       "835  Its not every day you run into a place that has great thai food at reasonable prices, so this place gets 5 stars. Its an order at the counter take it to go kind of place, but they do have tables outside. Seating is very limited so you probably wont grab a seat when its crowded. There are also a ton of flies around, so its not super pleasant. The food was amazing despite taking 45 minutes for it to be prepared. At least you know its fresh. We ordered the Pad See Ew, panang curry, and lahb salad. The pad see ew had great flavor and wasnt overly spicy. My only complaint is that not all the noodles had been stir fried properly with flavor so some of the noodles were a little light in color. The panang curry was a generous portion and was thick and creamy. They also offer brown rice free of an extra charge! The lahb salad was probably the most disappointing for me personally. Maybe its because i didnt like the flavor combinations as much, so ill definitely go for the papaya salad next t...  \n",

Got the beef drunken noodles. Everything was great but the beef. It was chewy and it wasn't fresh. That being said, it hit the spot for satisfying my crave for noodles, and flavor, and spice. I'd come back but skip on the meet.  \n",

This place has always been my go-to #1 spot for Thai food. Their pad see ew is delicious!! Flavors are great, cooked really well (usually has that deep dark brown coloring and slight char) . Juicy beef ! I got Hot and it wasn't hot to me at all :)! I typically love spicy food! Pad Thai is delicious and my bf's favorite dish. Great flavors and a classic dish for people who typically order this at a Thai restaurant.Mango sticky rice. Is.The.Best! Highly recommend this as well as their Thai tea!! We also go their chicken satay. Peanut sauce is so good!! And the chicken itself is JUICY!!! Highly recommend coming here!! There's only street parking so parking could be tough :/ but flavors are BOMB!!!! Soooo freakn good!  \n",

Seriously. It's gotta have crack in it, you'll be spending more of your budget than you mean to on it, and you'll end up just like me.Okay but on a serious note, every time I come here they NAIL their chicken pad Thai. Only complaint is it's hard to try anything else when it's so good!  \n",
