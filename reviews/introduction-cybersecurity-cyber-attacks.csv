2019-09-05,Justin G,1.0,138.0,"This is bad.

This is objectively bad.

The quality of the slides? Bad. The audio quality of the presenters? Bad. The presentation itself? Bad.

Bad. All. Around. I expected a LOT more from IBM. 

If you're going to build a course in English.. use primary English speakers. 
If you're going to build a MOOC module? Build it. Don't slap prerecorded training from internal crap into a module and push it out.
The speakers gender has absolutely nothing to do with this course, nor should it hold any weight or impact. Knocking and police sirens? Really??

No. Just no."
2019-10-01,Ian L,1.0,103.0,"I have been stymied by the poor quality of the course material and the lack of proof-reading that has gone into compiling these quizzes. I don’t mind the occasional typo that gets through (those happen) but when I have to select THE WRONG ANSWER in order to get credit/point for the question, that is a problem (Please see Week 3, Practice Quiz: Incident Response). I am unable to see feedback on failed quizzes in order to find out what I missed (Please see final quiz in Week 2 – Many people in the thread have also struggled with it as well). I have no faith in the organizers of this course for the following reasons: (1) poor audio quality that is unintelligible in parts, to the point that even the transcript underneath the video says “[INAUDIBLE]” at times, (2) the lack of instruction on all topics while still giving us questions in the quizzes that ask about concepts that we didn’t cover, (3) the obvious lack of proof-reading where the right answer is wrong and the wrong answer is right. I am disappointed because this is not the standard I am use to with Coursera. The Google IT Support certification was of excellent quality and well executed. It was a challenge but it was passable. This IBM badge however has been a nightmare. I would strongly advise that someone at Coursera Support reads the threads and discussion forums.   "
2020-01-03,Prateek S,2.0,45.0,"I would like to demonstrate the course in both the ways, it's up to you wanna learn from IBM or not. 
This course is very informative for me (cause I've zero knowledge about it!) that's why it was informative for me. The resources they are providing is very good. Here you will interact with some new terminology which is very rare to find in any blogs or any other platforms over the internet. So this is the good side of the course.
Now I would like to honest with you guys, this course is not properly maintained. It seems like somebody in a hurry collects all the materials and just puts it through in order to do the formality. The audio quality was very poor, so we have to depend either on subtitles or any DJ speakers (Yes, I'm not kidding. I'm serious). Apart from that transcriber itself couldn't able to do the correct subtitles because of poor audio quality. On Assignment 1 & 3, they have some type of grading problem, and also feedback for that is not available. There is also no mentor interaction, they just made video lectures and uploads on Coursera, that's it. Well, in most of the discussion forums, I've solved the doubts of most of the problems of students.
Now, the question arises, why the hell in Universe I dared to complete the course. Its because people haven't reviewed it in a very proper manner. In the very beginning, it was all perfect, but after the last video lecture of module 1, the main game starts. Sometimes I decided to quit, but my colleagues, who are also studying with me, and actively participate in discussion forums, advised me to complete the course. It really motivates me and pushed me to complete the course.
Well, are you going to the specialization? The answer is yes. I'm going forward to the specialization.
I hope, this review will really help you out. 
Thanks and Cheers!"
2020-02-05,Matthew F,1.0,42.0,"Terrible sound quality, muffled descriptions, some lectures recorded in someone's bedroom (it seems) with the neighbours banging on the door in the background, plus the quizzes do not tell you what you got wrong (like all the other courses Ive done). A very dry topic but no effort has gone into making this course interesting. "
2019-10-31,Amrit S S,1.0,38.0,"Horrible course. Bad instructors, terrible audio and visualization. IBM could have done much better. Shame on you."
2020-02-08,Chantal L,2.0,26.0,"This course was very hastily put together. Two of the speakers were difficult to understand. One repeated himself so often that after a couple of videos I started to loose my enthusiasm. The speaker knew his material and had a nice friendly voice but he lacked specific vocabulary and consequently in a many places the ideas he was discussing got lost. Lacking essential vocabulary, he kept going back and changing words, confusing the issue. His explanations were difficult to listen to and read.. To make matters worse. In several instances, the accompanying transcripts of videos didn't match what was said,  and could have been edited to clarify what the speaker was trying to communicate, but were delivered nonetheless. I had to transcribe every video which was both tedious and frustrating. Some videos text was too fuzzy to read.  Lastly, every video began with the same static graphic of the hacker was uninteresting and boring. Overall, this course lacks development and polish.  IBM is capable of better! "
2020-12-25,Ritika V,5.0,24.0,If you want to learn cybersecurity and you have no idea about that. Then this is the best course which covers all the basic topics and provide you a best knowledge about cybersecurity and their tools.
2020-08-15,Aditya G,5.0,22.0,The reading link to Week 03's Framework and their purpose is Broken. Please Fix it. Everything else seemed perfect. I would recommend this course for people who think of starting their careers in CyS.
2020-02-19,Patrick R,1.0,22.0,"This course was rather painful to go through for multiple reasons. Main reason is the poor quality of audio and the slides. Additionally the presentation skills of the preseters was subpar, especially when it comes to proper command of English. The topics were kind of thrown together. Personally if I were IBM I would not put this out. IBM can do much better as evidenced for example by the Data Science courses, which are highly professional."
2019-11-07,sadra z,5.0,19.0,"I appreciate the chance to learn fundamentals of cyber security with you.
The vast number of topics made it pretty interesting for me and I couldn't wait to learn more.

2020-02-07,KASHISH J,5.0,17.0,"it was a great experience learning so many basic concepts about the cybersecurity world , helped in understanding the key terms of cybersecurity and makes me stand out in cybersecurity crowd."
2019-09-02,Renaud L,3.0,17.0,"Heavy emphasis on videos and, sadly, they are not well structured. The teaching staff is made up of employees that do not master English and it makes the learning experience somewhat painful. They speak in incomplete sentences, overly using words such as ""so"", ""someone"", ""somebody"", and peppered with filler words.Also, the transcripts, which could be an alternative, are just horrible. I suggest using well-made PDFs, using the same presentation slides but with clear text explanations."
2020-04-18,Modestas G,5.0,16.0,"Very solid course. Quick overview about almost everything you need to know at the beginning. A lot of useful links with additional material to study. Thanks a lot for sharing the knowledge, indeed!"
2019-09-02,Syed H A,4.0,16.0,"Audio quality can be a little better. Some topics are quite interesting though there's no reading material provided for them. The ones provided are excellent materials, no doubt. But, reading material on cryptography, encryption, DES, AES, that would've been excellent!"
2020-05-26,Domantas Š,1.0,16.0,"To put it bluntly, the course is made very poorly.
Persistent poor quality videos that looked like they were cut up and stitched together, nitpicky quizzes that don't really test how well you understood the material but how blankly you memorized it.
Starting the course I was expecting a lot, but by the end of the first course, I'm planning on dropping it."
2020-04-15,De L P G d C,1.0,13.0,"Some of the Teachers has terrible didactics, sometimes it looks like they are stutterers, sometimes the video has bad noises or the quality of microphone is bad (too slow or broken), some of the slides are badly drawn. I was expecting too much from this course."

2022-04-27,Danquez R,5.0,11.0,Best tip for these courses get a notebook and write down the question thats put at the beginning of each video then answer it by the end if you do this you will have no problem completing any course!
2022-04-24,Boluwaji J,5.0,11.0,"An introduction for a beginner that takes you through the steps, very informative, and helpful to guide you through the basics and move on towards advance level. I definitely recomend, Thank you IBM."
2020-06-26,Bhumika R,1.0,10.0,"The audio in most videos is not clear. Besides, constant variation in sound and speaking style is not conducive for a good learning experience. Did not understand the voice in a few videos"
2019-11-25,Oludemi-Adelaiye D,5.0,9.0,This is my first course and I really enjoyed it. It's built on practical knowledge and has really inspired me to learn more about Cyber Security.
2019-09-02,Marty A,2.0,9.0,"Very heavy on videos, though the audio quality and transcripts could be better. The quizzes could also be improved, as they are too  focused on memorization of trivia -- a bit more engagement of critical thinking skills would do. I also thought the little story about Ronald Regan and ""War Games"" was silly...surely the U.S. government became concerned about cybersecurity in the 80s due to the rise of the PC? At very least, the course points you in the right direction for other industry resources; in addition, it's part of a 4 part program, so you need it, even if it is not the best or most exciting."
2022-06-01,Edwin Z T,5.0,8.0,"Instructive and educational. Great and fulfilling course on Cybersecurity Tools and Cyber Attacks! 

Awesome course fullfils its objectives of providing the needed tools amd skills in Cyber attacks."
2019-10-20,Jon J ,3.0,8.0,Content was good but the delivery was poor. Would prefer instructors who are native English speakers as it was very difficult to understand portions of the content. Don't see why they couldn't facilitate that given all the instructors are doing is narrating. 
2019-10-06 00:00:00,Lakshay P,5.0,7.0,"course is good but the problem occurs because of asginment, because there is many right answer in option so student get confuse and sometimes wrong answers are right."

2020-05-28 00:00:00,Gaurav R,1.0,6.0,The audio quality in classes are very poor . The Instructors fumbles a lot while speaking .
2021-07-18 00:00:00,kouser z d,1.0,4.0,"I was quite sad and upset in this course, it was really a Project Management Course NOT a cyber security course. The first three modules were mostly repeats of the same subject matters. Only in the final module 4 did they actually cover anything relevant to cyber security, and it was simply too short. As stated earlier this was all definitions and Project Management concepts as oppose to actually learning anything about cyber security.

The quality of audio from some of the authors was very poor quality. If English is not your first language I would say not to do this as you will not be able to understand the authors, as the sound quality is very poor in understanding what they are saying.

I did not learn much from this in terms of actual cyber security, just a few things towards the end, as I say I had high hopes from this considering its IBM and was very sad at the product quality itself."
2020-07-08 00:00:00,Thomas S,1.0,4.0,All presenters had issues with background noise and white noise.  Sometimes presenters speech was muffled or had wild swings in volume.  The presentation was extremely basic and boring.  
2020-07-04 00:00:00,Partha S,1.0,4.0,"Very difficult to follow due to poor audio quality. The course is anything but interactive, nothing more than poorly recorded PowerPoint presentation. I expect better from IBM."

2021-08-18 00:00:00,Eric R,1.0,2.0,"I am taking this course because it's an IBM Professional Certificate Course. Right now I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of the videos. I expected more than what I've been presented by a multinational corporation like IBM. I can live with the poor video quality because the real issue is the quality of the speakers used to teach each lesson. I'm sure they are brilliant in their respective fields, but as speakers they are extremely poor. In one video which sounds like the lecturer is in a tunnel someone keeps knocking on the door in the background. It didn't happen once but twice in two separate lectures. A couple of the lecturers  have not prepared for their topic. They stumble over words, lose their place, go off topic. Right now I'm at week two listening to ""Cyber Kill Chain"". I can barely understand the lecturer, his English is virtually unintelligible. This is ridiculous and I can't understand how something this sloppy was allowed to be posted and charged money for. I'm extremely annoyed because I'd like to learn. I don't mind the subject matter being hard but trying to follow an unprepared or non-English speaking lecturer is unacceptable... "
2020-10-08 00:00:00,Michael S,1.0,2.0,"I've nearly completed only week 2 but feel compelled to provide feedback now.

So far, the material is too generalised and vague and poorly written.
On top of that, I can't understand what some of the presenters are saying.
In addition, it's even difficult at times to make sense of the transcript.

I work for IBM. 
I know we have loads of clever people in this company.
I'm sure we can do better than this.

Very disappointed.

Update : I have now finished the course.
It didn't improve.
Total waste of time."
2022-05-02 00:00:00,Alan O,1.0,2.0,E​xtremely poor quality video and audio. Very surpised at IBM for delivering such poor qaulity content and also dissapointed in Coursera allowing such poor quality content. I will would not recommened this course. Save your money and hard earned cash.

2020-03-11 00:00:00,René R,5.0,1.0,"Great introduction for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in cybersecurity without any prior knowledge or degree in the field. May need to do some research by yourself and lookup words just to get the full spectrum of the topic, and sometimes the audio may be hard to follow but thanks to the transcripts you can easily move forward and make notes as the course goes on. Really recommend !"

Nichts desto trotz wird auf interessante Resourcen im Web verwiesen um die Themen noch selbst weiter vertiefen zu können. Zudem wird auch immer mal wieder auf IBM Spezifische Resourcen (z.B.

2021-05-02 00:00:00,Gurunand P,2.0,1.0,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the content of this course and the quality of the materials in this course. I have taken a few other courses in the past and had a lot of expectations from this one, considering it is by IBM and is a paid course. I urge you to withdraw this course, unless Coursera/IBM can fully revamp it. 

Here are a few points that I would like to bring to your attention, as feedback. If you visit the forum, you will notice that many students have expressed similar concerns:
1. Quality of the videos:

	These videos can use significant improvements. It would be best to record these from scratch.

	As others have mentioned, the audio quality is bad, the video is subpar and the presentation skills of the presenter can use vast improvements (in many cases, not all). It is hard to believe that this came from IBM.

2. Quality of the materials:

	The content is not up to the mark. The recording/audio quality is bad, with background noises in many. The material does not even do justice to the relevant subject. 

	Here is an example - Compare this video https://coursera.org/share/791e68b6357d5e9c8ca5b8a7165dc22a with this one (on YouTube), also by IBM: https://youtu.be/z503nLsfe5s

3. You are charging for this course and I would reconsider taking it or recommend it to someone, even if it were free.

4. More on the content:

	The content is from a few years ago and may not have been updated.

	I see different dates on slides (2018, 2019, etc.) which also tells me that the they were not created for this course. It is a mix-and-match from different IBM presentations. The slide numbers mentioned by the presenter sometimes do not match the actual number.

5. Forums seem to be unmonitored:

	I barely see moderators assisting with the questions. 

	What I am stating here is nothing new and other students have provided similar feedback but no response or action over months.

6. Links to download reading materials:

	Many of the materials that I have seen so far need one to signup or register to download/view materials. IBM should have provided direct links instead of requesting one to register by providing a bunch of information.

7. I could not believe that this is an ad by IBM - a well made video, I must add: https://coursera.org/share/b93f3b1f0c5748cfd27904a013332b6c
I hope this helps you and also other students who may be considering this course - I am aware that they may not see this feedback.
Thanks

2021-01-30 00:00:00,Stephan S,2.0,1.0,"This course succeeded in giving rudimentary introduction to some key concepts in cybersecurity.  Regrettably, the audio quality is fairly poor in many places and the explanations of concepts are often extremely cursory -- in some cases limited strictly to basic vocabulary definitions without accompanying details about their purpose or importance.  The selection of lecturers from different disciplines adds interest but ultimately the mishmash of different lessons with different slides decks and presentation styles from different perspectives gives a somewhat disorganized feel.  Occasional typographic errors and omissions have slipped through, (including, ironically, leaving out the word 'security' when spelling out OWASP).  Finally, the quiz questions frequently felt as if they were composed by someone without strong understanding of the subject."
2022-04-30 00:00:00,Hajar I,2.0,1.0,Audio system sucks! Teachers talk but I can't hear anything. Explanations aren't good enough. You should provide your teachers with good microphone!

2020-06-20 00:00:00,Timur U,1.0,1.0,"Although the content of this course was important and crucial in the real IT lifestyle, some weaknesses should be mentioned. First of all, the technical support of chapters is not at an acceptable level. Sound disruption was too much. The second one, the tutoring approach. I believe that IBM will invite the professional tutors for this important course. Speach of some tutors was incoherent and not organized. I respect all tutors who tried to explain some complicated definitions easier, but probably, they know what does it mean but cannot explain it. It is a presentation skill that they need to improve or invite someone who has these skills. The last one is the assessment stage, some questions were included in module 1 but the information was in the last module only. It is confusing for learners. I wish all the best to the IBM learning team and hope these comments will be useful for further education process and business itself. "

2020-03-09 00:00:00,Dominick L,4.0,0.0,"This was a great way for me to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of cybersecurity and IT which include the CIA Triad and what each of the letters mean, firewalls and the purposes, the basics of cryptography, the history and importance of cybersecurity in the late 20th and 21st Centuries, the types of malware and security and data breaches and how to combat them, various cybersecurity and IT resources, tools and online articles, and the careers one can start in Cybersecurity and IT. 
The only critique I have with this course is that spelling and sentence structure in the paragraphs below some of the videos could be edited so that notes can be easier to read and understand in preparation for quizzes. I also do think some questions in some of the practice quizzes and end of the week quizzes could be worded better or could've been discussed more in the chapters. 
Despite this, I plan to continue with the next 3 courses to earn my certificate. I recommend this course to any college students, college graduates or those thinking of switching to IT and Cybersecurity fields. "
2022-02-24 00:00:00,Richard M,4.0,0.0,"New to the ""Certificate"" world better known as MOOC Certificates. Yall be sure to go read about MOOC's before you advance in any sort of learning program like this. Just remember its a non-credit course, and I foudn this from Coursea Support:
""The “non-credit” course will not give you any academic credit towards your college/university. Nothing is mentioned about any certificate approval or non-approval from the actual course creators, neither from Coursera."" 
This sections wasn't too bad, had a few ending quizzes that got me but understood why after re-reading the questions. I would say the worst part of this course is there are tons of transcript issues that you will see, misspelled words in quizzes and MAINLY how hard it is to understand some of these people with heavy heavy accents and horrible microphones! I would say this course needs a lot of updating in all aspects of the lesson to make a better understanding of the Introduciton to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks. 
"
2020-12-25 00:00:00,Eva I,4.0,0.0,"There is a lot of useful information here and ultimately it serves its purpose well. However, the quality of the teaching materials is uneven. Some slides are much too dense (I marked a couple of those videos in individual feedback), and much of the course is very dry. There are some gems though: the critical thinking materials in week 1 are truly original and worthwhile even to someone who already knows computer security. The teaching method they use - grounding the topic in an interesting example, and inviting the audience to think about it in advance, is a great teaching method. The course could be improved by extending it to other sections."
2021-01-21 00:00:00,Brian C,4.0,0.0,"It would sure help if your speakers had some knowledge of the English language. The men, in particular, were generally semi-literate: minimal familiarity with syntax, idiom, pronunciation, and general rules of grammar. Thankfully, the videos narrated by women were better. Course content is good, but again, PRESENTATION skills are important  (IF you want people to learn easily) so repetition of a phrase immediately following its vocalization is NOT good; ""um"" is not a word; and technical proficiency is NOT a substitute for sound teaching methodology! Learn from your mistakes!"
2021-01-02 00:00:00,Steven P,4.0,0.0,"Overall, this is a pretty good course and I learned a lot. The biggest objection I have is that sometimes I could NOT understand some of the speakers and the transcript was not much help in those situations (the transcript might say something like ""inaudible"").   I also have many years' experience in the IT field (mainly in applications, operating systems, compilers, not in cybersecurity) so I understood many references but I could understand where some less experienced individuals might not understand all references.   But, overall, I would recommend the course."
2020-09-20 00:00:00,Nicholas H,4.0,0.0,"The excellent knowledge and information is held back by occasional mic quality of the educators and in some cases, inexperience in speaking. The documented texts of their lessons mitigates these problems in most cases, but when a speaker's speech is free-flowing, it can be difficult to follow even while reading and in some instances, the computer itself misinterprets a word or simply fails to understand the word itself. Overall, a strong course that teaches the basics of Cybersecurity. Learned a lot and hope to learn more."
2020-10-18 00:00:00,Shabana N,4.0,0.0,"The course was geared to a non-IT professional like myself. It has given me valuable insights into the basics of cybersecurity, the jargon, the very fundamental tools for cybersecurity, and the impact of lax cybersecurity on organisation and individual.
One aspect may be improved: the audio could be improved in several videos, as it went low and high. Due to the variety of English accents, it was difficult to follow some of the videos.
Overall nice course; thanks to IBM for creating it. "
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Safoorah M,4.0,0.0,"The Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks was an interesting introductory course. I learned many security concepts regarding Cybersecurity. Some of the lessons were really hard to understand because they were high-security level/technical lectures. As an entry-level cybersecurity individual, it was tough to grasp the information. Overall, I enjoyed this course and hope to keep learning IBM Cybersecurity Analyst!
Thanks to all of the professors for the lessons.  "
2020-04-05 00:00:00,ANGEL F F,4.0,0.0,"In terms of the material, as an introductory course is ok. There was a lot of inconsistencies on how the slides where presented and audio quality,  so most of the times I needed to adapt to the presentators. There were some short videos that could easily be edited and prevent noises, non-audible parts and clear pronunciation when naming acronyms that were not presented in the visual material. Some of the quizes had question with no good answer.. i tried them."
2022-01-23 00:00:00,Allison P,4.0,0.0,"Hello,
The course was easy to follow and capture the essential points of the lessons. However, due to some language proficiency of some of the speakers, it was not always easy to understand what they were saying at times. Additionally, sometimes the notes or what was presented was not always covered for what was asked on some of the quizzes and tests. It was apparent though of the expertise of the speakers. Overall though this was a great introductory course."
2022-03-01 00:00:00,adam o,4.0,0.0,"the audio quality was poor in many of the videos which made it difficult to understand sometimes and I had to rewatch some of the videos several times beause of this, the information provided was very good. There were times the information provided referencedd material that was more advanced than the current topic and I would have to look up information they referenced in order to understand the topic. but otherwise the information was informative.

2020-05-13 00:00:00,PRADEEP S,4.0,0.0,"The overall course was good, but in some lecture videos the voice of the instructor was not clear and there were times when the transcript was not accurate. I was quite familier with many terms of cyber security used in the course because of which I was able to understand the correct term but I think if some one who newly start with cyber security, he will not understand many terms. I hope these things will be solved for future learners."

2020-09-27 00:00:00,Fatah A,4.0,0.0,"The course is pretty good but the lecturer in some videos is too fast and some videos have bad quality, but overall this is a really good course they bring the material professionally.

I recommend taking a look at this course and check out whether this suits you or not."
2022-09-23 00:00:00,Shayeidre C,4.0,0.0,"T​he course material was very descriptive and understandable (some were challenging!!) ! I rate a 4 due to my experience with the quizzes, some answers were marked as incorrect when they were in fact correct based on the material presented in the slides and provided by the instructors. Also, the audio for some instructors had a lot of feedback making the instructor inaudible at times. Thanks!"
2020-10-11 00:00:00,Naif A,4.0,0.0,"A good amount of the videos are not clear audio-wise and visually, some of the things are INAUDIBLE and the transcripts in those cases do not help at all. I think it would be better off for you guys and for us to update the videos with a higher resolution and a better speaker or at least for that speaker to speak through a more CLEAR microphone and take their time when saying the terms."
2022-07-20 00:00:00,Pedro S,4.0,0.0,"Ótimo curso, oferece uma visão bem detalhada sobre os conceitos princiapalmente para o lado administrativo e gerencial da Cyber Segurança.
Ele é perfeito para inciantes para esse ambiente, porém eu aconselho a ter uma base do que é a Cyber Segunrança em geral para esse curo.

O curso pode melhorar a qualdiade das imagens e do audio de alguns capitulos que são bem complicados de entender"
2020-10-13 00:00:00,Andrew N H,4.0,0.0,The quality of the sound and videos could have better and the information up to date because we are in 2020 and I found they were giving information from 2016/2017. Also the subtitle were bad for when we couldn’t understand the audio so sometimes it’s was a bit difficult. But overall I enjoyed it and I learnt a lot from this course and looking forward to continue onto a different one.
2022-07-09 00:00:00,David O,4.0,0.0,"It was a very wonderful experience and learning process. But some aspects need some re-adjustments. Like there were a couple of times whereby I was sure that I got the answers to a quiz question correct and then I end up failing the quiz. Even after I go watch the video again, I will see that the answer I picked was correct, but it will be marked wrong for me in the test."
2020-09-17 00:00:00,Racquel D,4.0,0.0,"Everything was great except for the fact that one of the instructors, his notes were not very good as they did not explain the concepts thoroughly. He also was not very good at explaining said concepts at a beginner pace. The other instructor, however, (he had an accent), his slides were excellent, and he was through at explaining the concepts in a digestible manner. "
2022-01-12 00:00:00,Becca A,4.0,0.0,"The course was quite detailed and informative, however I found the video and the presentation of the content rather low quality. It was difficult  to understand some of the topics because of the ineffective communication skill possessed by the tutor. I wasn't really impressed with the course especially because it was put together by such a reputable company as IBM. "
2022-05-11 00:00:00,Eliana K,4.0,0.0,"This is a good introductory course. I wish more specific reference material was used, such as a glossary of new terms for newcomers, and walkthroughs of real historic eventsto acompany the theory cartoons. One instructor spoke too softly and did not speak in complete thougths most of the time, causing me to have to outsource the learning concept content elsewhere. "
2020-06-26 00:00:00,Iftekhar M T,4.0,0.0,It's going to be a quality informative course for anybody getting into as well as be a super refresher for who is already in the cybersecurity field. One downside: audio quality really below the par (which is unexpected from a company like IBM) combined with some of the speakers not having good communication skills resulted in a lack of clear understanding.
2022-09-26 00:00:00,Sherman K,4.0,0.0,H​elpful introduction to someone completely green to this field. This course could use  more regular updates to materials as it is clear that some of these are more than a few years old and some links are dead. Could also be helpful if a glossary is available for terms which i suppose have been taken for granted by those more experience in the field.
2020-04-25 00:00:00,Guylian D W,4.0,0.0,"The course content was good, One speaker was not as good due to the bad use of English and low microphone quality. Luckily i could still read the dialogue under the video to understand what he was saying.
Aside from that i enjoyed the course a lot, and I'm looking forward to starting the other 3 chapters of specialization offered by Coursera and IBM."
2021-08-21 00:00:00,Daniele C,4.0,0.0,"Very good course to have a basic understanding of cybersecurity world, rich in external links and material. Some work must be done self-teaching. I do not rate 5 stars only because some lectures present transcript mistakes, a few inaudible parts here and there and some acronyms used are not explained - in those cases, Google is our friend anyway."
2021-03-07 00:00:00,Keith R,4.0,0.0,"enjoyed the break down of the course, and while i have completed other courses, still learned new things from completing this course - think the quizzes throughout the course provide much needed validation that the topics covered have been understood. Did feel that some of the videos / audio was quite low quality (background noises on occasion)."
2022-03-14 00:00:00,Jennifer N F,4.0,0.0,"I​t felt like the presentations jumped around and they sometimes refered to material outside of this course or slides that we didn't see in the presentation video. Would be nice if we also had some course material if they reference that in the course. Otherwise, this was very informational and has helped me decide if I'm into this field or not. "
2021-11-29 00:00:00,Paarth J,4.0,0.0,Very useful in terms of teaching the basics of cybersecurity and gaining surface level knowledge of the various concepts and terminology around it but the course is a bit IBM centric. Some parts of the course are unnecessary and could be removed to make the course more straightforward and direct. Everything else is very well explained.  
2021-07-03 00:00:00,Tyrone B,4.0,0.0,A few layouts along with the explanations were difficult to grasp. The accents of some of the instructors were occasionally unclear. I look to participate more in to forums. I enjoyed the course for the most part but I needed to use YouTube for a different approach to these same cyber terms and practices. Have a great day and be safe.
2021-02-03 00:00:00,Miguel A,4.0,0.0,"the course was good as far as introducing you into the world of cyber security, but I myself lost at times with the language. A lot of the terms that are used in cyber security I did not know and had to look them up on my own. Also some of the speakers on the videos were hard to understand and the subtitled reference was not accurate."
2020-06-16 00:00:00,Akshay S,4.0,0.0,It was a good course for the beginner in cyber security field.It explains all the topics related to hacking and mitigating the attacks that are performed by some hackers.It also shows us different techniques and soft skills required to be able to secure a network and help others secure.Thank you so much for such an amazing course.
2022-08-07 00:00:00,Cassiana e J ,4.0,0.0, The audio was aweful but the actual course wasnt that bad. Very informitive . The test quizes was definatly messed up because there was some answers I know was correct and it marked it wrong and finally I went back to it and it was the answer that I awsered the first time and it said I was right after I went through all of them.
2021-03-07 00:00:00,MILLEN M,4.0,0.0,"not bad i really enjoyed it, learned alot but its just that the video quality and audio quality is low, could be improved, there is also multiple presenter sometimes talking on the same chapter which is kind of distracting, english could also be improved. I also wouldnt call this completely introduction as they just talk briefly"
2020-10-14 00:00:00,Juliana R H,4.0,0.0,"It's a good course but it says you need no previous knowledge on the subjects. I come from Law and during some parts of this course I was very confused with some of the terms brought up without any explanation as if it was too basic we should all know them. Besides that, I'm very content I did it and plan to do the next ones."
2020-09-18 00:00:00,Ali A,4.0,0.0,"The materials were really good (short, precise, and informative), however, the voice quality recorded was really poor and most of times is not clear to convey the message easily. The other thing, I believe that the materials was having some lack of organized scripts which show some issues if I decide only to read the scripts."
2021-05-01 00:00:00,Jonathan D,4.0,0.0,"Easily completable and understandable. My only complaints would be that there are a fair amount of spelling/grammatical mistakes made by the presenters throughout the course, some of which makes it difficult to understand what they are saying. That being said, most of the information is presented in a clear and concise way. "
2022-05-12 00:00:00,Wellington S,4.0,0.0,"The course is good and helps you to have a basic overview about cybersecurity and what it means. It's helpfull but I hope they can bring some some interaction and more solid exercises in order to help the student to really learn the content. 
It was quite hard to understand all the content without more solid examples."
2022-08-08 00:00:00,Supriya S,4.0,0.0,"​some of the video quality is very poor. Enrolment in the certification program assumes that participants will complete week one of all 8 courses in the first week and even after paying for the course, does not give option to change the due date (contrary to what is advertised). App and website is not user friendly. "
2020-07-08 00:00:00,ANNIE L,4.0,0.0,"Content coverage is great and at just the right level of detail. Love that it is taught by IBM - top notch expertise.  However, the audio quality can be very bad, which wasn't helped by the text translations either (also bad and obviously without technical knowledge).  Overall, great course for the price and format."
2022-06-27 00:00:00,Toni C,4.0,0.0,"I found it difficult, at times, to efficiently cross-reference questions and choice of answer (in assessments) to learning materials or external learning resources due to variations in terminology used, and in some weeks we were responding to questions based on content not yet covered (was covered in a later week)."
2022-05-10 00:00:00,Grace H,4.0,0.0,"Good introduction into the entire field of cybersecurity. One suggestion would be to explain or flush out abbreviations (i.e., TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc etc). Inputting unexplained or unelaborated alphabet soup for an introduction course is potentially problematic for those who are entirely new to the subject and field. "
2021-03-11 00:00:00,Kathryn L S,4.0,0.0,"Great overview of the field of cybersecurity as a whole, good references and information. Audio could be better in a lot of places.  Sometimes difficult to understand some of the presenters.  Transcriptions also need to be checked better, as some of the terms are incorrect, based on what the presenter was saying. "
2021-02-05 00:00:00,Abraham G,4.0,0.0,"The course was interesting and informative, though I am not sure an absolute beginner would fully grasp some parts because technical terms and acronyms were thrown in here and there and I am not sure they were fully explained. The audio was not very good in some videos and some of the transcripts need some work."
2020-08-03 00:00:00,Della P,4.0,0.0,"Content is excellent but delivery is terrible. Audio for lectures is choppy and substandard. Some lecturers ramble and deviate from outline of discussion, making the module unnecessarily lengthy. Some lecturers are difficult to understand. Transcript of lectures is inaccurate and cannot be relied upon either."
2020-12-28 00:00:00,courteney w,4.0,0.0,"I would have provided a full 5 stars, but the only thing that truly took away from the courses quality was the sound quality of some of the instructors. It was hard to hear or understand at times. However, the course and instructors still provided a quality course! I am actually happy I took this course. "
2020-05-19 00:00:00,Sacha Z,4.0,0.0,"While providing a comprehensive overview of the topics, the course materials lack quality, i.e. recordings are sometimes hard to understand. The transcripts contain also many mistakes or misspellings. I have seen way nicer courses on Coursera but in the end this course is a good teaser to dig in deeper."
2020-06-21 00:00:00,Luke R,4.0,0.0,"I think it is a very good introduction course and it was great to hear from different people.  5/5 for content; however, 4/5 for the platform.  Sometimes it was difficult to hear what the instructors were saying, or the image quality was lacking.   Other than that, I am very satisfied with this course."
2020-06-26 00:00:00,Rajni B,4.0,0.0,This course provides quite abundant basic knowledge about cyber-security. They have provided enough material and articles for the help of students for further reading and to understand briefly. I want to suggest that some hands-on project  should be included in the course for practical knowledge.
2021-10-22 00:00:00,Martín R,4.0,0.0,"This course is a very good introduction to Cybersecurity, it gives you a lot of information on how technology comunication works, how to understand cybersecurity, procedures to work with security, a lot of resources where you can stay updated in cybersecuity and many important concepts."
2022-09-07 00:00:00,Robert F,4.0,0.0,"Good course with great info, but having slides with misspellings makes you wonder how valid the info is.  It is also 2022 almost 2023 and the slides and videos are from 2018 or before.  How much has cybersecurity changed in that time.  So I guess maybe update and proofreads are needed"
2020-08-05 00:00:00,Aaron V,4.0,0.0,"I incredibly suggest clear audio and professional verbal communications, I kept having the need to re-watch the videos because of people stuttering or not speaking English in a correct way. Other than that I liked the shortness of the course and John who was clear with specifications"
2021-08-18 00:00:00,Mary A J,4.0,0.0,"L​earned a lot, but unable to negotiate Coursera easily. Difficult for me to understand some IBM SMEs and challenged to pull everything together for the first of the eight modules (hoping next module will be less challenging)! Thank you to all that made this course available online."
2020-08-09 00:00:00,Roman D,4.0,0.0,"Presented information is very interesting for beginners. I'm filling that some parts should be updated a  little using modern reports and trends. Also, I was sad that can't complete some quizzes by some technical issues. Kindly wait for the update and wish you good luck at all."
2020-02-16 00:00:00,Robert R,4.0,0.0,"The information from this course is fantastic.  The instructors have so much knowledge but at times their message was a bit obscured and hard to understand.  That, is not a problem since I use the note feature a lot.  The problem is the note feature gets it wrong at times. "
2022-01-09 00:00:00,Alvin V,4.0,0.0,Good intro for a guy like me that knows very little about cybersecurity. Probably the most useful part to me was all the resources that the instructors direct students to look over. I'll be regularly scouring those websites for updates on the latest in cybersecurity.
2020-07-05 00:00:00,Harshvardhan W,4.0,0.0,"This is a great course to give you an overview of the different processes and procedures in cyber-security. It doesn't go into the details of how something is done, by outlines the general roadmap and what factors should be taken into account while building one."
2021-10-18 00:00:00,Fabio B S D R M,4.0,0.0,"Very Good Intro to Cyber Sec, cover well the basics.

2022-08-22 00:00:00,Benjamin C,4.0,0.0,Very informative and great introduction to cybersecurity. Some of the drawbacks were the low video and audio quality in some of the videos and that a few of the instructors were a bit hard to understand because they may not be native English speakers.
2021-04-16 00:00:00,Bakry M,4.0,0.0,"Really informative course covering the foundations. The only 2 things I didn't like about the course were the poor sound quality in some parts, and the fact that some instructors simply read points from their slides without providing much explanation."
2021-02-19 00:00:00,Adam I B,4.0,0.0,"Before taking the course I have had no idea or information about cybersecurity and curiosity brought me to this course. After completing the course I have gained basic knowledge about cybersecurity, but video and materials need improvement.

2020-10-27 00:00:00,Ricardo L,4.0,0.0,The overall course was thorough and informative. The audio quality of some videos could be better. Some concepts could have been explained more clearly and you really have to concentrate to follow some videos. Could be modernised and sharpened.
2021-07-29 00:00:00,Raghav S,4.0,0.0,I am thankful for the opportunity coursera has provided to me. This course is good for the people seeking mostly theory. There is very little application taught. The course could have been better if the audio and video qualities were good.
2020-12-22 00:00:00,Sharlotte F,4.0,0.0,"Great course and intro to theory, concepts and terminology on cybersecurity. The production value in some of the audio is lacking though, would be great if they all matched the audio that was used to introduce each topic. Otherwise great."
2020-05-04 00:00:00,Luiz M,4.0,0.0,"Content is very good but quality of the material (media) could be improved.
Some tutors knows a lot but do not speak in a understandable language for beginners (technical terms on content)
Overall satisfaction is good for the time invested."
2021-10-03 00:00:00,Rodolfo F,4.0,0.0,"This course is a good way to start learning cybersecurity, with some good classes and resources. On the other hand, some information shared need to be updated and the audio in some classes could be better. Otherwise, great intro course."

2022-03-03 00:00:00,FELIPE-ANTONIO L,4.0,0.0,"Good introduction to cybersecurity. Too much theory at some point. The key problem is that some recordings are really bad quality. Others, like Kenneth Gonzalez ones, were very good and easy to learn from."
2020-07-10 00:00:00,Muhammad H,4.0,0.0,"Overall, the instructors were good and the content was very much informative mainly for beginners but I think they should have taught us about how to use a specific tool which they discussed in the course."
2022-04-22 00:00:00,Adam K,4.0,0.0,The course offered a wealth of information about cybersecurity.  The one problem was that sometimes the speakers and the text did not match up.  Other than that it was an informative and enjoyable course.

The firewall and cryptography parts were very shallow (even considering it's a simple introduction) and boring and i got better free content from YouTube related to these subjects. 
I had a constant feeling that a wasn't getting all the introduction i needed (i always felt that a could not explain what a learned it to someone else) so I paused this course lots times to complete my understandings by reading and watching extra free content outside Coursera, that sometimes were better than this paid course.
I still recommend it because there's a structure to follow and i helps in a first approach. I also recommend this book: How Cybersecurity Really Works, by Sam Grubb -> this book complements this course 1 of IBM.
Even with a 3/5 experience in the course 1 i'm looking forward to start the course 2, for i clearly need some suggested organization to learn about Cybersecurity.

2020-07-19 00:00:00,Robert W,3.0,0.0,"While there is plenty of very useful information in this course, there are several things that could be vastly improved. The test questions are sometimes oddly phrased and material that is not learned until Week 4 is tested in Week 1 (white hat, grey hat, black hat hackers) . There are several one question quizzes that seem arbitrary (ex. ""What did this SOC Analyst say was the most useful tool for him?""). In Week one's Critical Thinking section, there appears to be a video that stops halfway. My biggest criticism is that this is a beginner level course but the instructors will throw out technical jargon that doesn't get defined until later in the course, if at all. The following video is the same video but it shows the whole thing.  This has potential to be a truly great class but, IBM should really review this course, see what they can streamline, and identify what it is they want people to take away from this class. "
2021-08-09 00:00:00,Niels R,3.0,0.0,"The information in this course is not bad, however I want to issue a complaint about the quality of the English transcriptions, which is far below the mark. It seems they are either computer-generated or made by someone with poor hearing and no understanding of the context and/or subject matter. Even a layman who has read the material as a whole, could do a better job. Some of the presenters also explain things using examples, without first explaining the issue in general terms, leaving the learner guessing as to which part of the example is or isn't relevant to the explanation. Some of the quiz questions do not refer to materials discussed in the lecture (example: a question about Vulernability Assessment Methodology in week 1 or 2, while it is explained in week 4!)"
2020-10-26 00:00:00,Nathan W,3.0,0.0,"Honestly, I really enjoyed the content and thought the information they said while doing the presentations was great. The problem is IBM seem to be using the worst mic I have ever heard. Like you can see it was done in 2018 but they could afford to give the Lecturer a decent mic?? Unfortunate, else this would be a very good course, its just hard to understand what there actually saying. Even the subtitles don't know what they say sometimes... 

Also to note, the quizes are really hard because it doesn't even say what I tried to answer. Disappointing, all the other courses I've done on Coursera at least let me see what I got right and wrong. And then video quality look 360p at times, terrible production quality."
2020-06-30 00:00:00,Yadira M,3.0,0.0," I think the information being discussed and shared is great, the quality of the videos is not good at all though. The audio is different on every video and I you can barely see what's being displayed on the slides, even when I change to higher quality on the settings. I appreciate the industry leaders providing their insight but there's too many ""umms"" and not enough well spoken presenters. I don't mean to be harsh because I think the content is good but you can barely understand what they are saying. Perhaps someone who's confident & does presentations often should do them. I would even lower the volume on the videos and tried to read what they are saying at the bottom but even that barely makes sense. "
2022-08-16 00:00:00,Laura P,3.0,0.0,"Es un curso muy básico, te brinda conocimientos clave en muchos aspectos de la ciberseguridad, pero dan mucha vuelta a ciertas ideas o conceptos, hay cosas que es innecesario repetir y repetir el mismo concepto, el tiempo es algo que no regresa y me disgustó que lo ocupen en repetirte las mismas ideas, de hecho hay conferencias en las que te pueden decir la idea en un minuto y no dar vuelta a lo mismo en 14 minutos.
Otra situación que veo es que hay instructores que tienen fallas en su micrófono o en su conexión de internet y eso provoca que el audio sea pésimo porque se escucha mal y encima de eso tienen mala dicción entonces no se entiende lo que dicen y su discurso se hace incomprensible."
2021-05-09 00:00:00,Monique S,3.0,0.0,"I think overall the way the course is offered is great. There were a few things that I found could use improvement. Audio is definitely something that could use an overhaul. The other thing is the way the information is conveyed. A lot of times the speaker was not only hard to understand, but the delivery made for a bit of confusion. It might help to write out what is going to be said rather than to wing it. Also, the word ""So"" is overused as well- some improvements in the English department would do a lot of good. Overall, you can certainly learn a basic understanding of Cybersecurity from this course. The convenience of fitting it into a busy life is the best thing about this. "
2021-07-27 00:00:00,Eduardo A T C,3.0,0.0,"I​t's alright as an introduction of the world of Cybersecurity. The selection of topics is neat, I just wish the execution was a lot better. The audio quality is really bad for most of the lectures, you'd expect that IBM would have the budget to give good mics to their instructors in 2018. Some of the slides are really bad depending on the instructor, the text is really squished together and for some reason they are plastered with comic sans as a font and silly stock images. Can't say I regret taking this course but I would say it's only for absolute beginners to the topic"
2022-05-27 00:00:00,Sharice J,3.0,0.0,"T​his course is very informational and is user / beginner friendly in regards to navigation. An area that can use improvement is the audio and the transcript of the videos. Those 2 aspects are crucial to student learning as they contain the information needed to learn the topics covered. The audio is often impossble to decipher and the transcript is also unable to understand it. Lots of information I had to utilize outside sources to cover due to the course. Aside from that, great course! It was a review for me mostly and some new information learned as well. Thank you :)"
2022-05-09 00:00:00,Igor' A,3.0,0.0,"Generally good content, but poor and unorganised delivery. The same is throughout other courses within this specialisation. Sometimes the topics are presented at very high level, and our of suddent the next video jumps really deep in details without enough prep or context, than again goes high level. 
Some of the presenters are hard to understand because of accents or poor sound quality.
Overall, it is hard to piece the whole picture out of individual vides and courses in the specialisation together; as if the specialisation lacks a logical end to end syllabus."
2020-10-08 00:00:00,Theodore W,3.0,0.0,"The course materials were unevenly elaborated, some concepts were very well explained others were not. I would suggest that on topics involving novice audience, it is very important to properly articulate and teach as opposed to delivering lectures. Sometimes, when the audience is more advanced on a subject matter, lecture format would be very helpful. But this course is usually taken by individuals who don't know anything about computers or security. We cannot perceive lecture format about specialized cyber security events as well as professionals can. "
2021-12-08 00:00:00,Suman P,3.0,0.0,"kind of average course. Most of the instructors doesn't explain some of the vast topics as in a understandable manner. They seemed to be lazy while teaching and there were some disturbance sound in the background. Moreover, this part of the course mostly focuses on the rules and regulations kind of stuffs mostly related to US. there are students watching outside from US also. Overall the contents of this course is outstanding but as a student it is hard for us to understand hard topics with less explanations. I hope this to be improved."
2022-01-20 00:00:00,Timothy E G,3.0,0.0,"Some of the Speakers on the courses, while knowledgeable, no disrespect to them or their skills - they should NOT be used to convey the information required throughout this course. It's a very technical and terminology-heavy course, yet you can barely comprehend what they're saying as english is definitely not even close to their first language. please replace 2 or 3 of the speakers with actual clearly audible speakers. Otherwise the course was great, interactive, holds your attention and generally enjoyable to work through."
2020-10-22 00:00:00,Alexia K,3.0,0.0,"Overall an informative course BUT there are some serious issues. For example, the content was very repetitive at various points. Additionally, some of the video content is of very low quality (e.g. we cannot see the slide content well or we cannot listen to the speaker clearly). Some improvements will be necessary for the course to be of better value. Right now, it seems like someone took clips from different talks/presentations and tried to compile them into a course (sometimes not successfully..)"

Presentation skills need to be improved, speaking clearly, better slides, improve their skills on teaching, etc.

Some lectures aren't well explained, some videos have audio error. As this is a beginner level course and the basic step to Cybersecurity, the course should have been explained in a detailed manner and easy way. Still 1,2 teachers were good. I didn't need to study some things after listening the videos. Thank you for making it possible for us to learn."

I was able to absorb a lot of information that will guide me trough this ""career change"" path. I'm starting the second course. Thanks!"
2021-03-29 00:00:00,Livia K,3.0,0.0,"The course was really great for those who want to have an overview of the main topics in Cybersecurity. However, the audio wasn't good and, because the professors were, most of them, from different countries, it was really complicated to understand them, even if you are fluent in English. So, I was trying to read the subscription, but I missed the slides . If the subscription was inserted on the video, it would be more pleasant for the students. Congrats!"
2020-09-15 00:00:00,Poh S Y,3.0,0.0,"There are many parts of the video where the speakers are not audible and the corresponding text is not helpful as well given it is a mere replication of the voice-text. This impedes actual understanding of the content. Moreover, while branded as a beginner course, the speakers used many different technical terms without explaining what they actually mean e.g. TCP, UDP, FTP etc. It's complicated for non-tech students to follow through. "
2021-07-12 00:00:00,Frank B,3.0,0.0,S​ome of the disertations where it names the US (eledge) as one of the responsible of the creation of the Stuxnet virus assumes that it was part of the confabulation when in reality that has not been confirmed plus other implications to other nation states as responsbile for cyber attacks.  The course left aside the legal frame of why being the US the country that receives most of the attacks it is unable to respond in accordance.

>> Improve the quality of the content in the slides
>> Make URLs referenced in slides available/clickable in the script text

2021-11-03 00:00:00,Soraya B,3.0,0.0,"The content of this introductory course is great but the delivery is rather disappointing. Sound quality is often poor, as if the courses were extracted from a live webinar.

Finally, the videos are slow to load and there are also regularly typos on the slides.

Additionally, some instructors, while highly knowledgeable in the subject matter seemed to lack proficient communications skills and were, at times difficult to comprehend."
2022-02-27 00:00:00,Mojgan,3.0,0.0,"some courses were extremely difficult to understand as the lecturer accent was very unclear. Some lecturers using words like ""forexample"" over 3 times in 2 sentences which I found annoying. I found some of the lectures difficult to understand due to the way it was explained by the lecturer which was not at all clear and took me longer to learn.  In most of the videos the voice quality was not very good."

But, the sound quality is really bad in most of the videos and the feeling I got is that the course was prepared fast, with cheap equipment (maybe through phone calls - not even using a proper mouse) and with no intention to update it (old links even from 2016, some not working anymore). Disappointing quality from a company like IBM."
2022-08-10 00:00:00,John B,3.0,0.0,"Thank you for the course!  Comprehensive, but some of the Pentest links are old, as well as some of the training slides.

2021-04-06 00:00:00,Daisy A,3.0,0.0,Some parts of the course were a little difficult to understand because of the organization. The presenters in some of the parts were jumping around or not fully explaining a concept which made it a little difficult to follow.

2022-09-07 00:00:00,Catie D,3.0,0.0,"Overall, not a bad course. However, it went from being pretty basic with introductory principles and key terms to VERY difficult with lots of jargon. Im wondering if for an intro course, maybe it would be worth explaining some of this further even with entry level industry professionals. Other than that, it was pretty good. A bit long in some weeks but good! "
2020-06-22 00:00:00,Hemaraj D,3.0,0.0,Your content is very good but the sound quality is very worse not getting anythings. please put with good sound quality.

The course cannot be best without audio with is everything and and the quality of sound is low that the microphone that you are using is less than a dollar. 
2020-07-07 00:00:00,Ana D,3.0,0.0,"Some of the material is repetitive (f.e. talks about the same exact classification of threaths in weeks 1,2 & 3). I feel there wasn't a good communication between the lecturers, hence the repetition. At some videos audio was really bad. Otherwise, the course gives a good, but brief introduction. Hope the next one in the specialisation is better. "

However, some of the audio was difficult to understand, I often felt like the instructor was reading off of a slide rather than elaborating and providing context or simple examples, and the general flow of the course didn't really make sense to me."
2022-09-08 00:00:00,Nathan T,3.0,0.0,"T​he material is good, however the quality of the presentations vary wildly. Some of the presenters sound like their microphones are in a bath tub in the other room, while others sound like they were recorded with a microphone next to a conference room speaker.

2020-11-21 00:00:00,Oren K,3.0,0.0,"This is supposed a course for beginners, with no background at all. The lecturers use many technical terms that are unknown for students without any prior knowledge.

I was expecting more since this course seemed to get a decent rating based on Coursera user feedback. The course provides some very helpful resources to go back to later when learning more about cybersecurity and keeping up with the most up to date news and research. The course attempts to teach important concepts, but the lecture delivery method is just poor. 
For starters, the video lecture designs were just sloppy -- poor audio recordings, typos on the slides and in the written transcripts, slide graphics were not visible most of the time (even when viewing in full-screen mode). Many acronyms and terms were not clearly defined or defined at all. This should be a number 1 priority for a beginners' course. The written transcripts for each of the lecture slide simply just transcribed the audio and did not correct any transcription mistakes when they appeared. There should also be helpful written guides creating outlines for each of the units and the terms/concepts presented.

This course has a 7-day free trial, but I canceled before the trial was over. It is not worth paying for something where there is clearly very little effort put into making the course. 
Overall disappointed because I expected more from IBM since they have top experts in this field."
2021-06-28 00:00:00,Andrew F,2.0,0.0,"I am always grateful for free access to learning, but this was not amazing.
The course seems like it was patched together from disconnected fragments of old IBM training sessions. The audio quality is often poor. The subtitles are full of errors and [inaudible] tags. The presenters are doubtless knowledgeable, but often do not teach very well. For a beginner course, acronyms and technical language appear frequently without explanation. The explanations are sometimes good, but only sometimes. At other times, I found myself losing the thread of the lecture repeatedly.
The quiz questions are sometimes badly written and force you to guess what they mean. Others simply do not support the learning well. For example, instead of asking you about the concepts, they might test you on exactly what wording was used on a particular slide.
The quality of the slides is also highly variable. Some are fine. Others are garbled acronym salads with incomprehensible diagrams and ancient clip-art, featuring text that is multicoloured for no obvious reason and entirely in Comic Sans. I swear this is true.
It is still great to have free access to information. If you are interested, then it might be worth your time. But personally I could not recommend that anybody pays the monthly subscription fee for this."
2020-08-24 00:00:00,Aaron W,2.0,0.0, I signed up for the 7 Day Free Trail for the IBM Cyber-security Analyst Professional Certificate. This is definitely a cert I would be interested in completing but unfortunately the lecture audio is so bad that I will have to un-enrollment as I can't justify shelling out $49 per month for such terrible and unclear audio quality and instructors. The material itself seems interesting but I literally cannot hear or understand 75% of what the presenter is trying to say in the lectures. I tried turning on the subtitles but that's just no way to learn... Unfortunate because I think this certification path has potential but I could literally create a YouTube video on my $300 laptop with no special equipment that would sound better than what IBM is putting out here. I bought a Security+ course on Udemy for $9.99 and it seems to basically have all the same type of material plus the lecture audio / instructor is clear and concise in their presentation.     
2021-04-13 00:00:00,James M A,2.0,0.0,"With an IT course, (especially from IBM) I believe the quality of production such as audio and video should be top notch. In many of the presentations, the audio sounds like it is in a hallway or in the background. Very poor audio. A cheap dedicated microphone would solve this issue and sound more professional. I expect more from IBM. Also, it seems the terminology is all over the place and the lessons don't seem to have any order to them. Many of the speakers' English skills were not at a native level, so sometimes it was difficult to pick up on the technical jargon. I am an ESL teacher and I welcome multilingual individuals, but with a professional course, I believe this should be done by native English speakers. If this course was for Spanish learners, I would expect a native Spanish instructor for ease of learning. I feel I didn't learn much with this course."
2020-10-02 00:00:00,Cameron L,2.0,0.0,"This course is very summary-level. After taking, I realized the whole specialization/certificate would likely provide only a cursory overview of the field, and nothing close to what would be required get a job in this area. I think one could learn more about cybersecurity from perusing wikipedia than they could with this course. 
Additionally, this course seems hastily put together, with many different speakers from lesson to lesson. Each host offers a wildly different level of knowledge and didactic ability. I get the feeling the lessons were spliced together from some sort of internal training process, where the cyber team was trying to educate management and other departments on what exactly they do. 
The arbitrary nature of quiz questions reinforces the idea that not much thought was put into the overall informational value of this course.

2021-10-14 00:00:00,S K,2.0,0.0,"While the information is fair/good, it is very difficult to grasp as the recordings are very low in quality compared to many other online courses. Additionally, some instructors speak with an accent, which complicates things much more than needed. In fact, if some of the transcripts read (inaudible). Lastly, it seems that it would be much better if the instructors would follow a prewritten script. I find myself focusing too much on the flaws rather than the content. As a note, I speak two languages and English is my second. My wife is of Latin descent and I am used to listening to accents, but it still makes it very challenging to get through the course material. Hopefully, IBM will revise this course using better delivery methods. Nonetheless, I'll continue with the course as I am determined to earn my certification."
2022-07-13 00:00:00,Pedro D,2.0,0.0,"I am surprised by the lack of professionalism in some of the videos presented in this course. It felt as though some of the instructors did not practice what they were going to teach before they presented in the class. The course material does give you a solid understanding CyberSecurity and if you have any experience in IT or CyberSecurity, you should do just fine in this course. The biggest issue I have though is that the exams at the end of each course force you wait 8 hours  if you fail the exam to take it again.  I think IBM did this so that nonone could zoom through their course, but it really stifles learning when you have to wait that long. I think if they changed it to 3 hours it might satisfy more people, myself included. "
2022-03-12 00:00:00,Kelsey C,2.0,0.0,"If you've ever taken an IBM training before, you'll know what to expect here. 
PROS: Provides a functional introduction to cybersecurity and will give you foundational knowledge like terminology, roles, types of threats and threat actors etc.
CONS: Audio quality is poor in several videos - I used the transcripts to get through. The course is very repetitive and seems pieced together from unrelated recordings someone shoehorned into a single course. Some videos contradict each other or add confusion rather than building on previous knowledge.
If you just need to get the basics and the language down, I recommend this course. However, I recommend you just read the transcripts, skim a couple videos, and generally blaze through it."
2020-06-01 00:00:00,Selisa S,2.0,0.0,"This was a challenge.  Between the Audio issues and some of the Translations and the Dialects, OMG I was so over it.  I had to go over this several times.  This was a complete Headache.  I was stressed and constantly SMH.  I just wanted this to be over with.  I was really hoping for the better.  The best part of all of this was the lady that comes on for the Introduction.  She was so very clear and speaks very well.  Please please get instructors to have visuals with Most of the lessons and have more content relevant to the Quiz/Practice Questions.  I feel for the Translators.  This was challenging but I got through it and I am extremely reluctant on completing another course.  Thank you for your time and consideration."
2020-09-12 00:00:00,Leo K H,2.0,0.0,"The quality of the video lecture is quite bad.  Some lectures have inaudible parts.  This is made worse as the slides are not comprehensive on their own.  The video lectures are not engaging.  The presentations are frequently not smooth.  The presentation style is more suited for conference presentation and not helpful for lesson lecture.  Frequently, a static slides is shown and voiced over for more than 2 minutes.  Some animations may be good for highlighting important parts and capturing audience attention.  An ok course if you just wanna sit back, relax and get an impression of the topic.  But if you are serious about learning cybersecurity, this does not make for a pleasant experience."
2022-05-05 00:00:00,Christina M,2.0,0.0,"This course was difficult enough on its own.  But when you add in someone who's english is very hard to understand, and then mix it with improper transcripts, it makes learning this information, unnecisarily more difficult.  It would not be that hard to rerecord these videos.  And to have someone trancribe them, then send them to the person who did the video, to review the words chosen for the transcript.  
Also some of the videos had very poor quality. The sound was near impossible to hear.  And the images were very blurry. The transcription is of poor quality in some areas.  You are expecting us to learn this and not providing acurate or easy to understand instrucions on how to learn.  "
2021-06-07 00:00:00,william k,2.0,0.0,"It's a good intro, but seems really cheesy.  It feels like they did a whole lecture, but then broke it down to fit into this online course.  They will reference slides, but we haven't seen the other ones yet.  And then the sound quality is really bad.  Some sound like they are in a bunker somewhere.  And the worst part if that when you read the text below the video, you'll see things like (inaudible).  So you're not given the actual lecture notes - it's someone just listening to it at some other time, and not understanding it.  With all of this it seems very unprofessional and you have to wonder if it's worth paying for, and what this website is all about."
2020-06-14 00:00:00,Brendon R,2.0,0.0,"The speech to text within the course was not really all that great and there was no addendum's or corrections to these mistakes. Further, the instructor did make a few mistakes which was also not rectified. To which I only picked up while I was listening to a cyber security audio book, Dawn of the Code War. I highly recommend that these are fixed and I hope that this doesn't occur on the courses where you can complete a capstone project? The information contained and progression on this was good and hopefully will have given me a good foundation for when I go to apply for the Applied Technology Focusing in Cyber Security Degree next year. 
Cheers, Brendon"
2022-07-20 00:00:00,William M,2.0,0.0,"The course audio quality is very poor. Each video has a brief introduction describing what the video goals and objectives are. That audio is fine. However, once the lesson begins, the instructor voice volume is low and unclear. It is like listening to a recorded telephone call. I spent a lot of time watching the transcript and not the video. Even the transcripts have many areas labeled [inaudible].
The audio quality is distracting and time consuming. I will choose another certificate provider.
Edit: I lowered my rating of this course after taking courses offered by other providers with much better quality material."
2020-09-29 00:00:00,André V,2.0,0.0,"I'm now one week in and I have to say I was surprised about the poor quality of the course. the information within the course is good although some things aren't really regarded as basics BUT all videos so far are with poor audio quality, and just a few powerpoint slides with some pictures of graphs.. I feel like I'm in university again. it's hard to enjoy the content cause it's so ""black and white"" and not engaging enough. it would be great to have better prepared courses in which maybe the people directly talk to you via good quality video and audio so you feel more inclined to follow what they say.

2020-07-18 00:00:00,Gregg A,2.0,0.0,"[Poorly produced videos - Horrible audio. Verbose and confusing grammar from some speakers]
The audio quality of the video, specially the presenters, are often bad as I mentioned in my comments on each. The delivery as well needs your close attention as more often the way the presenters speak were not intelligible and verbose. I heard sniffing sounds and encountered varying volume levels on speakers' presentation, made worse by wrong grammatical expressions. I can't help but replaying the videos of skipping them.
 The content needs updating as I saw slides dated 2018."
2020-09-06 00:00:00,Thomas A,2.0,0.0,"The content of the course is good, without a question. But the way it's presented is not the kind i would expect it from a company like IBM. The sound quality of half of the videos is very poor. Sometimes it sounds as if it was recorded during a long distance phone call. One video obviously was recorded in an office while a tenacious visitor standing outside keeps knocking on the door. As most of the content is delivered by those videos, at most half of them in bad quality and hard to understand it does not really encourage you to keep on learning."
2021-12-13 00:00:00,Zane J,2.0,0.0,"B​ad audio, at times incomprhensible sentences. The audio should be clear, with no background noises. Some speakers had their audio recorded from their earphone microphones. Not acceptable. No glossary, so some terms and abbreviations used stay a mystery... Some speakers were to monotone, it was difficult to keep attention. Some deviated from their main thought mid-sentence, then jumped to a different topic, then back to the original thought. Some speakers basically read the slides.
I do not think this was worth my money."
2020-12-20 00:00:00,Iain W B,2.0,0.0,"The course relies on
memory, not understanding.  The audio was almost unintelligible, at times
it sounded as if the lecturers were speaking from a satellite phone.
The course jumped from
being extremely slow, in the first modules, to reliance on understanding of
abbreviations that sometimes only have relevance in the US.  There was little mention of European
contrasts.
The assertion that this
course requires little or no background knowledge is false.  It’s a good job that I had years of prior
experience in this field."
2021-08-02 00:00:00,Jason P,2.0,0.0,"The content is in-line with an intro to cyber security course, however, the questions and materials are plagued by grammar and spelling errors. Some of the quiz questions are incredibly vague leaving too much room for interpretation. The quizzes seem to test for semantics and memory of frivolous details over practical content. It's obvious IBM (or whoever they contracted) did not put much effort into this. Needs a good edit and overhaul but otherwise a good review of the basics. "
2022-04-27 00:00:00,Jan E,2.0,0.0,"The  course has quality content, however I expect from the instroctors to put a mic while recording the content to have a clear sound (most of the course content is obviously recorded from a laptop mic), not all instructors speaks proper english, and course content needs to be updated (newest content is 2019) it's a field that changes by the hour!
All said, the course is super beginner friendly, but I Expected better audio, graphics, and overall experience from coursera and IBM."
2021-08-05 00:00:00,Caleb P,2.0,0.0,"The information is good, but the presentation of it *really* needs work.

It feels like an early 2000's YouTube tutorial. Everything is grainy (even at the highest quality available - 720p), the sound quality is sub-par, and the instructors talk as if they're being held hostage.

I would say to find another course to study cybersecurity with, and perhaps just avoid all of IBM's courses entirely. If this one feels poorly made, I can't imagine how the others would be."
2020-08-23 00:00:00,Lisa N,2.0,0.0,"If I hadn't already taken the Open P-tech course I wouldn't have gotten very much from this one. It was difficult to understand many of the speakers and the transcripts were poorly done. I got more clarity on many topics from notes from the other P-tech course and simply by doing Google search on others. IBM should not allow this course to be published as is. However, I did learn a few things I didn't get from the other course hence 2 stars rather than none."
2020-11-19 00:00:00,KELLY K,2.0,0.0,There are quite a few errors in the written translation where the words in the written translation are not what was said by the presenter. The course was tedious. Some of the speakers were hard to understand and were not very good at oral presentation. There was too much overlap and the course could be substantially shortened without losing the core information convey in the course. I was disappointed by this course and had expected that it would be better.
2021-01-06 00:00:00,Anton M,2.0,0.0,"This course is not sufficiently polished to be worth the Coursera subscription fee. The low quality of the audio recordings for the presentations, the standard of written English and attention to detail make this a flawed product. From the course forums I note these issues have been raised by other students previously with apparent minimal improvement. As a world leading company IBM should take ownership and address these issues if they value their brand. "
2021-03-30 00:00:00,Julie R,2.0,0.0,"The audio quality of this is so bad that even there are [inaudible] sections sprinkled through the course. It's obviously being recorded over the phone, but can't IBM afford a decent audio engineer? The instructors often ramble, and the questions at the end of each question sometimes reference things that were only referred to obliquely by the instructors. Not impressed at all, especially given the IBM name. I'll stick with LInkedIn Learning or Udemy."

I really was trying to finish within 7 days for my free trial, but took longer than it should have, which is very frustrating."

Very unfortunate as I was looking forward to an IBM certification but for now, I'll look elsewhere."
2022-04-06 00:00:00,Ryan B,2.0,0.0,"Audio quality is an issue (significant); simply refer to the AI generated transcripts. Most of the work in this course was listening to the lecturers. A minor secondary complaint would be the sheer number of acronyms and the reliance on them, more often than not to the detriment of understanding the thing represented by said acronym(s), though I suspect this an issue within the field itself more broadly."
2020-07-25 00:00:00,David G M,2.0,0.0,"Good Intro but not getting deep enough as I have expected. There are no tools with which interact/train with, such as SIEM apps (OSSIM) for instance.

You will get better help from a Youtube tutorial. If you're only doing it because you need some form of proof that you understand some cybersecurity concepts then this course is fine as you will earn certificates. You will also walk away with no real-world required knowledge of the cybersec industry today(2022). Course consists of a lot of self-read assignments where most topics and concepts can be overwhelming for someone who just stepped into the cybersec industry. Some slides are copied from other resources and not original. Some slides are also very hard to understand as the words are all over the place. Slides are eddited poorly and you have to make sense of it all on your own. For some this might not be a problem but for some students this can be very frustrating because understanding this topic is crucial. Best of luck to you if you decide to proceed in this course. Just breathe and remain patient till the end."

Very disappointing course this. But yeah, the information of this course is very useful. The matter is, It was very hard to get those information cause poor quality of course and course arrangement. I would like to give an example to see, ""how should a professional course looks like!"". yeah, see google, see their professional course's videos. I have completed almost 3 courses from Coursera and this is the worse experience. Very disappointed. What I want to say that, re-arrange this course and upgrade the quality thus anyone can easily get this. I mean at least clear vocal and talking style.  "
2019-12-08 00:00:00,Sarah U,1.0,0.0,"Technically, the content of the class is good, but the audio presentation is very hard to follow since the speakers talk very fast, very speer-of-the moment and with very strong accents. 

Also, what had me frustrated that in the four major final quizes at the end of each week, I was only able to review my mistakes or lacks in one week. For all the other weeks everytime I clicked the button to review the quiz's mistakes it just led me to a blank page, which was not very helpfull. Under the same circumstances it happened that it didn't matter how I changed my answers for the questions I was unsure about, I remaind with the same grade, therefore I failed two assignments left to not knowing why."
2020-05-11 00:00:00,David A V E,1.0,0.0,"As someone who majored in Computer Science, and has a little bit of Cyber security experience, this course was very basic, I do not recommend you take this course if you have a similar background.
Now, when it comes to content quality, I have seen much much better. This is the same for the organization and presentation of the course's contents. I was extremely disappointed with the quality I was presented, given that it's IBM who's making this course. I found myself STRUGGLING to finish this course and get on with better ones.
My advice: There are better courses out there, and you should take this course only if you have no (or extremely limited) knowledge of the basics of cyber security."
2021-11-26 00:00:00,Christopher S,1.0,0.0,"T​his is really not very good.  You get to listen to non-native English speakers drone on for about 5 times as long as it takes to read the transcript for the video.  There are some basic Power Point slides that you could look at, but this information is so general and long-winded that you're going to be a lot more efficient and a lot more informed using other resources.  I made it through the first 45 minutes or so by reading the transcripts and feel that I learned very little.  Maybe the rest of the course is better, and you're welcome to find out for yourself.  I can't understand why professionals can't do a better job of presenting information than is found in newspaper articles."

2021-04-23 00:00:00,Isaac T,1.0,0.0,"I learned from this course an important lesson: that experts on a field may not necessarily constitute to be instructors. This course needs a review of the presentation and the flow of their information. The knowledge is good, but it is repetitive and doesn't build and complement each other. It seems like the instructors are doing their own lessons and don't know what the other instructors are doing. It would be essential to partake in higher-quality recordings and communication practice. It seems that the instructors often get their sentences mixed up and so makes the flow choppy. "
2021-06-02 00:00:00,Richard M R,1.0,0.0,"Avoid this course. I learned more in 1.5 days on the Georgia State university Foundation course than from 2 weeks on this one. The presenters spoke unintelligibly, and when it was possible to interpret what they said, it was usually not relevant to cyber security. The subtitles were machine derived and had not been checked, so even the subtitles could not make sense of what the presenters said. The presentations were badly set out and planned, with the presenters changing their mind about what they wanted to say half way through a sentence. All in all, a waste of my time. "

I was very surprised given the high rating of the course and hoped the instructor might change, but after partway into Week 2, I looked through the comments which confirmed my experience, and decided to give up and find a course elsewhere.

I ended up reading as much as I could through most of the material instead of watching the videos and I barely passed the quiz material. I ended up googling most of the information on my own.

The course is so superficial that you basically only learn some terminology. After this course, you will not have gained any applicable or employable skills. This course is produced by IBM, one of the biggest tech company, you would expect they could do better.

Further, the course was almost exclusively audio, with only 3rd party material in written form, which means you had to ingest the information at an impossibly slow pace. Some of the questions on the exams related to figures that were out of date, so there was no point in having learned or memorized them. I am discontinuing this course in favor of a book."
