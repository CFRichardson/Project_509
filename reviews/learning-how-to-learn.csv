2019-03-22,Szymon K,4.0,154.0,"I've learned a ton from this course. It encouraged me to look at some of the techniques I've already known from a fresh perspective. One caveat, though, is that I feel the course could've been slightly more practical - possibly having more actionable tasks included, such as ""Practice deliberate practice for 25 minutes on a project of choice, then journal about it"". Moreover, I feel it didn't cover memory palaces well enough, which I believe is a great tool for memorization. For anyone interested, I'd recommend to look up https://mullenmemory.com for more (which, by the way, I've discovered following Nelson Dellis, who has been interviewed in the LHTL course).
To sum up, I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more efficiently.

2017-08-19,Patrick M,1.0,134.0,"this course states tons of info that is obvious. I mean tons. at one point the instructor says if there is a class review before a test it would be a good idea to attend. At another point her colleague says you can get a lot of intellectual stimulation by having smart peers to talk to. They also say your brain will work better if you exercise and get a good night's sleep. Are you serious? This is your advice? Could this be any more obvious? The course is filled with obvious statements like this making it much longer than it needs to be. Seriously, it could be cut in half if not by two thirds. They also tell you the names of different chemicals in your brain. How this helps you learn better I don't know. There are a few good pieces of advice here and there. It's a shame you have to listen to so many lectures to hear them. They could have cut out the obvious stuff and got to the point much quicker."
2019-03-11,Keenan L,5.0,121.0,"I often tell others that the greatest lesson I learned by going to college was ""learning how I learn best."" And yet, when I reflect on my undergraduate career (I graduated in 2012), it occurs to me that I didn't truly reach my potential as a learner. The flawed learning techniques I gleaned in high school stayed with me for my college years -- I crammed nightly before exams; I took cursory looks at a homework set's answer key and convinced myself that I knew the topic; rather than admit to myself that I was letting procrastination get control over my life, I convinced myself that, ""I work well under a little pressure,"" or that I simply didn't ""have time to go to review sessions/attend office hours/review my work/etc."" I may have been able to graduate with decent grades, but I certainly couldn't recall from memory the majority of the work I did.
And so, I've been left feeling like I've failed myself; like I didn't truly achieve my potential as a learner. ""Who would I be today,"" I sometimes muse, ""if only I applied myself and gave learning my all?"" But I can't play the ""woe is me"" game anymore. I may have not taken advantage of the learning opportunities I had at the time, but I can certainly do better for myself going forward.
Taking Dr. Oakley's course, supplemented by reading her book, ""A Mind for Numbers"" has changed my life. It's altered my perspective about learning and memory, and it's given me insight into how brains learn best, and how I can maximize my success and efficiency when it comes to learning. 
To give you an idea of the impact of Dr. Oakley's insight on my life: I originally borrowed her book ""A Mind for Numbers"" from my local library; when I finished it, I immediately bought a copy for my personal collection -- in part, to have on hand, should my friends and family ask to read it; but more importantly, I bought the book to serve as a reference for myself in the years to come, when I may need to remind myself on the best tips and methods for learning. 
This course taught me how to learn, something I took for granted during my formative educational years. I can't wait to see where I end up in the future, now that I'm armed with the tools, techniques, and resources I need to succeed!"
2016-04-29,Oshan,5.0,91.0,"Great course. Took it since it was the most popular MOOC on coursera,. Have started using a few of the techniques and they are very effective. Highly recommended no matter who you are and what you do. "
2018-10-19,Antonello C,1.0,88.0,"Extremely boring and it doesn't provide anything really practical. All the concepts(that are really basic) could fit in 10 or 15 A4 pages, instead they wasted my time with an enormous amount of videos with no real reason. A waste of time. I can't understand why this course is surrounded by such a hype as the one it gets. A waste of time. "

2017-08-17,Amit K,5.0,43.0,It was a wonderful journey of learning how to learn. Simple and effective. Wish i had come across something like this a little early in life. But better late than never. Keep up the good work. Thanks.
2016-05-19,Esteban B,5.0,41.0,I found this course incredibly useful and practical. It has not only helped me better understand the process of learning but it has also given me valuable tools in how to optimize my learning process.
2016-09-09,Greeshma M R,5.0,39.0,"This is a course which I enjoyed. It gave a good insight of the learning methodologies which we have often heard of but not given due importance. Also, the brain facts is cool :) My 5/5 to this course"
2017-08-14,Juan S D l S,5.0,38.0,I really appreciate the time these guys invested in this course and am willing to take it again if they re-explain some topics in order to refresh some things that with time haven't stayed in my mind.
2019-09-23,Jonathan F,1.0,36.0,"not good. i didn't learn anything, it was boring and quite frankly if you don't know how to learn already, a free course is not going to help, you need a professional.  this course is bad."
2018-04-30,Pedro M N C,2.0,35.0,"Good teachers but... frankly the videos look outdated, very basic and talk a lot about concepts but nothing about how to apply what is supposed to elarn. It would be interesting to see someone studying and learning by applying what is stated above.
I frankly don't understand all the hype around this course, found it boring."
2019-03-23,Yağız K S,5.0,34.0,"This course was the first one I took in Coursera, and I'm glad to have been a part of it. Both Barbara and Terry are great teachers whose videos were a delight to listen to. They have given me tons of tricks to apply while studying and I have no doubt that these will come in handy. Thank you!"
2019-03-24,DHARINI U,5.0,33.0,"This is an amazing course. The design, flow and videos help gain understanding of the content in a seamless manner. The learning is highly engaging because of the simplicity of concept and the clarity of ideas provided right from the beginning of the course. Regular assessments and options to study additional content makes the learning more fun and exciting. The best part of this course is that one can apply the learnings of this course to anything and everything that you are learning or wish to learn. This is must do course for anyone who wants to keep learning in this journey of life"
2017-10-23,Jared R,5.0,31.0,This Course Is awesome it gave me a new look on how my brain works and that i should actually take breaks which is probably why i get frustrated. I am Excited to Put what i have learned into practice. 
2019-05-06,Пиндак С И,5.0,30.0,"Довольно хороший курс, усвоил для себя множество интересных техник, таких как помодоро и фокусировка на процессе обучения, а не результате для первичного снятия напряжения. Также понравились некоторые интервью, а некоторые не очень. Предлагаю подумать над интервью с людьми, которые могут поделиться своим практическим способом, но, к сожалению, не все интервью были такими."
2016-11-06,Bahaa A,5.0,28.0,"Amazing course, I learned a lot of new techniques for self motivation, and effecient learning. Now, I feel more confident to take further steps in improving and developing myself. Thank you so much :)"
2020-05-23 00:00:00,Pei F L,5.0,19.0,This course provides soft skills needed for continuous improvements which enhance my learning capabilities. It covers conceptual and practical approach to learn effectively and efficiently. Thank you! 
2020-05-18 00:00:00,Linda B,5.0,17.0,This class really focused on the process of learning.  It taught me so much.  I even shared ideas with my college and high school student.  They were surprised as some concepts were helpful to them also.
2018-03-14 00:00:00,Robert B,5.0,17.0,this course is great!  I actually already know some of these Technics and concepts before i went into this course but this course did such a great job of explaining it the now it really sticks with me.
2020-01-28 00:00:00,Anastasiia P,1.0,17.0,"I have finished the course, but I can't understand why everyone is giving such a high rating. Each and every advice in this course can easily fit in one 5 mins video and honestly I have learned far more simply by looking for learning techniques on youtube several years ago (I think now you can find even more information!). I thought in this course I could learn something new and interesting, but it was beyond measurement boring. I came to a point where I just made the quiz without looking the video or reading the text, because it is pretty obvious what the right answer is and you do not need to bore yourself with time-wasting videos or texts.
 To sum things from this course up: everyone can learn better through avoiding procrastination, focusing for short period of time, rewarding yourself for good results and doing basic stuff like training and good sleep. Here you go, the whole course content in one sentence!
Save your time and certificate money (! I really don't know who would pay for such a crap!), it does not worthy to waste your resources on this course!"
2015-11-14 00:00:00,Barry H,5.0,15.0,I found this course to be incredibly helpful. I am 33 and wish that I would have been taught a more efficient way of learning many years ago. There are definitely some great takeaways from this class.
2020-08-02 00:00:00,Constantine D,5.0,14.0,"This course accumulates a clear and valuable set of thoughts that structure knowledge about learning principles and tactics. Also, it was interesting to know some new things about how the brain works."
2019-09-17 00:00:00,Reham  H,5.0,13.0,"I loved it very much , it helped me in improving my skills and trying to find my passion by learning and have a great energy to do great things , it  is my pleasure to have this course from you doctors"
2017-07-20 00:00:00,Gaurav A,5.0,13.0,Really useful insights had been provided by this course. No price can be put on this valuable resource. It's beyond anything valuable. Thank you very much for making this course. God Bless Everyone :)
2018-09-25 00:00:00,Diogo C,2.0,9.0,"  In general, the course is very superficial. There are only a handful of useful ideas for learning in general (physical exercise, pomodoro for battling procrastination, analogies, interleaved testing and recall, spaced repetition) that can probably be taken from one of the teachers' TED talk.Another negative for me is that the focus is clearly for high-school students or early college. The final section, especially, is simply about passing exams. It never questions whether exams are actually effective or relevant to learning. Finally, there is the testing in the course. It goes against most of the ideas they taught. All of the questions are multiple-answer, often repeating the videos word for word, relying on superficial cues to finding the correct answer rather than actually knowing the material. The questions are also in the same order that they appear in the videos, which is exactly what they've advised not to do in the videos. Many of the possible answers are also obviously wrong, making it extremely easy to distinguish between the correct answers based on irrelevant information.It's not a completely worthless course, but it should be taken as a very small start, in my opinion. The extra materials (interviews especially) are good, at least giving people paths to follow depending on their specific interests.  "
2021-08-26 00:00:00,Werner V,5.0,8.0,"W​hile following this course I had fun and I started to enjoy again to learn in a properly/right way. It can be fun and playful. Thanks a lot for this course Prof. Oakley, Prof. Sejnowski and Coursera! "
2015-11-20 00:00:00,Nicholas D,1.0,8.0,"
This course tells you to use a timer while studying without the TV on and to avoid procrastination. It also stresses review while learning. This isn't anything new. The course discusses diffuse and focused modes. Diffuse modes are described as being as important as focused modes.  Running, day dreaming and sleep can help enter diffuse modes and integrate focused learning. Save you time and skip this course.  "
2016-09-26 00:00:00,Wesley S,1.0,8.0,Filled with redundant balderdash and extremely dumbed-down and slow-paced. Offends the learner.
2021-05-31 00:00:00,Nether S,5.0,7.0,"This course helped me a lot on realizing what I was missing and the real mistake that I've ever made. By fixing my cognition in learning, it gave me a better chance to study and retain more than ever."

2017-04-19 00:00:00,Matt M,1.0,6.0,"To be honest, there are no techniques here that cannot be found in many other places. The only difference is that they explain the science behind the techniques, which in terms of practical application is not very useful at all. "
2017-05-29 00:00:00,Catherine A,1.0,6.0,"It over simplifies everything... The only thing that is remotely difficult is reading the quiz, not because the questions are hard but because they have been written poorly."

It is very good for you to start your work in a very early time! BUT it is so rude to send emails/notifications/greetings/reminders to me in a very early/late time (e.g.,  7AM, 10PM). During that moment, I was waked up frequently by your emails which do NOT include a big deal.

2 points to make it better (as per my POV): update it a bit with a new visuals (it feels like studying in the 90's with); the test Q/A's are sometimes too easy and even if you don't know the material you can easily guess (which might create an illusion of competence haha). "

I only had to take a look at the summary videos and could do all the 'exams' without any problems.

I had some chuckles with some of the wrong answers, but that is about all the positive feedback I can give. It also brings some joy that I can see that you really enjoy what you are doing.

I felt frustrated by not being able to retain information effectively and  ended up having the felling that I wasted the time studying something that weeks later I would have forgotten. However, after taking this wonderful and extremely useful course, I am aware that the problem was not my ability to learn or something related to my brain, but instead I realized I have not being using the right tools to enhance my learning process and achieve better results. Learning is the most important tool to develop mastery in any field. Unfortunately at school we are not though how to learn, and this course without a doubt provides a deep understanding of how our brains and memory works, and more importantly it provides several tools that are easily applicable in learning any subject increasing the changes to succeed. Thanks a lot Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski for sharing such a powerful knowledge and tools. "

 treat ""procrastination."" Through this course, I noticed that I have more time for study than I thought. It happened because I could tackle procrastination. Other topics - focus mode and defuse mode, self-testing, working memory and long-term memory- were all interesting and useful for me. Thank you!"
2016-09-22 00:00:00,Jake E P,3.0,3.0,"What was helpful to me was: the discussion on spaced repetition, which boosted my confidence in applications like Duolingo and Memrise, and helped me discover Anki. The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far. I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset. The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.
What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on. The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies. This is key. Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough."
2015-08-18 00:00:00,Masako S,3.0,3.0,"The contents were interesting. Presentation rather poor. The speeches seemd disorganized. I had to rely on transcrips: downloaded and edited. The comments are at times too casual. And other times too much special terminology. Most of times I understand what she was trying to say. But listening attentively was very difficult. 
Heavy americanism impedes understanding; especially when the student does not have familiarity with US pop culture. I had to check how a pinball machine works. Zombis and four-armed (impossible) octpus were obstacles. "

I have just finished this course, and I must say that curiosity led me to take the course. 'Learning how to learn... ' I said to myself how do you learn to learn? Having finished the course, I totally agree that everyone needs to 'learn how to learn' If it can be simplified for the young minds, the course should actually be taken in grade school, then I thinks a lot more students will make straight A's. (Just my thought), 
 
The saying goes 'who feel it knows it.' The experience and knowledge of the instructor's Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski coupled with the outline, presentation and video helps (if I may use the language of the course) in interleaving seemingly related and different ideas (using metaphors and analogies) through out this course. 
 
How many things we take for granted? - movements, seeing, hearing, even blinking etc. The enigmatic power of the brain to process so many details within minutes, the power of your thoughts to change your person. Concept mapping, chunking, Procrastination and the Pomodoro technique (this I think we all do without realising there is actually techniques it, cues to procrastination etc. 
 
There is just so much to learn in this short course than can be explained. 
 
I am one of those who used the opportunity of the lock-down, it has opened my eye and I am willing to take more courses. I have also introduced the course to some people young and old to recharge their Brains. 
 
It is difference from what I learnt in all my years through school, university and experience in life. 
 
'The taste is in the pudding' My curiosity is thoroughly satisfied, 
 
I deeply appreciate the instructors, Coursera and all the team members involved in making this course available online, Thank you"
2020-01-12 00:00:00,Rajesh K,5.0,2.0,"Truly incredible course. It was rewarding experience to learn how our brain works. It opens many doors in our life when we know how our brain works, at least we can understand why we have certain kind of feeling. As sometimes we can't understand why we have feeling of discomfort, but it is the brain's signal coming from the subconcious that you have messed up something and now you have to look up where you've goofed up and make it correct. What I have learned is that pain is incredibly powerful tool created by nature. I mean how can know if something bad happened to you if there's no pain(both physical and mental). It's a nature's way of grabing your attention to address that problem so now and next time you be careful and not repeat that mistake. Pain, anger and frustration are really powerful feelings that can do wonders in our life if you acknowledge their existence. It is the path towards the truth. Just like in one of the optional interview we've seen the pain of his grandmother's death due to Alzheimer motivated Nelson Dellis to become memory champion. This course is also helpful for the people who are dealing with Depression, Social Anxiety, PTSD, chronic fear and much more because when they are dealing with those problems it creates a lots of confusion as to why they have certain kind of feeling.
Internet is such an incredibly powerful tool if it is used smartly. I can't believe we have access to such a high quality material for free. Thank you Barbara Oakley ma'am, Terry Sejnowski sir, Coursera team and all the people who are associated with this course."

I have a bachelors and masters degree, recently got some more hard certifications (AWS cloud architect and developer) and needed a way to even learn more and more efficiently in the future both for work / career and personal life. 
iI want to learn davinci resolve video cutting, improve in photography, photoshop. lightroom. 

As mentioned, i have been working towards personal dvelopment for 13 years, read though about 50 books and 1000 pages of blog posts, but never retained much info - now i have the tools to retain that info, test myself on it, and use spaced repetition to retain it for a decade. Discuss it with my wife to even more deepen the knowledge. Use pomodoro and other techniques to really do my courses 100 percent and not loose interest after 10%.

Thanks Barbara and Terence for this great course which is a lifechanger for me even after i already gained so much knowledge in my past 38 years on this earth.

This course should be mandatory in every school education all of the world as it explains the PROCESS of learning and not just focused on the PRODUCT. I wish, i knew about this course when i was 15 or even 20 years only (now that i am 38). "
2022-01-01 00:00:00,Rashad M s,5.0,2.0,"This class really focused on the process of learning. It taught me so much. I even shared ideas with my college and high school student. They were surprised as some concepts were helpful to them also.

This course targets mostly students audience, but not people with the aim of self-development, who passed their academic study long time ago. Therefore, information concerning learning process somehow too much basic, but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts. What didn't also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing videos explaining different concepts of brain structure and functioning, that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course. But what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people. They were really motivating and inspiring!  "
2021-07-05 00:00:00,Shreya K,1.0,2.0,"Ableist language is unforgivable in a course designed to speak to learning ; 
Example 1 : ""adhd-like"", 
Example 2 : ""EVR had a high IQ and seemed normal, but he was ruined by making bad financial decisions and bad social interactions"". 
If you are autistic, have ADHD, or are neurodivergent in any way, this course will be more harmful than helpful. Your unique and beautiful way of thinking will not be aided in this space.
They also overly glamorize of math and science - I am a scientist and I still thought this was a poor choice. "
2020-06-20 00:00:00,Yevhen M,1.0,2.0,"The first chapter was pretty good. But everything else was just obvious things - check summaries and you will see. Learn, do breaks, sleep well, do sport, don't forget to repeat what've learnt. There are some interesting facts but they are not worth spent time. "
2020-05-04 00:00:00,Chayton C,1.0,2.0,"really slow videos with 0 detail, really weird questions after videos with answers such as ""a million billion"" idk what this is supposed to be"

2020-06-07 00:00:00,Elroy L B J,5.0,1.0,"I wish I had known this before entering College or University. Most of the content feels like common sense in a way that we all knew this and that were the steps that we had to take to learn better. However, this course reinforces the information so well with logic, explanation and passion such that now, there are no excuses I can make to deny that procrastination is something I can understand and avoid. Learning is certainly up to an individual's willpower to consciously plan your schedule, break down goals, stick to your goals, and most importantly, be consistent by taking a day-by-day approach. Never forget to look at the big picture; conversely, don't focus on the product. Enjoy and trust the process. Simply reading a new passage today can go a long way if you step back and realise how far you can go, or you have gone, just by completing 1 simple pomodoro today. Thank you Professors for the enjoyable learning experience. The first step I am taking is to reinforce my learning from this course onto my learning for my academics. Thank you Coursera for making this course free and accessible."
2021-01-23 00:00:00,Diego M,5.0,1.0,"The course a life-changing and a must! It took me It took me around 1 week and a half to complete it with an average work of 2 hours per day. As a 17-year-old student, residing in a developing country, the knowledge you get is gold, especially for this stage of life.  The lectures are effective, fun, and simple to understand. Barbara and Barb are also really kind and transmit much peace. The assignments are very easy if you pay attention to the videos, in this case, I would recommend that they were more challenging or creative to improve the experience. The additional resources are great for people who wanna deepen their knowledge. The information is based on solid, and professional research made by Ph.D. Professors and scientists from American Universities. What is most important, is that the knowledge you get is applicable for every educational area of your life, not only for academic purposes. I will be forever thankful to Barbara Oakley, Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, the LHTL Team, and Coursera for this opportunity. Greetings from Paraguay! "
2019-01-01 00:00:00,Sonja L,5.0,1.0,"  As a chronic procrastinator, I usually get work done in the most stressful way possible because I've never found the motivation to get past all the excuses I make for not starting earlier, even after researching so many study techniques and hacks. This course has been amazing in explaining the reasons that commonly praised techniques work in terms of how our brain actually functions. For example, I have heard that revising at longer intervals will help you remember more information. In contrast, Barbara Oakley explains that spaced repetition will consolidate information from your short-term memory into your long-term memory, as the information won't be considered unimportant and erased from your neural networks. Knowing why these techniques work really motivates me to actually use them.I learnt so many new approaches to studying and life in general in LHTL. I highly recommend it as a way to boost productivity, minimise stress and feel better about the process of studying as something to look forward to, now that there's a framework behind it!  "
2020-09-05 00:00:00,Camille C,5.0,1.0,"I’m an almost 60 year old lifetime learner, & even though I am a Psychology honor student , I had never fully connected the dots,  so to speak , on how each person’s brain is wired similarly- yet still retains it own unique characteristics/ abilities . 
Even thoughI i have a background from my college major studies, I still discovered that ones. own  Internal / mental  attitudes , beliefs, can play a role in helping improve a individual’s learning! 
I very enthusiastically recommend this course , both as a “ stand alone” self improvement genre of course, as well as the whole series of courses which build upon one another that are offered through this application, Coursera.
I throughly enjoyed both of the Professors, the guest speakers in some of the videos, & especially the format in which it was delivered.
The whole course was a joy from beginning to end; & I now have extra “ tools” for my “ toolbox” to apply toward all future learning throughout the remainder of my learning lifetime ! 
Time and money well spent to receive the certificate !!"
2020-05-30 00:00:00,M H,5.0,1.0,"  Great course, effective and efficient. They got good sources from various optional interviews which can help learners get an insight into others perspectives and experiences. The course videos themselves would not exceed a 10 minute duration making them easier to watch as nobody is really worried about the lack of time they have. The quizzes are effective and straightforward and don't really get you frustrated as some quizzes usually do. The course itself was a fun experience and can be done in a short time period, even though it says 4 week duration on the course one can even possibly finish it in 4-5 days. I myself finished the course before the four week deadline. The fact that it is a self-paced course not only benefits you as you don't have to stress about any course deadlines, timings, etc. it also helps you to manage yourself and your time in a more effective manner and it's a good way to keep yourself busy whenever you have nothing else going on. It's also a good way to learn something if you have a general thirst for knowledge.  "
2019-09-16 00:00:00,Gabriel G,5.0,1.0," This course is truly life-changing. I took it in order to solidify my studying habits.  I started Engineering recently, and since it's (in Canadian schools)  quite a math-intensive and very rigorous program, Learning how to Learn  seemed like a must-do while I'm not neck-deep in exams and homework.   As a current student, and as a learner, this course is definitely  something that anyone should do if they want to improve their long-term  memory and reduce their time spent on studying to assimilate the same  amount of information.   In my honest opinion, one of the best parts of this course is that you  can easily follow it while on transit. For my part, I would download a  week's lessons at a time and listen to them while walking to the bus and  while riding it. Of course, I missed some information by not using my  focused attention so much, but I had time to do my homework at home and  learn how to learn elsewhere.  Thank you so much for building this incredible course. Thank you even more for making it free.  TL;DR: Take the course.  "
2019-03-24 00:00:00,Hongmei L,5.0,1.0,"I decided to take several online courses to help advance my career, and all of them are new subjects to me.  When I was at school, I had no problem passing all the tests needed, but I don't feel I retained the knowledge as well as some of my classmates did after the semester (and all the tests) was (were) over.  Nowadays in real life, there are projects to be completed and I kept on procrastinating to the last minute.  It's rather stressful to handle work responsibilities this way.  I am grateful that this course provides many practical techniques that I can utilize in my daily work and my self-learning plans, from how to avoid procrastination, how to retain more from what is learned, to how to make weekly/daily learning plans.  Highly recommended to anyone who is serious about learning and is looking for strategies to learn effectively. "
2020-06-09 00:00:00,Nikita K,5.0,1.0,"Прекрасный курс! 
Мой фидбэк будет покрывать не только данный курс, но еще и книгу A Mind for Numbers, т.к. я читал ее параллельно курсу. 
Данный курс помог мне понять и освоить многие вещи, связанные с процессом обучения в целом. Проходя его ты узнаешь как работает память, зачем надо хорошо высыпаться за день до экзамена, почему групповая работа важна и как быстро выводить себя из состояния прокрастинации. Здесь так же стоит сказать, что сам курс довольно хорошо освещает все эти темы и многое другое, но все видео довольно коротенькие, и сама информация подается в сжатом виде. В этот момент на помощь приходить книга Думай как Математик. И она вовсе не про математику. Эта книга - как детальный путеводитель, дополняющий курс и помогающий осваивать некоторые из техник, предлагаемые за время курса. "
2020-12-11 00:00:00,vijay,5.0,1.0,"I spent hours of study but not able to recollect most of topics before taking this course. Now, i started applying the learnning techniques discussed in this course such as Foucsed mode, Diffused mode thourgh  pomodora technique, deliberate practice, spaced learning as of now. Even I started pomodoro technique in my office work. It has already produced great results by completing the tasks on time. Further, I have realized the importance of task lists my superior does always and in some way i am also implementing for all my work activities and the task list is a great way to free the working memory and prioritozing the imporatant works. Thanks Coursera for providing this wonderful course and offering free of cost."
2019-01-19 00:00:00,tio w,5.0,1.0,"As someone who has taken ""the science of everyday thinking"" on EDX, I thought there'd be no online courses that are as insightful, transformative, and broadly applicable in life as it is until I discovered ""Learning how to learn"" on Coursera. Although both share some similar advice and tips, LHTL has a much more in-depth look at human brains' way of absorbing and processing information from a neuroscientific point of view. Not to mention that both instructors are highly respected and excellent at presenting knowledge throughout the whole course. I genuinely hope that this course can reach more and more people trying to lead a more productive and meaningful life."
2020-06-03 00:00:00,Anna S,5.0,1.0,"This course provides excellent strategies to improve memory when learning and to increase understanding without spending hours studying material.  In addition, the course instructors do not waffle - they get to the point fast and so, this course does not feel heavy or boring to learn, but a large amount of valuable material IS covered!  There are a tonne of eclectic resources provided and learners can go as deep as they want into improving or developing their own learning techniques with guidance from this course.  I highly recommend this for educators as well as learners."
2020-02-09 00:00:00,Valentin L,5.0,1.0,"A very comprehensive course on the subject of learning. I have used the research-backed methods taught in this course to improve my learning and not only did I gain a better understanding of the material I was studying but as an adult/lifelong learner, I use the techniques in this course to retain a lot more of my daily reading on various subjects. 
I also strongly recommend (to everyone not just Math/Science majors) reading Dr. Barbara Oakley's  ""A Mind for Numbers"" - which is a very useful complementary text for the course.

It is a course that I recommend for people of all ages, as we are constantly learning throughout life. But I recommend it above all to parents, as this way they can guide their children much better in the learning process.

I would have loved to know this material long before, but it's never too late :) I learned a lot,

Thank you!"
2020-06-03 00:00:00,Swan L,5.0,1.0,"Thank you for this course. I've been out of the structured learning environment for a while now, and this course not only instilled some good learning habits (anybody can do one or two Pomodoro), knowing the why behind these habits helped. So now, when my brain gets foggy, I step away from my books / computer and go do something else that allows me to switch my brain to a different mode. "
2019-01-27 00:00:00,Tatsiana S,5.0,1.0,This course is really beneficial! I am so amazed that every statement here is based on proven scientific facts.

It is really the first course on Coursera I have completed. I appreciate authors amazing work and look forward to Part II.

2020-07-21 00:00:00,Ian P,4.0,1.0,"I have taken more than two dozen online courses in a wide range of subject. This is an excellent course filled with universal practical skills and insights to make the most of your own learning potential in any subject or discipline. Just as useful are the tools and tips provided to overcome the most prevalent bad habits and ingrained behavior that impede learning. 
The material is presented primarily through short video lectures (less than 10 minutes) in plain spoken English accessible to high school students yet useful to scholars and life-long learners at any age or level. The lectures are supported with abundant supplemental optional videos from learning experts and scholars along with reading from popular articles and professional literature. The lectures are comprehensively documented with references. My only regret is that I didn't learn what is taught here very early in my academic career.  "

2015-08-31 00:00:00,Emil M,3.0,1.0,"There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself). Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one. On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesn't mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test. Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and ""chunked"" into real knowledge.
So, a better name for this course would be ""Learning how to learn academically"". As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge. Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge."

А, и самое в этом весёленькое: рекомендация «Сфокусируйтесь!» Да если б у меня не было проблем с концентрацией, нужен был бы мне курс о том как учиться?!

Ещё одна чудесная вишенка — интервью с разными персонажами. Да на кой ляд мне рассказ старушки о том, как ей помог этот курс, если курс ниочём? И это, как насчёт неприкрытого манипулирования и навязывания студентам ошибки выжевшего? Очень, блин, научно. "

I appreciated the new perspectives on learning, and the smaller chunks of video and assignments (which allowed me to spread the work out over the week).
The ""Thanks for Learning about Learning"" phrase was fine for the course introduction and the final module, but became annoying as the closing phrase. of. every. video.
Dr Sejnowski's skills are reading a teleprompter distracted me - I suggest doing some practice and redoing the videos when the TP won't be such a distraction (watching his eyes track back and forth didn't do it for me).

2019-06-17 00:00:00,M,2.0,1.0,"Based on the reviews I read, my expectations for this course were pretty high. However, the course ended up being very basic and I didn't learn any new learning technique. I think that for most people who have Googled study methods at least once, they will already be familiar with most (if not all) of the methods introduced in the course. The material may be useful for someone totally new to studying, but even then I would not recommend taking it. You can learn just as much is less time watching YouTube videos or reading brief guides on procrastination and learning techniques. 
The quality of the course was also disappointing. The volume in each video jumped up and down across lessons or when different speakers took the lead. I am surprised to see there's so much hype around this course despite its simplistic content and poor quality. I've taken more than a dozen courses at Coursera so far and this one doesn't even come close to the best ones I took.
I'd recommend finding something better to invest your time on."

2015-09-12 00:00:00,Chris O,5.0,0.0,"I broke every rule of efficient and effective learning until I met this course, Dr. Barbara Oakley Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, and the book: “A Mind for Numbers”. 
I wish I had met your group and this powerful vehicle of learning earlier –university wouldn’t have been so costly (studying the inefficient way) and the rewards could be even more phenomenal with this awareness. Nevertheless, your incredible work will continue to help mitigate the cost.
Although I maintained good grades through university primarily because of my high enthusiasm, interest and determination to achieve excellence in life–long learning, but the personal cost was undue stress –over studying, keeping many late nights, dependency on caffeine and life-work-family balance. However, I imagined there had to be a better way.
The frustrations and occasionally being at my wits end in solving some of the problems in the computer programming languages I am currently learning have instantly dissipated because of this course. I have completely changed my old and inefficient learning methods and formed new habits for learning.
Amazingly, I failed to solve the triangle problem on the first try at the end of a long day of work and study (after staring at it for about 45mins) in the book: “A Mind For Numbers” by Dr. Barbara Oakley. However, determined, I gave it another shot the next morning, right after waking up -it took me less than 30 seconds to solve. You’ve got to love the diffuse mode…
While I love academia and stand ready to dance with whatever pain it dishes out at me in my life-long learning journey, this course has single-handedly removed current and whatever inherent or perceived pain that may be associated with life-long academic learning for me. 
There is a better way to rote learning method -a different, efficient and effective approach… Academic goal or any subject matter no longer need to take many years of painful endurance to achieve or master.
This course has armed me with the ultimate set of tools to expertly construct efficient and effective learning methods with measureable success. Essentially, I have learned how to hack my academic growth and goal.
Finally, in the past, I stumbled upon one or two of the methods taught in this course in academic journals and other articles. However, these occasional, inconsistent and isolated pieces of information were not cohesive to form a powerful enough force to help build a fundamental understanding and practice of efficient learning methods. Additionally, overpowering the well-formed habit of the inefficient rote learning method was a challenge. 
Fortunately, this course and the book: “A Mind For Numbers” by Dr. Barbara Oakley, compiled and put all of these scientific data on efficient learning methods in to proper perspective, easy enough for anyone to understand and practice. 
In the afterword chapter of the book, Dr. David B. Daniel said it best:
“There has long been a stream of potentially productive study advice coming from scientists. Unfortunately, it has seldom been translated so the average student can easily grasp and use it. Not every scientist has a knack for translation, and not every writer has a firm grasp of the science. In this book, Barbara Oakley threaded this needle beautifully. Her use of vivid examples and explanations of the strategies reveals not only how useful but how credible these ideas are.”
Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and the Learning How to Learn Team for a job well done! Your work is indelible in my mind and I can be certain, in others too.
"
2019-08-24 00:00:00,Ali A P B,5.0,0.0,"This is the
first real elaborated review I´ve done in my life. That´s the kind of impact
this course can produce. I felt like I wanted to express my opinion about it
and my gratitude. If you are someone who likes learning or teaching, or need to
perform those activities in your everyday life for any reason, then you should
take this course without hesitation. The information given is so valuable and
eye opening. I personally like to read a lot and gain new knowledge about
anything, but I always had that little feeling that I was not being truly
efficient in doing it, that I was doing something wrong or, going further, that
I wasn´t capable or smart enough to retain the information I was trying to
learn, because I usually found myself investing a lot of time reading over and
over again a material to realize, weeks later, that I had forgotten almost all
of it. That, of course, caused me a lot of frustration. I used to feel that I
was wasting my time. I knew that the best way to learn something was trough
practice, but this course helped me understand how the process of learning
really works, the correct way of practicing and the mistakes people usually
make (illusions of learning).
I had read years
ago a book about memory and memorization (Una Mente Prodigiosa by Ramón
Campayo), originally written in spanish (I´m a native spanish speaker), which
gave me a lot of insights and tools for memorizing better, but I never applied
it to my learning process. This course has filled the gap between memorizing
and learning, the missing piece that I needed to complete the puzzle. The tools
mentioned in that book are also mentioned here, but joined together with the
process of learning subjects completely, with understanding, creativity,
flexibility, associations and long term memorization.
I have used the
tools given in this course to learn and memorize the course itself, and they
have been truly effective. I have also used them in studying in my own area of
work, which is mechanical engineering, and also have proven to be quite useful.
I now feel that the information stay in my mind for longer, which helps to
understand new and more complex concepts better. Of course, memorizing is not
learning, real learning comprises a lot of other things, but it´s a very
important part of the learning process. If you can´t remember the material,
then you can´t use the information to solve anything, to learn new things or to
use the information creatively. 
I also play the
piano, and I have even used some of the information while practicing and
learning new songs. This demonstrates that the concepts of the course can be
used in any field, as long as you´re learning something.
Another
important and pleasant aspect of this course, is the way Dr. Barbara Oakley
presents the material. She is so kind and friendly, which gives you the
sensation that you are listening to a close friend or someone that you´ve known
for a long time. That makes the course material more accessible and enjoyable.
Dr. Terry Sejnowski also does a very good job at teaching. They´re just so easy
to hear. The material is very clear and well organized.
I will say like
Dr. Barbara says very often: I can´t thank you both enough for this course. I´m
really grateful. Learning is a lifelong process, and that´s where the
importance of this course lies."
2020-09-21 00:00:00,L K,5.0,0.0,"I thought this was an absolutely great course and I am so glad I took it. 
For me, multiple choice tests, problem sets and expository rather than analytic term papers were the norm. 
These examination procedures are relatively objective ways to evaluate learning. 
In addition, as US students, we were sometimes also expected to make oral presentations. By the way, the oral presentations of Oakley and Sejnowski were superb. When I asked my English students to come to class with an oral presentation, they addressed whatever objections or fears that they may have had, by not coming class on the day given -  they knew their grade was based solely on one essay written at home and one essay written under exam conditions. 
Anyway, from having studied and taught in England, my experience has been that multiple choice tests are derided, and hardly used at all for more advanced students. Being able to write an essay about something is valued or evaluated. I have taught courses where there was an essay for the exam and an essay for the term project, and that was it.  To me, essays are certainly useful, and I wish that I was better at writing them myself. The drawbacks are at least two. 1) Valuing essays alone tends to favor those who can make something sound good rather than those who might have a superior understanding of a subject. This has a less than salutary effect on political discourse, among other things, not that we are doing better in the US at the moment. It favours those who sound clever rather than those who actually are clever. 2) It means that students can sometimes strategize - they may know they only have to answer 2 essay questions about two subjects out of  five subjects for example, so they may not bother to learn 3/5 of the material, and there is no way to tell whether they have as much knowledge about the other subjects as about the one they wrote about in their essay.
""The Learning How to Learn"" Coursera course would help any student to understand the material that they would have to write about either quickly or in a more considered way, but it leaves out the whole question (nearly) of how to get better at writing about what you have learned. This is not exactly a criticism of the course. You are likely to have heard of this tendency to value essay writing above all else in the British system. That ""Learning"" means different things in different places is hardly an earth-shaking conclusion but I thought I would mention it.
Thank you very much for the course. It was completely fantastic and I am so glad that a friend recommended it to me."
2016-03-13 00:00:00,Mark V,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course.  The concepts and techniques taught here should be required by every teacher and student in our school systems from kindergarten on.  Of course, some of the material is well beyond the grasp of a kindergartner, but the techniques and methods can be taught by how their teacher manages the delivery of curriculum.   It is never too early to teach our children how to learn.
This is a wonderfully succinct presentation of key concepts that I wish had been available to me in my youth.   I was very fortunate to have an anatomy and physiology professor in college in 1979 that took time in his lectures to teach about how the brain learns and some methods and principles for study, retention, and recall.   I saw many of his concepts in this course.
I later went on to teach college myself.   I found the students in my Freshman course on data communications were particularly lazy about making an effort to learn material thoroughly.   I knew this bad habit would hinder their progress in the semesters to come.
I adopted a practice of making my mid-term exam a thorough (not to be confused with level of difficulty) test of their understanding.  Consequently, 60% would fail that test.   When delivering the bad news I also delivered a path to recovering from that score.   I provide several hours of lecture on what I learned about learning from my A&P professor.   Then I offered a retest.   The questions were posed differently in wording and type (multiple choice vs short answer essay vs T/F).  Everyone improved their score significantly and the pass/fail distribution reflected more of a bell curve distribution.
Interestingly, when I tried teach how to learn before the mid-term I still saw a 60% failure rates.   I expect somethings require more motivation.   The risk of failing a course proved to be motivating, so I capitalized on that human behavior.   I wish I could have found a better way, because this approach cost several lecture hours of data communications instruction.   However, teaching them to learn proved so much more valuable.
I, unexpectedly had the same high failure rate on a term test teach an Algebra class.   I responded in kind with lectures on how to learn.   On student that started with failing the first term test almost dropped.   Another student that had taken other classes encouraged her stay on and to learn how to learn.   She finish Algebra with an A-.   At the end of the course she came to me with the most treasured compliment of my teach career, ""You taught me that I can learn anything I want to learn."""
2018-06-27 00:00:00,Deleted A,5.0,0.0,"Hello!“Learning how to learn” at first might seem quite absurd.But I assure you that this would be by far the most quintessential course you have ever taken.The course itself is taken by Terry Sejnowski (Professor at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies) and Barbara Oakley, (Ph.D., PE is a Professor of Engineering at Oakland University.)Where she explains, How by considering herself as the “belligerent queen in math” she flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation.But it was when she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options :Both to rise in the military and to explore other careers.She returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.In “Learning how to learn”, Dr. Oakley and Terry Sejnowski lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science ( or any field in particular) secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. In the course many important topics likeProcrastination, Chunking, the difference between Long-term and short-term memory and Focused and diffused modes are taken up and discussed in depths (step by step).Moreover many small topics like Test taking, Teamwork, Spaced repetition and Memory retention techniques (including memory palace, usage of analogy and visual representation) are also included which is quite unconventional but extremely helpful especially for students and learners learning a new language.Plus the small Finger exercises and Peer-graded Assignments with a grading percentage criteria always helps students to strive for the “best. Hence, whether by introducing the idea of Zombie mode and other sophisticated processes like Einstellung, Deliberate practice and Transfer idea all by taking examples of great personalities like : Thomas Edison, Santiago Ramón y Cajal and, Salvador Dali, or by providing optional interviews and redings from one of the renowned scholars : Dr. Robert Bilder, Keith Devlin, Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent never failed to enthuse our interest in a particular topic and always encouraged us to achieve our highest creative potential.Thank you !"

Realizing the
Capabilities to Learn is My Biggest Motivation
Before starting this MOOC, I was very nervous and anxious
about the materials I needed, the type of information I will learn, and how
successful I’d be at completing this course. There was also some skepticism on
whether or not this course would actually teach me anything useful in my
journey for higher education. It took me a week to commence studies, but I
quickly became engaged after introductions from Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr.
Terrence Sejnowski. I believe it was their own nervousness that gave me comfort
in the beginning, and then watching them transform with a higher sense of
confidence allowed me to trust their discourse.
After the first two weeks, I had the opportunity to speak
creatively during Sunday dinners with family on some of the scientific factors
involved with Learn2Learn. I was surprised at how much of the information I was
able to recall and how it led to us reminiscing about past experiences we
thought were long forgotten. I’ve definitely changed my perspective or thought
process on a lot of events, circumstances, and choices discussed with family,
which leads me to have a better understanding of Dr. Sejnowski’s lecture on
memory consolidation.
Now that my confidence level has experienced a significant
boost, it motivated me to take on a second MOOC. This could not be possible
without the information I’ve obtained from “Learning How to Learn.” I had given
up on myself and didn’t think I was mentally ready or capable of successfully
completing college-level course work. I was wrong! After applying several of
the techniques captured from this course, I am motivated to move forward with
my educational goals, and will only look back to remember the skills I
developed from this MOOC.
 Thank You Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for your inspiration."
2017-07-28 00:00:00,Abhishek M,5.0,0.0,"This course is like one of those nostalgic memories, which
force us to desire foresight. Generally speaking though the course is helpful
for everybody, but it will be a boon for many students. Many techniques and
scenarios discussed in the course will definitely help both during learning
phase and also during revision as well as in tests. 
The course rightly points out many blunders that students
commit due to bad habits acquired through students life. The bad habits I am
talking about is about learning only and not of ethical values!! For e.g.
practicing easy questions enough or first thing and not focusing on hard
questions and many more like them. 
So for me the course has:
PROS:
1. A very short duration of course.
2. Easy teaching style of Prof. Oakely combined with
relevant examples. 
3. Synthesis of various learning techniques, so that week by
week students gain a better understating of learning process.
4. Easy and simple steps to follow to see improvement.
5. Interviews with relevant figures to give a flavor
different and at the same time similar thinking process across the successful.
6. The course is free.
 
CONS:
1. The second instructor Dr. Sejnowski is very knowledgeable
and have a firm grasp of the material, but the things that he taught could be
trimmed by 60% easily and it still will not take away anything relevant from
the course. Dr. Sejnowski also didn’t feel comfortable talking or explaining in
the front of the camera so his videos appeared to be forced.
2. Most of the quiz question were taken verbatim from the
transcript. As this course is about creativity that part could have been
avoided to inculcate depper understanding of the subject. 
But in the end, I profited handsomely from this course. 
Thank you Prof. B. Oakley, Dr T Sejnowski and their entire team. "

I have been introduced to the world of wonderful opportunities to gain knowledge for free and in as comfortable environment as possible qute recently by a lovely russian-speaking YouTuber- Anastacia Kay (a link to her video on courseral:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGR5yJn-GZo) and I`ve been learning here ever since. Thanks to Nastya and Coursera! And to his particular course, which has made me a much better student, I believe. For now I know why I couldnot remember things well, though I`ve spent a lot of time studying. =) And now I have a deeper understandying of some of my earlier experiences (for instance, I`ve read a fictional book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child 'the reliquary' (detective-story & horrors -lovers might like it) and the main character used such a mental technique as 'Mental Palace'. I now know hot to use it too). + Some ideas from a great book (though its author could have argued with me on the title 'great' I gave and will continue giving it) ""How to read a book"" by Mortimer Adler, the ideas from the book and the course also matched and explained one another. 
Plus I would say, that this course workes best together with another insightful Coursera course ""Neurobiology of everyday life"". They provide a look on somewhat the same topics, giving different perspectives to it! 
All in all, I am really greateful to the creators of the course and the site! You help people learn about the world arround us with wonder and without limitations (financial, locational, health...)! Thank you! "
2021-07-14 00:00:00,Matthew M,5.0,0.0,"I started this course because I'm interested in becoming a Software Developer and started following a curriculum created by Developers called ""The Odin Project."" In the curriculum of The Odin Project, it's recommended that the ""Learning How to Learn"" course be enrolled in to learn the most efficient ways to learn so that your ability to understand the vast concepts necessary to be a successful Software Developer are less daunting and actually achievable. At least, that's how I understood what I was enrolling myself into.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn many new things about myself, my own processes of learning, (and how I've been holding myself back from doing so efficiently) and to learn that I most certainly am not alone in the world of academics. We all have things we procrastinate on doing, but sometimes it's easy to forget that when you're swimming in your own sea of craziness.

After completing this course, I feel that I understand how the brain processes learning new information, and how best I can retain that information for the future, in addition to being able to interleave my learning so it's useful to me across many different things in life, not just the thing(s) I'm trying to learn now. I also now have a better understanding of procrastination and the things I can do to help conquer it.

There's a lot more in this course, and I highly recommend it to everyone. Any person that wants to truly learn and educate themselves, not waste time doing things inefficiently, and accomplish their goals should take this course. This course can not only help you achieve your learning goals, but it can help you with your everyday life and how you process information.

Best of luck with learning how to learn everyone!

2022-02-04 00:00:00,"IGENOZA, N O",5.0,0.0,"Against popular opinion, learning is an art that is learned with guidelines the same way we learn various skills such as programming, driving, tailoring. It is one of the most complex phenomena considering the fact that everything else that is learned consciously or unconsciously is hinged on it. When I stumbled on the concept of “learning how to learn” on Cousera, I was more than excited to delve into it and see what it was all about. Indeed, the content  in the course has so far surpassed my expectations. Learning isn’t always fun, sometimes while learning you get stuck on ideas that you cannot seem to figure out. However, through persistence and observing simple learning rules it becomes worthwhile.
A very big thank you to Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for this amazing, explicit, detailed yet concise course. I have learned so much from you. I have gained clarity in some concepts that were hitherto confusing
Having listened to Benny Lewis on the subject of leaning languages in his interview with Barbara Oakley during the course of this lesson, my passion was re-ignited. He opined that the best way to learn a language is to speak without the fear of making mistakes, this is because paying so much attention to mistakes will inhibit the learning process and might dampen the learner’s interest. I have resolved that no matter what it takes, sooner than I had expected, I would begin to speak Spanish, the language of  my dreams fluently.
I would like to use this opportunity to reach out to anyone reading this who are bilingual in English and Spanish to help a friend. I want to speak it more often. It would be nice to Speak Español with you🤗.

Je dois juste dire que j'ai trouvé qu'il y a beaucoup à lire , chose qui est très intéressante mais j'avoue que je n'ai pas eu le temps de lire les extras ( lecture , vidéos , lien internet ) je ne sais pas s'il y a quelqu'un qui a réussi à le faire pendant le cours ? je serais très intéressée de savoir comment la personne a procédé pour le faire ? ou Si les enseignants pourront nous donner des astuces comment pouvoir tout lire ? est ce possible ?  pour ma part je vais le faire dans un deuxième temps et en utilisant la technique de ""pomodoro"" :-)  et ""recall"" pour bien me souvenir de l'essentiel et j'ai aussi beaucoup aimé le mode ""dufuse"" je l'adore et je crois en ce mode car je l'ai déjà essayé mais d'une manière spontanée et inconsciente maintenant je sais qu'il fait parti des stratégies d'apprentissage .

2015-12-21 00:00:00,Connie T K,5.0,0.0,"(+) Manageable bite-sized online lectures with interesting content that are highly relevant to the topic of Learning How to Learn
(+) Assessments are pitched at the right level, with questions requiring recall of the concepts learnt and some other comprehension- and application-typed questions that require a bit more thinking to apply the concepts learnt.
(+) Professor Oakley has a very interesting style of presenting the topic that makes the material very easy to digest and learn. She communicates key learning points in a concise and succinct manner using a variation of simple analogies, wacky (but meaningful) graphics, life stories and other examples to draw out or to associate to important lesson takeaways.
(+) Personally, I did not managed to finish all the optional interviews but I really appreciate the time and effort used to glean additional inputs and insights from multiple perspectives and I hope to be able to revisit this course at a later time.
(+) Professor Sejnowski's insights into learning how our brain works is something new to me. It is also an important part of this course. Although I could barely recall the terminologies, but certain images that he has shared to assist in scientific explanations, and the true accounts of HM as well as the two scientists who swollowed poison without being poisoned, did stay in me and helped me understand the material better.
Thank you, Professor Oakley and Sejnowski, the course was meaningful and well-paced, offering insights into learning and how the brain works. I greatly appreciate the effort and time spent to make the materials and information illustrative for learners."
2016-07-21 00:00:00,Ruth S C,5.0,0.0,"      This course, the professionalism of the teaching staff and the content impressed me to the extent I sent emails to every thinking person I know.  One of my students has done weeks one and two several times.... she is a grade 11 school student and an original thinker.  She is the only one that looked at the course and gave me feed back. 
     I am so grateful to be able to learn from great thinkers without feeling that I am one of the world's failures.  How very much I do appreciate not being talked down to and being given the time to write down words that I might not know well and, finding that as I learn meanings from an ordinary dictionary, I am able to use those words on a day to day basis.  I am also so grateful that I did not have to buy anything either from the University or from needing extra books to understand the course.

     I have changed several of my home tutoring practices.  In fact as it is school holidays here I have been practicing to 'teach' as well as the teachers on this course. 

    My nature is such that I need to thank people for the service they do to others.  I wish I could thank you by buying a million certificates. As I am unable to do this or even buy one - what I can do is acknowledge that I learned what I know from the University of California, San Diego and mention  the names of those who helped me learn.  The other way of saying thank you is to remind my thinking friends that if they wish to avoid loss of their abilities to think rationally, as they age ,  they could look at the courses available to everyone.

2017-10-16 00:00:00,Alex ,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course!  The material was presented in a clear, easy-to-remember fashion, with lots of memory devices to help remember (whodathunkit?) the material, not just the usual powerpoint slides.  The quiz after every video was low-stakes and I appreciated knowing up front that each quiz can be tried again, with the highest score kept.  This made it low-stakes and less stressful, and made me more likely to complete it on time.  The professors were cheerful and upbeat and made class a pleasure.  The material is all solidly researched, and I loved the optional interviews and extra reading material.  Much of the course information tied in with things I'd already read, like telling yourself a racing heart means you're excited, not afraid (I read that in The Upside of Stress, by Kelly McGonigle).  But even the things I knew or had tried were presented in a new context, in such a way I'm more likely to remember them in the future.  Great job!  One piece of constructive criticism:  the demeanor of both professors on camera is wooden.  I expect they're both *much* better lecturing in person.  I know from experience that you can vastly improve your performance on camera with practice and some mental tricks---like having someone watch you just beyond the camera and lecturing to them, not the camera.  As this didn't cause functional problems with the course, I'd still rate the course at 99% . :) . The stiffness of the interviewing could also be improved, but rest assured, I LOVED the class and would definitely take a class from Dr. Oakley again.  I've bought her book and look forward to reading it."

2020-07-09 00:00:00,Prince S,5.0,0.0,"-- From an introvert( who has completed his first-ever MOOC course :)
I have always been one of those people who could never quite excel in my academics. Seeing my classmates outsmarting me in every subject had always left me wondering if I wasn't intelligent enough to grasp the concepts like others. Such things can affect you in a lot of ways for a very long period. Two of the things that affected me the most are my self-confidence and my losing interest in subjects that I really loved once upon a time. Apart from the priceless lesson that this course provides, it also helped me with those two most affected parts of my life. 
About this course, at first, a massive thank you to the loving instructors of this course Miss Barb Oakley and Mr.Terry Sejnowski. Like I mentioned that this is the first MOOC course that I have ever completed, I believe that it was only possible because of the passion, dedication, and care that you show about the students in every lesson of this course. I can't remember the last time when I enjoyed learning something this much as a student. Throughout the course, I could feel a sense of security and learn purely without having to compare myself with others. Even though it is an online course you both made me feel as you have got my back. So, ya thank you again for making learning enjoyable again and most importantly for bringing back the faith in me that I can be a master at anything if I firmly believe in it and by using the precious wisdom that this course has provided me with.

2015-08-12 00:00:00,Catherine v D,5.0,0.0,"Taking the Learning How to Learn class was one of the best decisions I've made in the past ten years regarding maintaining my skills current and relevant to my professional life in high tech. I used to fall prey to a sense of being perennially ""behind"" regarding the amount of technical knowledge I need to master for my work. Since my University days, my modus operandi used to be: repetition and brute force, i.e., more or less, cramming.
After this class, I now have a set of tools I can actually relate to.  I can use them proficiently to learn smarter, retain information better, and foremost, understand what my particular ""cues' are if procrastination gets in my way again. I cannot thank Drs Oakley and Sejnowski enough for the deliberate pace of this course: they carefully pared down its content, with luminously clear explanations often delivered with a down-to-earth approach sprinkled with humor. 
I sincerely hope that this small message of gratitude will encourage whomever is ""on the fence"" to register for the course. By the way, by requesting a Certificate of Completion, I felt that I had""skin in the game,""I had a deadline to honor.  Whether tired, or pressed for time, knowing that I had paid the modest sum for my Certificate encouraged me to make time for myself to go through each lesson carefully and learn the special vocabulary associated with these new tools. 
Very best wishes to all, you will be so happy you took the time to go through the class!

2019-11-06 00:00:00,Deleted A,5.0,0.0,"I’m really thankful to Barb & Terry for the course! 
If you like me spending too much time for videos and reading
loads of articles about productivity you might have kinda mess in the head
about putting all the information in the right order. There are so many of them
and you are, reasonably, could get lost in it! 
Lucky me, I’ve tried the course and now, finally, the general
picture of how to be more productive become clearer to me.
Here are some main reasons why you need to try the course
(whatever you feeling confident in learning or not):
1. First of all, it is all about how closely
connected neuroscience and learning (+other life aspects) – everything has
scientific proof of why is it reasonable to act this way not the other one. And
yet it’s not a dogma (because loads of things we need to discover so far), but the
ideas and techniques which were presented in the course are really reasonable
and perspective.
2. The second important reason why it is a great
idea to enroll the course – is about concepts and ideas of how to deal with
procrastination – the boss-devil of nowadays, I might say.
3. Also I really enjoy the way of simplicity and
openness of how Barb presented every piece of information adding examples and
being funny (but concrete!) all the time.
I’m not putting a big review in here but saying what I found
the most useful for me from the course. So try the course and share your own
thoughts about it! I’m sure you will not regret it :)
Good luck to all and happy learning! :)

2017-06-25 00:00:00,Hugo A A O,5.0,0.0,"At the very beginning the course seemed somehow easy and pretty basic. Nonetheless, once that you start understanding the biological reason about how and why we learn, you get the feeling that this course will definitively change your life. And that is exactly what has happened to me. Before this course I had the illusion that what I was doing was normal, I mean the way in which I was accustomed to learn. However, I had that sense that something was wrong with my approach. It turns out that my intuition was right because I was completely wasting my time while rereading or highlighting the material all the time, just to give you an example. 
Additionally, I knew that procrastination could affect your life and your productivity in a way that you do not catch until you start getting anxious, for instance. Therefore a simple technique like the pomodoro, which I have been using during the last month, has been enormously beneficial for your studying and productivity.
Furthermore, there are some techniques like the memory palace, or the use of metaphors and analogies that will definitively ease your job while learning any subject.
Apart from that, understanding how your brain works and why you have certain behavior under certain circumstances, will change the way that you process any new information and it will boost your cognitive abilities up.
Please, give it a try, then you will understand what I have written here.
Learning how to learn, in my opinion, is a must, not an option.
Happy journey."

Learning How to Learn was suggested to me by a very sage friend who astutely described it as a course that ""should be required learning for all humans."" As I progressed through Learning How to Learn, explanations--and better yet, solutions!--were given for all of my bad learning habits that have dogged me for years. Just the discovery of the insanely simple but deeply effective Pomodoro technique alone was worth the time investment. I'm going to use memory palaces, hard-jump-to-easy strategies, positive thinking, consistent but reasonable study hours, and the importance placed on sleep and exercise to turn my life around and pursue the goals that have been lingering on my to-do list for the last few years. I know I'll do it know.Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski are to me what Mr. Rogers are to other people--they are kind and warm academics that make the coursework fun. I like that they use humor and funny visuals to help cement concepts into your mind. You will get a lot more out of this course if you do the writing assignments, watch the optional videos, and do the optional readings (including Dr. Oakley's book ""A Mind for Numbers"").

GREAT COURSE:

Are you a passionate learner but sometimes feel that you could do better
 with your learning? Well, this course could do magic for you. I have 
loved every bit of the course from the moment I signed up. It has given 
me an opportunity on reflect on my learning and the effectiveness of the
 methods I use. The course takes a deep look into how the brain works 
and how we can make our brains better because brains are the part of the
 body responsible for our learning. The facilitators especially Terry 
made me feel like I have studied the brain for loving. Barbara keeps on 
provide valuable techniques for learning which i surely wouldn't have 
known if I didn't take this course. Thanks for those tips. 

As a result of this course, I am sure that my learning and study time is
 going to be more enjoyable and I hope to improve my grades in my 
masters study because the techniques and tips from here can not leave 
you the same. Same of bad habits like procrastination and last minute 
study we tackled and ideas to overcome them provided. Who am I to remain
 the same?

I am truly grateful to God that I found this course. A big thank you to 
the facilitators once again and Coursera for this Knowledge. 

I highly recommend anyone looking to improve their learning methods to 
start with this course if he/she has not done it. If you are indeed 
passionate about learning, this course could do all the Magics for you.

Thank you

I didn't do that great at tests...
What this course has helped me conclude is that, I just didn't know how to learn very well. In fact, I don't think schools teach this enough to students when they are learning to form their ""very first chunks"". 
Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski have broken down the learning process and have explained it in a very simple way, using a ton of visual examples, (which by the way is a great way to retain information) and have given me a deeper understanding of using creative learning techniques to simply learning better.
They are also very passionate and excited about teaching and that makes a huge difference. They are wonderful instructors and enjoy what they do. It shows in their lectures and course material. Their videos are funny and it just made everything so much more enjoyable. 
My biggest take away from this course is that you can use science to explain how something works, but learning - that's where it becomes personal. It is a journey that is special to you, that is unique to you and only you. And if you know how to do it better, you're rewarding yourself, and you will enjoy everything you do and learn much better moving forward in your life.
Take this class.  I loved it!

Also enjoyed reading and watching the optional videos and articles.  The stories and concepts are inspiring.  It goes to show anyone can learn if given the right techniques to learn and if the person is motivated and commited.  We are home during this covid-19 pandemic so it's been tough juggling computer time to do things but I managed to do so and if I can do it, so can you.  I did at night and early morning to give everyone a chance and when the family was taking a break for lunch, I grabbed the laptop to do optional readings and videos.  The quizzes were fine and the final test was good.  I enjoyed doing the week 3 project.  I haven't received a grade on the project but I did grade and provided feedback to my peers who completed the projects.  I took the oneline course at coursera for free so I did not pay for it nor have a certification for it.  I did get 100's and 89's on the quizzes and tests and on the final got a 92%.  My point is if you plan to further yourself, it's a good idea to take this course with the expectation that you are paying for it and the professors expect only your best performance.  It's your future and your life, learning how to learn will change some things in you.  Best wishes and thank you to my two professors - it was a pleasure!  -Miguel  "

whisper that I joined the course out of boredom and curiosity but completing it
healed my trauma. At least, passing “Learning How to Learn” on 31 December 2020
made my year, not only my day. 
Recently,
since May 2020, shame, feelings of inadequacy, and panic attacks invade my life.
They started with Corona Occupation. You will forgive my metaphor when you know
that I am a Syrian who tries to make life in Germany & I am a refugee who
was raised up by refugees and works with refugees. 
It is not
easy to keep positive when your social circle drags you down. It is not easy to
keep the faith when your team questions whatever you do. I could survive
fleeing my country and the camp daily routine and many other issues but not the
chaotic uncertain environment which created the inadequacy feeling that
suffocated me till Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski opened my eyes to see all the
doors. Just learning about Imposter Syndrome opened those doors. 
In my journal,
the first entry is “Learning is not enough to put the information into
practice. I have been teaching those ideas and bringing those tools to my
students for years but, personally speaking, a tomato is not enough to reduce the
tension or to create a shelter during the lockdown. I will stop this course!”
“a tomato
to stay focused and an apple to keep the doctor away and deep sleeping to live
healthy, I need no more”, I doted these words in Arabic. "
2017-04-17 00:00:00,Kristoffer H,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course on learning how to learn.  The videos are engaging and lively, and the instructors have an interest in the subject that rubs off on you.  Dr. Oakley in particular manages to teach the material in a vibrant and lively way, although such things are a bit subjective so you may or may not appreciate her style as much as I did.  Dr. Sejnowski, while clearly engaged and inspiring, seemed uncomfortable and at times a bit stuttering in front of the camera.  On the other hand, I am in the second week of the companion course “Mindshift” now, and he is much more comfortable there.
One of the important points in this course is active learning.  The team behind the course have eaten their own dogfood by providing a lot of quizzes, polls, and pauses for freestyle reflection (text-boxes) for the student to test their knowledge of the material, as well as reflect on it.  The “honors” assignments provide even more opportunities for learners to reflect and consolidate their knowledge.
All videos are well-cited, and each module has a healthy dose of optional readings, as well as optional videos.  On the whole I feel that this optional material has given me good pointers for further self-study, as well as helping me to relate what I've learned in this course with other resources that are unaffiliated with this course.
Disclaimer: This is only the first course I've finished on Coursera.

2021-10-04 00:00:00,Taylor B,5.0,0.0,"This course feels like just what I've been missing in my personal endeavors to learn to learn better. I've been exposed to many of the concepts introduced in the course before such as memory palaces in Moonwalking with Einstein, neurogenesis and the benefits of physical exercise and other neuroscience facts in Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot and other publications, Deliberate Practice in Peak, Pomodoro technique via agile methodologies adoption of it, the Power of Habit,  etc. However, despite having these exposure, I wasn't able to put them into practice well in my own life, so they ended up feeling like techniques that were interesting and must be supported by data, but maybe beyond my reach or at least requiring too much overhead and being overwhelming to consider all together. 
With this course, professors Oakley and Sejnowski offer support and encouragement, and they tied all of these concepts together with unified model of the brain, describing how these techniques and developments in science really could transform my life and encouraging me to believe in and trust the process and do it in a way that wasn't overwhelming and prevents automatic processes and inertia from taking over. I'm excited to put these ideas into practice and see how it transforms my life and helps me achieve my learning objectives, and I believe that if you give it a shot you can be similarly encouraged."
2022-06-02 00:00:00,Robert R,5.0,0.0,"I would encourage anyone open to learning to first do this course!
Over the last few years, I have found learning to be very difficult for me. Recent circumstances saw me looking for a career change but my inability to properly learn new content proved to be my downfall.  I considered myself to be teachable so I did not understand why I suddenly was not successful at learning. After all, I was a successful learner in high school many years ago.  Nevertheless, completing this 'Learning How to Learn' course came to me as a requirement to get accepted into a job training program I applied to. I can truly say that the value this course brought to me has been remarkable. Not long after starting this course, I realized the obstacle all along was that I did not properly know how to learn. Now that I have completed this course of study, with high school long gone behind me, I was not then so well equipped. Today, however,  I find myself equipped and empowered to successfully pursue a career change, even if it means going to college as an adult. I have learned how to learn! Thank goodness! I feel like the sky is the limit and I can go out into the world and attain my dreams.
 I do not doubt that this course will benefit anyone interested in successfully learning how to learn and who does not know how to go about it. So let me invite you, be encouraged, and come on while I salute you!

2016-11-13 00:00:00,Andrzej K,5.0,0.0,"I am not sure if the course will help me in any degree but that is solely due to my laziness, low self-esteem and year long struggle with depression. However, with regards to the course itself, I think it can be very usefull. A lot of the learing tips seem common sense but for me it was very important that all of them were supported by science , not only the kind of advice that any person could give you. I can only regeret that I did not take a similar course when at school or at the universtiy. I am sure I will use, or at least try to use, some of the techniques and do more reading on the subject (using both the Web and the publications mentioned throughout the course of the lectures). In my opinion, the fact that the lectures are divided into rather short segments is beneficial as it helps to go through the course even without having much time and incresaes motivation to continue, as one is not faced with having to listen for a lecture for an hour or so. I often found myself only plannig to view one short videos and ending up in wieving a couple one after another, not noticing how much time passed. Finally, I think that both of the lecturers are a great benefit of the course as they bring a lot of enthusiasm and good will and seemed people I would like to know in person (or at least that was my impression).
 Greetings and thanks from Poland to both of them!"
2021-01-10 00:00:00,Jen M,5.0,0.0,"I found Barbara Oakley by watching her great Tedtalk on YouTube, so I remembered her name when I got an email recommending her course, Learning How to Learn. Having completed a Masters degree in Educational Leadership in the UK in 2005 it was great to have this course suddenly present itself when I had time over the Christmas break, and especially because Barbara was one of the two main presenters. She is my perfect tutor, knowledgeable, professional, but a real people person. I can understand everything she says and her enthusiasm for learning is inspiring. I enjoyed every minute of the course. I particularly like the way she, Terry and others contributing read the transcript aloud as the student can follow it by reading the text at the same time. I felt I learnt a huge amount that will definitely help me in any future studies. It has reinforced my love of lifelong learning, restored my confidence, guided my decisions in my life, and added new purpose and enjoyment in life after a bad year for me involving a separation, the uncertainty from Covid19 and other difficulties. Completing this MOOC has been better than therapy for me, and builds on the  knowledge from the Preventing Dementia MOOC. I have now experienced the benefits of learning,, and socialising to an extent in the Discussion boards and peer reviews, and cannot recommend this MOOC highly enough."
2017-12-21 00:00:00,Kate A,5.0,0.0,"I took this class before beginning completion of a formal bachelors degree at an online university. It’s been 13 years since I went to college and quit, and since it’s so much more expensive now than it was, I wanted to make sure my more mature and rusty brain would get the most out of it.
I’m really, really glad I did! I feel more confident that I’ll be able to handle the workload when spring semester starts. Not only that, but I’ve learned quite a few good techniques to handle issues in daily life as well. I also recently received an ADD diagnosis, and these techniques are already helping me learn how to use my brain better.
The most impactful is her discussion on process vs product with procrastination, and the pomodoro technique. A lot of advice that I’ve previously read said to focus on a task until it is done, no matter how long it takes; which never really worked for me, and now I know it’s because my brain is not wired for long focus on something I’m not deeply interested in. Using the pomodoro and process focus techniques, I can muster up 25 minutes of solid focus, while not letting the anxiety of getting it completed distract me for that time.
I would recommend this course to everyone. Let’s face it, most of us probably aren’t using our brains that well, and this course gives some great insights on how brains work, and how to use them better."
2017-10-01 00:00:00,Gizelle L,5.0,0.0,"I graduated from college 5 years ago and have been looking to get back into the swing of taking courses and studying to further my education, both for my career and leisure. But it's been a daunting prospect because it's been so long and I'm not in a regimented program (I work full time, so school is no longer the only thing in my life). My brother introduced me to Professor Barbara Oakley's work and suggested I take this MOOC as a ""warm up"", if you will, to not only help get me back into ""student mode"", but also gain a better understanding of how the process of learning works. I have to say, this course was well worth it! I learned a lot of valuable information, and the course has helped with some of my habits - I find myself recalling concepts like ""chunking"" and ""Einstulling"" in everyday life - and I plan on reading the optional material now that I've finished the course. The optional videos are also worth watching and help reinforce the ideas being taught in the primary lessons. I have to say that it wasn't easy taking this course - by Week 3 and 4 real life started creeping in and I found it difficult to keep to the schedule I had set for myself to ""focus"" on the material. But I dealt with it head on. The entire experience online and offline was worthwhile because this is how things are going to be for future courses I take."
2017-07-13 00:00:00,verna k,5.0,0.0,"This was a fantastic course. 
The course was in small chunks, therefore, I found it easy to complete the weekly modules without it taking up much of my day or week.
I appreciated the mini-tests after the majority of the videos as this would help me gauge my understanding of that particular video.
Having tests at the end of the week also was helpful to my learning.
The interweaving of information also helped me recall information from previous weeks.
Great tips, techniques, advice on how to be a better learner - practical tips. So just doing the course and NOT enacting the advice won't be of much use to you, however, practice the techniques over a period of time IS.
It's stuff even as someone who has completed her bachelor degree believes anyone can find this useful. I actually also was able to relate some of the things I've learned on this course to how I would answer interview questions.
The pace was consistent.
The content was manageable.
The structure was well put together.
It's free. With options to pay, so if you don't feel like you benefited from this course (I doubt it) you haven't wasted your money.
I can not say enough positive things about this course.
CONS:
Taking so long to find this course. Wish I was able to find this course BEFORE I started my undergraduate degree. But I can not in all honesty fault this course.
"
2022-04-17 00:00:00,Maximiliano B,5.0,0.0,"This course is excellent and I really had a great time over the past four weeks. I was looking for new ways to study smarter and at the same time learn about the latest scientific discoveries on this field of study.

Both professors presented the course in a very organized way proposing a good mixture between theory and practical examples that you can apply on your daily routine as a learner. I really liked the animations used on this course like the zombies to better explain how the brain works, how our habits are developed, memory techniques, and how to deal with procrastination.

Dr. Barbara is an excellent teacher and it can be seen throughout the course that she has a natural talent to teach and to explain the concepts very well. Her tone of voice is very pleasant and she presented the content very clearly. I really enjoyed watching the bonus interviews on different fields of study.

I was already familiar with some of the techniques presented such as the Pomodoro technique, however, I have learned several new ones and I have been already using them on a daily basis. Moreover, I have purchased the book A Mind for Numbers to continue my learning studies.

Finally, I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking for innovative and creative ways to study smarter and overcome procrastination."
2020-04-20 00:00:00,Itay B,5.0,0.0,"I have learned a lot during the course. The process led me into a better understanding of what I have already known, besides strengthening other aspects of learning which I had not focused much. For me, the key ideas were crucial and I can now say that I learned how to learn! The course was a very beneficial one due to the importance of the material, the great lecturers and the practical methods that can be used frequently.
Here are some of the key methods:
-To-do list
-Distinguish between the focus mode and the diffuse mode, when to use them and what their advantages
-Learn effectively different subjects using a focused small period of time and taking sportives breaks so you can enter the diffuse mode and fresh your thinking 
-get a better understanding of the memory, learning how to chunk an idea or method and learning material with a positive feeling and fun using metaphors.
-recall, memory palace, deliberate learning, outline ideas
I want to thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley for the great teaching and also to Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for the deep information and meaningful stories.
Last but not least.
I think you should try it! You can not know when you will need to use this material, 
and more correct after taking this course you can not know when not to use it!

on a des enseignants extrêmement compétents, pédagogues et humains. On est invité à ouvrir sa curiosité d'apprendre, tel un enfant qui découvre le monde. Mais ce sont bien des cours très sérieux, pour adolescents et adultes, et qui nous apprennent les meilleures techniques pour mieux apprendre, bien apprendre, appuyées sur des faits et des études scientifiques. De l'essentiel en toute simplicité. Une richesse énorme avec les témoignages de vie et des conseils de personnes extraordinaires, en toute humilité. Ne négligez pas les interviews, ils sont l'image, le concret, la métaphore vivante de ce que les cours nous expliquent. Un très grand merci.

we have very highly competent teachers, pedagogues and humans. We're invited to open our curiosity to learn, like a child who discovers the world. But these courses are very serious, made for teenagers and adults, because they teach us the best techniques to learn better, to learn efficiently. Lessons are based on facts and scientific studies. Only the Essential. A tremendous quality and quantity of information given with testimonies of life and advices from extraordinary and humble people. Do have a look at the interviews, they are the image, the concrete, the living metaphor of what the courses explain. A very big thank you."
2020-08-07 00:00:00,David P,5.0,0.0,"For anyone of almost any age (there is an associated book on Learning How to Learn for Kids and Teens) I would and could not recommend this course strongly enough.It takes a basic level of effort to go through each week and complete watching the videos and doing the accompanying quizzes.The advice Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski give is concise, interesting and practical and simple to apply for anyone.I think this is the sort of material that should be taught at schools and emphasised.Since a lot of the focus at school is concentrating on WHAT you learn but it seems the all important HOW is barely addressed though I hope with courses and information like this that will change in time for a better balance.When you think about it seems so logical and obvious that this should be taught in schools.I think if I had been taught these key concepts when I was in school things would have turned out much different but also now with this knowledge it still can turn out different.Again I highly recommend taking this course to enlighten yourself and better prepare for your next test or course of study be it personal or professional. You will without a doubt get much more out of your future studies.All the very best of success to you.Remember "" Fortune Favours the Bold! """
2020-03-30 00:00:00,Sofia A B,5.0,0.0,"Learning How to Learn has rekindled my passion of teaching
and preparing students for tests. As a teacher of Academic English and Test
Preparation, motivating students and understanding which methods would work
better for them have been quite a struggle. Thanks to this course, I now have
more knowledge to share with my learners and also to apply in my own learning
path.
 
This course starts with an explanation of the human brain
and thinking patterns, without boring you, yet including the nitty-gritty of
the foundations of learning. The analogies used in the videos and by the
wonderful teachers in this course have helped me understand complex brain
processes in a simplified, comprehensible manner.
 
The videos include the physiology of the brain and the
relevance of sleeping and exercise in forming new learning opportunities for
our brain. There are also tons of tips and suggestions in preparing for tests,
acquiring new knowledge and retaining information. As the teachers explain,
especially Ms. Barb Oakley, thinking you only have certain strengths and
weaknesses leads you to thinking that way and not taking any measures to learn
what you are not good at – which should be quite the opposite. The teachers
guide you step by step through the ideal learning process."
2017-08-14 00:00:00,Andreia D,5.0,0.0,"This is an empowering course that helps you to think you too can get better at learning and mastering complex topics. Think that schools should have this course at the beginning of their curriculum at different stages - kindergarden, primary school, high school, college and other studies. In each new stage you should revise these concepts, to make sure you are always on the right track to effective learning.
The quality of some videos and interviews could be improved (some interviews end with an abrupt cut and subjects seem to be rambling in some parts). Gave it the highest rate because of the novelty and usefulness of content but think it can be improved in those aspects. 
The course helps to overcome the insecurity that arises when going to uncharted territory and to motivate you to learn things that you don't feel naturally talented to learn (favoring a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset) and so I think it is a fundamental tool in times where continuous learning is key. 
Keep up the good work!
PS: really liked the interviews with the computer science and language learning hackers (so motivating to see that people can have that sort of motivation and discipline to learn on their own, and bring to light resources that are in most part available to everyone)"
2020-09-27 00:00:00,Vipin K,5.0,0.0,"  First thing first, Dr. Barbara Oakley is a good teacher, and trust me when I say you won't regret taking this course. Her poise, pace and voice is unique and very effective. My sincerest thanks to her and the team who has put together is course after extensive research and CHUNKING it for us. I wish I could access to this in my high school days. But, its never late!I have been trying to learn a lot of things that interests me; but never have continuity and able to finish them (if not mastering). This insightful course has taught me why and will help me see learning in a different perspective by debunking. Concepts of Chunking, Illusion of Competence, Recall & reward, diffused and focussed modes, zombies, metaphors & analogy etc., not only helps you learn but practicing them often with yourself and teaching them to others will be rewarding. The best outcome however I want to take from this course is stopping my procastination while multitasking is required.For learners - watch out for the additional interviews after every week's main content. A request, don't practice your randomness on this course, it is structured to give best results. If possible, let your kids take this course.Thank you Dr. Oakley and the team; and happy teaching more.Vipin Krishnan  "
2020-05-08 00:00:00,Hashem E,5.0,0.0,"I had a discussion with a friend on how I chose the course as she's confused between the variety of courses out there. Here's what I said. 





Reasons that I like the course:

: 1- It is quite practical and useful, very applicable in all sorts of areas. 2- Ir presents new information (and I'm not a stranger to the field) and evidence/sources. 3- It gives examples and demonstrations (esp. visual) to help clarify the concepts 4- Mixes between the personal aspect of having an instructor and the value/engagement  of  displaying images and such from the web.



Reasons that I chose the course to begin with:

The topic itself is very important, especially because it can optimize all your work (make it exponential, ya3ni if you learn faster by 2X for example, you'd have a very positive impact in your professional development and such). I was searching for the topic ""learning how to learn"" and this was one of the few courses with this title. Plus, the credibility of the instructors (e.g. Mcamaster university) and the fact that it has discussion forums   



Weakness: 

 I have to say that their visual/audio effects are quite lame and it's a  bit  crude مشرتح but I don't care much for the aesthetic sides of things so it suits me well. The content is great.  "
2017-07-13 00:00:00,Tuvshinzaya A,5.0,0.0,"Its ranking as the best course on MOOC is highly deserved! They really delivered on bringing visual aids and metaphors to the concept they were teaching - walking the walk, as well as talking the talk. As a perpetual student and an aspiring professor one-day, I really appreciated this amazing course that Barbara and Terrence have put together. I am taking away many practical lessons from this class: how to engage my diffuse mode thinking (Dali!), importance of flushing out metabolic brain toxin by sleeping, and how to keep away memory vampires by practice! Not to mention, I actually went and learned how to make animated video for the final assignment - something that I have been thinking for a while and kept putting away. This course finally provided the push and the confidence to start that project, and not only that, but I am now re-evaluating all the areas of learning that I pushed away thinking that I was simply better at other things - learning foreign languages or material science. Now I am off to find MOOCs in those areas with the knowledge that it will be worth my time and effort to learn them - even if I am not ""naturally gifted"" in them. All the love and best wishes for Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence from Mongolia! "
2015-11-07 00:00:00,Jin K,5.0,0.0,"Really useful course. It helps me review my works and study.
I come from Taiwan, currently as a MBA student studying in the UK. 
As a non English native speaker, it is really stressful to learn new things in academic level in a foreign language. I used to force myself study for a very long time without a break, but the results were not good as I expected. I blamed this to my language barrier, I thought the difference between the other successful peers is I couldn't have an the chance as the others who had better educational environment and leant English on the early stage.
This class lets me understand the biggest challenge of my learning is procrastination. Hopefully, procrastination is nothing about being stupid or should feel shame about, it is a natural metal mechanism of our brain avoiding unpleasure things. And it can be overcome by methods and practices. Pomodoro Technique really helps my memory and extends the time I keep concentrate on one thing. With the practice my brain works more efficient and it brings better result.
I recommend this course for the other who is struling with the barrier on learning and who does not have confident for himself/ herself on working and leaning. This course may change your mind. "
2016-01-29 00:00:00,Keith D G,5.0,0.0,"Hello:
I'm Keith Grimes and I just completed your course. I really enjoyed the course and feel that I've learned quite a bit about learning. I enrolled in the course simply because I felt it was time to take my love of ""the idea of learning"" and turn it into ""the practice of actually learning something.""
What I loved most about the course was Barbara Oakley herself and her inspiring story. I graduated from Oakland University with a bachelors degree in English. During those undergrad days, I often experienced the Impostor Syndrome. Discovering that there was an actual name for what I often felt, combined with the struggle to learn that Dr. Oakley experienced in her younger years, really connected with me. Thank you for sharing.
One other note... I recently had the opportunity to share many of these ideas and concepts with my son who is a sophomore at Michigan State University. As Dr. Sejnowski mentioned in the final video, the measure of really knowing if you've learned something is to teach it to someone else. Sharing what I learned with my son in order to help him along his journey as a student, was an invaluable experience.
Thanks again for offering this course.

2016-08-10 00:00:00,Janis V,5.0,0.0,"I loved it from the beginning till the end! It was perfectly structured (easily ""chunkable"":)), each video was really exciting and very easy to understand! I can only regret that I did not learn all of this back when I was studying at high school and the university. I'm sure I would have had more confidence and would have learned more deeply both several of the advanced mathematics subjects during my computer science studies at the university as well as in various other subjects earlier at school.
Among all of the great ideas presented in the course I would like to highlight the idea that you have just four or so short term memory slots available to your focused thinking as something that I think would be very motivating for anyone not to give up complex subjects. In case you don't understand something all you have to do is grow chunks of the concepts (i.e. grow some neuron connections) involved using the focused and diffuse mode and give them some time to form.
I have to get it translated to Latvian and popularize it here somehow. I think that could be one of the most efficient ways how to both increase the number of people who study the sciences as well as raise the average level of education at least a bit."
2022-05-17 00:00:00,Elizabeth B,5.0,0.0,"I've always thought that education is the thing that helps to improve your life in all aspects. So this is the course which actually changed my mindset. I've been studying much longer that it needs - 4 months, 2-3 videos each week but it's even better. I absorbed all the knowledge as kind advices from friends - thanks a lot to Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski! It was the best educational journey in my life actually, better than at school or university. This course provokes thoughts and discussion in your head and even outside - with friends and other people. After finishing it I'm so confident in myself even when I start something totally new. I'm not scared anymore but intrigued! I know that I can master anything because I know the secrets. 

By the way, this course is for everybody and MUST for everybody. It shows you how to master anything, how to learn. This is the first thing you need to study. As for me, I'm an artist. And I've started using a lot of digital instruments during the course. And learning a new language! Because studying is easy, fun and the best you can do for yourself. I really appreciate this course and want to say thank you all who's been developing it. You changed my life."
2018-01-28 00:00:00,Raj C,5.0,0.0,"This course has opened my eyes to learning and provided me with a solid foundation to rebuild my own learning methods and strategies. I have gained tremendous insight about various forces at play that need to work like a well orchestrated symphony if I am to tackle complex subjects and master learning. 
The course is structured very well with short video lectures and sprinkled with quizzes to help you retain invaluable information. Also, there is opportunity for supplemental work to further cement one's newly discovered strengths. The optional reading sections and interviews with various people has further augmented my understanding and sparked ideas for novel applications of learning. 
By applying the techniques, I have already started to retain and recall more information than I have ever done before. I have also stopped wasting my time by re-reading material endlessly or writing things down. Instead after learning something new, I pause after each key idea and test myself if I can recall the gist of it and see how it fits with the rest of knowledge mass. This technique alone has unlocked my potential. 
I highly recommend this course to anybody. I am super excited for finding something that actually works."
2020-10-09 00:00:00,James L,5.0,0.0,"Quick review. Course is a must for any discipline!

Longer Review.
As an Electrical Engineering student. We are trained in first year to learn properly. Quickly read the lecture beforehand, ask questions, do the practice tutorials the day before, read over the notes you made during the say, get enough sleep and so on. Many of the things taught in the course I already knew, but the major difference is why we should be doing such things.  You just should. However, now being shown why such things work and how everything relates to others has fundamentally changed my approach in learning my degree. Actively knowing that putting in effort in certain techniques taught here will improve the learning of the degree; and seeing the difference already in my grades and mood wasn't something I was expecting. The best part was of talking procrastination, where I knew of the pormodoro technique but it never worked due to not being able to spot the cues of procrastination. By simply saying that's cue, back to work. I can pull 8 hour days and complete all my assignments without feeling like I've killed myself . 

If anything I can contribute my degree to is this. No longer am I just passing, I'm actually doing well.
Thank you "

I had read a couple chapters of the Learning How to Learn book first, got stuck, and decided to try the course. The material is presented in quick snippets, but as I learned how my brain worked, I found myself finishing multiple videos and even clicking a couple bonus materials.Week 2's interview with Dr. Fortenberry emphasized teamwork and taking an objective oriented approach to road bumps in a learning journey.Week 3's interview Keith Devlin emphasized taking a focused approach to your work/passion and that it's ok if you don't know the solution off hand. Using the tools you do have and applying mental brute force might be your only option to start. If you don't start you'll never complete the journey that's associated with a problem!Even though I am out of school now, the course provided relevant insight to how my brain works and treating learning like building the structure of your dreams. There are snippets on how you can get past your own mental hurdles holding you back from accomplishing you goals and how you can reduce the anxiety and pressure while you get there."

video as well. The coverage of the material is also broad, I think everybody
can try to practice these techniques mentioned when they are studying as well.
 
I also
appreciate the optional content embedded in the course as well. They include
interviews (one from professor Keith Devlin, the instructor of “Introduction to
Mathematical Thinking” as well!), and 2 further writing peer-reviewed
assignment. I think these contents are what made the course so good, it
provides you with a chance to produce a project (a poster, a presentation, or
even a song!) to showcase and summarize what you had learnt during the 4-week
course. During the production of the project, I feel like the values taught in
the class is more thoroughly embedded in my mind.
 
Overall,
I highly recommend this course to people who struggle at learning sometimes
(just like me), I am sure you will learn a lot by watching the videos!"
2022-08-06 00:00:00,Margaret D C K,5.0,0.0,"A very big thank you for putting this course together. It is certainly a foundational class for all students who are beginning middle or high school and forward. Some of the techniques mentioned can elimate hours of rereading and just memorizing or last min cramming for exams syndrome. 
The focus and diffuse modes of learning, the working and long term memories are also key concepts that can be used all around in our learning. Understanding these concepts and even which parts of the brain they are located brings it home.
Learning that our nueral pathways and systems are continually growing as we give it input makes one strive to learn new things, exercise, get your sleep hours, etc
There are many gems in here for learning how to learn. The regualar quizzes and assignments are valuable for recall and transfering the learning to the long-term memory.

I am also thankful that the video interviews are clear, concise and relevant to the course. That the guest speakers are all highly specialized in their fields and hold responsible and prominent positions, have either done research in the field or have vast experience.
Thank you again for this course. Thank you to Barbara Oakley and all the guest speakers"
2016-06-28 00:00:00,Amanda P M,5.0,0.0,"Superb. This is the first MOOC I managed to finish, and now I'm actively exploring all the extra resources and videos from the course.
I originally enrolled looking for tips on how to make my courses more accessible for my students (I'm a college instructor), and also to help me hone my learning skills, since I'm starting to delve on different fields of study. Not only did I achieve those goals, but I'm also very excited to explore new MOOCs and online study possibilities.
The only downside, if one could say such, is that this course sets quite a high bar in how a MOOC should be: one can easily percieve that everything about its format -- from the weekly newsletter to the videos' length and visuals to the structure and syllabus -- is made with careful consideration of the context of online learning, and of the fundamentals of neuroscience the course shares with the students. Many (good!) MOOCs aren't as well tailored as this one.
I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested (even if frustrated!) with learning, be it independently, online or in a traditional classroom environment. Congratulations and warm thank yous to Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team!

2016-11-23 00:00:00,Rahul B,5.0,0.0,"I think this is one of the best courses I have attended. I wish concepts taught in this class are taught to every student right from the early age. I am 39 years old and as I look for a job (I was laid off a while back), I feel educating myself by getting certifications would be a good idea to enhance my prospects of exposing myself to better opportunities and with this course I have the self confidence that yes I can learn and get good grades in my certifications. 
I was getting bogged down by procrastination to a very large extent in my life and this course helped me deal with the procrastination zombies using pomodoro, this feels so empowering and I am glad I did not choose depression or bad habits. After incorporating the pomodoro technique I have also significantly reduced my 10+ year smoking habit and I am confident I will get rid of it like a champ. 
Listening to professors from such esteemed colleges and universities help break the dogma/belief in my head that people are born genius. With hard work, dedication and self-belief anything is possible. 
Lastly, I want to thank Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski from the bottom of my heart, Thank you for teaching me about learning. "
2015-11-23 00:00:00,Greg M,5.0,0.0,"After signing up for at least half a dozen (probably ~10) MOOCs over the past few years, this is the first course that I have actually followed to completion. Not only is the information relevant to my daily (non-student) life, but it is presented in an engaging and *cough* memorable way. I doubt I will be forgetting about my mental zombies or metabolic vampires anytime soon.
The two most life changing, and I mean that literally, ideas shared in this course were the Pomodoro technique and focusing on ""process"", not ""product"". Using these two new methods/ideas I have made significant progress on projects I have been putting off for quite a while.
All of the topics covered were engaging and informative, not to mention useful!
For those who are hesitant to try this course due to lack of free time, I would recommend turning up the video speeds by 25% increments, until you are at a comfortable speed where you still understand the material, but compress your time spent watching the videos. I started at 1.25x, slowly working my way up to the max of 2x by the end of the course.
This is an excellent course covering a critical topic that can improve your daily life, for the rest of your life!"
2019-06-24 00:00:00,Eduardo P A,5.0,0.0,"I took this course as part of a programming curriculum, and I was 
absolutely hesitant to go through so much content. However, I have 
absolutely no regrets!

Be ready to learn a lot about learning, as ironic as that sounds!

You will learn some basic science behind the mind and how we learn, and 
then will be exposed to a lot of different methods you can use to learn 
whatever you need. 

The content creators are qualified due to their educational backgrounds 
and often times mention the studies that support their techniques. I 
truly believe that everybody would benefit from taking this course no 
matter where they are in life.

The first week of content absolutely blew me away, and made me realize 
that I was experiencing a lot of what was covered! I thought I didn't 
need this as I have been through K-12 and some college, but it 
definitely gave me a reality check.

I will admit that I was completely discouraged when I saw that estimated
 time completion. But I highly recommend setting your video speed to x2!
 I have tons of notes on my note editing software to accompany 
everything I've learned, and I will absolutely use what I've learned 
here for the rest of my life!

2015-11-29 00:00:00,Jonathan M K,5.0,0.0,"This course is helping me solve one of the most pressing problems I am facing as a student which is how to learn on my own in online courses. After searching books, talking with people, and searching the internet, I found this course. While I was aware of some of the material this course offered which aiding in my chunking of the material in this course, the mental techniques which I was not aware of have been very helpful such as chunking in small burst with the Pomodoro Technique and learning multiple subjects in parallel rather than one at a time thus utilizing interleaving, focusing on deepening my understanding of materials I already know a bit about in the form of overlearning, figuring out ways to win against pitfalls in misunderstandings because of prior knowledge or Einstellung, and working against procrastination plus more. 
This is a great course that many people can benefit from and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have learned from Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. As a computer science undergraduate in college, these mental tools are very useful and students of other fields can benefit as well, from humanities to business and beyond.

2016-06-14 00:00:00,Andrew L,5.0,0.0,"Learning how to learn is a real thing that complete changed my life and attitude towards many things. It was mentioned that when we are born, our brain is not supplemented by the manual guide. I think this course can be a real manual guide for many of those who have taken this course. It explain the nature of our brain. When we ask plain questions such as why we should go to bed early or why we have to learn every day and shouldn't cram, sometimes we get very vague answers which cannot meet our expectations. After this course, I could totally understand the nature of my brain and my behavior. I could change my patterns and get rid of many bad habits. I am sure that this course could boost me even more. Also after this course I decided to learn Chinese. I have never thought about it, but having been inspired by Barbara Oakley I could make this very unexpected for me choice. Also I have notices that my memory skills somehow became better. I will highly recommend this course to my friends, students and many other curious people. 

I would like to thank the University of California, San Diego. and Barbara Oakley for this wonderful course.

2020-04-21 00:00:00,Vivek C,5.0,0.0,"  I have time and often started online courses and left them midway. This one, I completed within a week. The course was terrific in terms of high-value content as well as its lucidity. It provides clear, no-nonsense takeaways, which you can apply in everyday life to learn a new skill. It directly addresses the common fears everyone faces and gives you tools on how to address those fears.Some very high-level takeaways are as follows: Exercise helps you learn better, Switch between focussed and diffused (relaxed, leisurely mood) to maximize your learning potential, getting a good night's sleep is very important, deal with procrastination right-away, don't get disheartened if you don't learn something in the first go...get away, try to recall and get back to it., don't keep hammering at something which is frustrating...get back to it later, repetition is key to acquiring new skills and getting better at it, but do repetition regularly over several days and months, testing frequently your new skills is key to acquire those skills, skipping back and forth might be a good idea to solve a bigger problem consisting of many smaller problems, and many more tips and ideas.  "
2015-09-21 00:00:00,Yuuna K,5.0,0.0,"This is a wonderful class.  The entire team at Learning How to Learn have put together a marvelous course which teaches us how to learn. What I found very helpful was learning that there are things you can do to achieve competence.  Becoming a skilled learner is not magic or genetics or esoteric techniques but rather very basic things: putting in time and making it a part of daily living like eating or sleeping, practicing over time and not cramming everything into one day, making the study period consist of varied methods and material, doing self tests, challenging your self by doing hard things to deepen understanding of a topic, recalling material by closing the source or book and trying to make a brief summary statement, using mnemonic methods, analogies, metaphors, visualizations to really help you remember.  The most important take-away from this class is that learning requires me to do certain things.  If i commit to doing these things, then i can learn anything.  Doing a little every day and keeping at it will help you to gain mastery in whatever you wish to learn.  Thank you so very much for empowering manny many people by sharing these methods."
2015-11-13 00:00:00,Elizabeth B,5.0,0.0,"This  is the first class I had ever taken on the open online classes.  I took it to be prepared to take other classes. Honestly, I  figured it would be kind of like a reminder class on studying.  The Professors are amazing. The have set a high standard for other classes. There was never a dull moment.  It was so much fun and I learned so much NEW information but  Not only did I learn it but I completely understand why it works. it is great having insight into the brain and how to have it work for you. This is not the standard study skill class at all.  The names says it all.  I still surprise myself on how enthusiastic I am when I get the opportunity to use the information acquired . It really works . it's like being able to depend on a really good friend. They are always there to help you pull through and won't leave you hanging. My favorite is the Pomodoro technique. if you procrastinate this is the one to help you get stuff done.  I have incorporated a lot of what I learned into my daily life.  After being in many other classes, I have to say this is the BEST class I have taken. It's the knowledge I use most. Keep up the good work Barb and Terry!!! "
2020-08-31 00:00:00,Joachim V,5.0,0.0,"Wow, I definitely learned a lot of new things about how important it is to take our brain and the way we think and process things into our consideration with our learning. It is super significant to incorporate the right techniques into learning things and understanding things or you might not learn that much at all. ANd retaining information and actually being able to recall it yourself and test yourself on it and do these other things to really know and be confident in what you're learning is also a good thing to do. This course has so many beneficial tips and the advice that they provide definitely confirms a lot of the things that I thought might be right before on instinct but didn't really know for sure and now that I have the knowledge to use all these approaches to learning properly, I feel like I can truly ace all of my classes, maximize my productivity, and hopefully use the extent of my capabilities. Or at least more of them. Highly recommend taking this 5/5 stars just really simple and straight forward stuff that will help save a lot of time and provide a lot of useful brain shortcuts that you were never taught in school.

2015-08-30 00:00:00,Kellie M,5.0,0.0,"
I loved this course - the subject-matter was interesting, the instructor was endearing, and the content was incredibly easy-to-grasp, fun and engaging.  The retrieval quizzes were well spaced out and super helpful for embedding the new knowledge, and the expert interviews were great as well.
Two potential improvement areas: 1.) The videos featuring Barbara Oakley (which was most of them) are very low-volume.  I had turned up my device speakers and the video player volume adjustor to the maximum levels (and tried on multiple devices) but it was really hard to hear some of them without straining, and having to download the transcripts in order to follow along (which meant missed some of her hilarious visuals).  No audio issues with the other videos or in my other Coursera classes. 2.) The practice quizzes allow you to see WHAT you got wrong in a given problem (and indicated what the correct choice would have been), and explained WHY it was wrong, but the actual quizzes don't reveal either.  This made me feel anxious every time I got a question I'd gotten wrong on a previous quiz, since I didn't know what exactly I'd gotten wrong or why.

2022-08-15 00:00:00,WonderWheel,5.0,0.0,"This is my first time taking a MOOC course.  I am delightfully pleased by the quality of the videos and reading material for the Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects. As I worked through the course material, there were times, I have to admit, where I became misty eyed because of the wealth of the techniques and strategies and the clear, concise explanationsw provided regarding how to maximize one's learning. 
The scope of subjects covered during the four weeks was impressive. The topics that stood out were: comparison between focused and diffuse modes, to methods to improve one's study habits, memory, chunking, recalling, test taking,  visualization of metaphors and analogies, the Einstellung effect, interleaving, procrastination and encouragements throughout the course helped to bolster whatever doubts that may have arisen as I proceeded in answering the mini-tests, practice retrievals, and end of course week tests.  
Having Dr. Oakley's book, A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science, provided additional reinforcement as well as enhancement of the techniques covered in the course.
"
2020-04-12 00:00:00,Alex L,5.0,0.0,"I wanted to hold off on reviewing this course immediately after completing because learning is something that can only be demonstrated over a long period of time. I feel that it would be dishonest for anyone to review this kind of course which stresses the importance of spaced learning and long-term memory/chunking the moment it's finished.

After closely practicing the methods and techniques (emphasis on spaced learning method and recall technique) throughout the course and finishing the Final exam of this course, I wrote down all the important terms, concepts, and techniques with each of their respective definitions on Quizlet.

I put this whole Learning How to Learn course into the back of my mind for a month. No active reviewing of any of this material.

A month goes and I check my to-do list and it says ""Do Quizlet's auto-generated tests which uses your key terms and definitions that you wrote down. No reviewing for this test.""

I got a 100% on this informal test after not having done any review of Learning How To Learn's material after a month. I am confident in saying that if you properly execute this course's concepts, it will work."
2020-09-15 00:00:00,Kostenko T,5.0,0.0,"good afternoon, starting from this course, I thought that it would be a banal cramming of the material (I studied this way sometime 23 years ago), so even in project work for students I recalled this with the phrase: we all learned something sometime and somehow  .  But this August-September there was a radical change in the idea of ​​learning. 
the idea that a lot depends on yourself, the simplicity and availability of explanations of teachers, interest in the topic throughout the course, the application is real !!!  Techniques and Tips from Barbara Oakley Terrence Sejnowski Teachers - These Tips Help It Truthfully, Practically And Easily For The Student To Understand
So I don't want to part I'll watch the video materials again and save more recommended materials for independent study
I am grateful for this course because it gave me more confidence in myself and my abilities
many thanks to the translators who made it possible for students without knowledge of English to listen to and read this course - we learn how to learn

I have enrolled and unrolled many courses for years and never had one completed. 4 weeks ago, all of this changed. I logged into my Coursera account again after one year to try for another start and to keep myself learning during this COVID-19  and viola, I saw that I have enrolled in ""Learning how to learn""  a year ago. It's just a perfect timing. When you are having difficulty keeping your learning going and been giving all the excuses, this is the best course to start and I am happy to say, for the first time in like years since I am on Coursera, this is my first course that I completed and currently I am on another course and is half way through. Pomodoro has been my daily tools for both work and study. 7 to 8 hours sleep and exercise are my priority. To do list before going to bed keep my self motivated waking up next day knowing what I needed to get done. There's so many great tips and I feel like I can do more! Thank you for this amazing course! I can now say  with more confident that I am a learner :) "
2021-05-23 00:00:00,Lee A,5.0,0.0,"I wish I could give this course 10 starts. It is by far the best Coursera course I have taken. It quite possibly could be the best course I have taken in my life. I've had more than a few decades of trips around the sun and have a number of higher education certifications and degrees, so that's quite an achievement.
I will recommend this course to everyone I know well enough to converse with them about learning.
The course was well planned and provides a tremendous amount of substance. Just the required elements go beyond the superficial, but every week provides an extensive list of additional resources and reading to further explore the topics. 
The course actually uses the recommended strategies to demonstrate their effectiveness in every lecture.
The instructors are passionate and enthused as well as knowledgeable and accomplished. A variety of techniques are deployed to keep the content engaging and interest. I can't say how much I enjoyed every bit of this course.
I appreciate everyone who was involved in its creation. Kudus especially to Barbara Oakland, whom i've come to view as a friend and coach through this process! "
2015-09-21 00:00:00,Laura B,5.0,0.0,"Amazing course. Concepts and ideas are explained very clearly and thoroughly, and all study techniques taught in this course are based on scientific facts and research. Furthermore, option videos show us fantastic examples of people who succeded at learning, and they are all very inspiring. I don't think I can explain how much the ideas taught in this course touched me deeply. For years I've been thinking that it was pointless for me to study properly because my memory is not that great and I would forget things in a matter of weeks. Well, Barbara & co. made me realize that the development of my memory and my brain is in my hands (and not only in my genes) and I can actively work in order to improve them. Now, I won't probably get a PhD in Engineering, but I feel that -with the right motivation and study techniques- I can really achieve almost everything I want. It's really a great feeling. Thank you so much for this course. Highly recommended to everyone, but especially to those who feel insecure about their study methods and academic achievements. I wish someone taught me all of this when I was actually a student!"
2019-12-06 00:00:00,Rufus F R j,5.0,0.0,"This course is potentially useful to anyone at any age from any background.  There are useful tools in this subject matter that can help most any learner learn any subject more easily whether in an academic environment or a non-academic environment.  This course is more than a self-help course because the course lays a foundation as to how to learn any subject matter.  Because this course is contemporaneously based in scholarly and scientific research, social science, and especially brain science, the learner is benefiting from some of the most recent and sound knowledge available without pedantic complexity.  This  course takes some very complex knowledge and makes that data easily accessible to most learners such that the learners may become self-actualized.  This course can be truly transformative in nature because this course will change a learner's perspective about how to learn anything and change a learner's perspective about one's self.  This course is not snake oil.  I know because this course has changed how I learn and changed me as a person.  In short, this course has positively changed my life. "
2020-05-29 00:00:00,Omar A,5.0,0.0,"It's strange that I didn't know about the information in this course before. It makes learning fun and easier than what I used to. It's not about math or science, it's about everything you learn in live.



I recommend this course to everyone who want a better learning approach. This course is a good start to know about learning.



a Quick summery for the course:



1- It's important to know you need to study and rest. It's like exercising, You need to work, but you need to rest to let your body build the muscles.



2- You need to get the big idea of what you are learning before diving into deep details. It makes getting the idea easier.



3- Procrastination is a tough problem for learners, but you will be shocked of how easy it's to tackle it.



4- It's important to know how the brain works



5- some people are talented. others need to work harder, but that doesn't mean they are worse. If they worked harder, they will show you their true potential. Example: People with ADHD, They have to work harder to grasp the information, but once they understand it, they will be creative with it.



I wish my review was helpful.

2020-05-07 00:00:00,Oisín M F,5.0,0.0,"This easy and accessible course provides some guidance for studying more effectively, based on research in neuroscience and psychology. It gives a grounding in some fundamental cognitive processes like chunking and our working memory systems.
Later sections discuss practical tips for study, test preparation and relaxation / self-care.
It would be nice perhaps to expand on the section dealing with mnemonics and provide some more concrete, practical examples, perhaps discussing systems like PAO (person-action-object), linking sequences and the Major system for memorising numbers.
Also, for language study, there has been a slowly rising interest and awareness of the ""comprehensible input"" theory of language acquisition popularised by Stephen Krashen's work, and embodied in methods like TPRS or the ""natural method"". These approaches are very different from how adults typically study second languages, and it would be good to provide some information about them (complimentary, critical or descriptive).
Overall, this is an excellent course that I'd recommend to everybody. I look forward to more from the authors.

2021-03-23 00:00:00,Elias T,5.0,0.0,"This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about the how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.  
Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If you’re already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give you ideas for: turbocharging successful learning, including counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of your time on homework and problem sets. If you’re struggling, you’ll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track.

2020-10-30 00:00:00,Scarlett L,5.0,0.0,"This course has been a life changer.  Taking ""Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects"" and know that there is scientific research to back up the research, has been a eye opener, that anyone can learn new material no matter what the subject.  I believe anyone who has ever doubted their ability to learn any new material, or has a ""I cannot do this"" attitude should take this class: that would be me.  I always thought I had a learning challenge, turns out me and millions of others do too.  A lot of this is the ability to believe in yourself, keep an I can do attitude and to know that it is okay to make mistakes, to use that as a learning too.  Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something...give it a try, with all your might, heart and brain power.  It's  okay, keep learning, the world of knowledge is at our feet, only ""you' can decide to learn or not to learn.  Barbara Oakley and Terrance Sijnowski both do an amazing job presenting the material in their videos. This was my first online class.  I can't wait to take another course through Coursera.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,Dr M Z R,5.0,0.0,"Ramesh completed this course, spending 3 hours a week on it. 
There are lots of opinions on how to learn, which from this course it has provided me with research-based outputs that somehow or the other gave me a new understanding of learning approaches and techniques. 
Some parts are actually within my knowledge and practice, such as metaphors and analogies + visualization.
The teamwork seems to provide great reflection material. As I found that sometimes I am uneasy to perform all the time teamwork as sometimes my opinions are rejected because of my less influential behaviour. And, having a community that looks high on opinions, the influential skills are considered as a leadership norm in teamwork. However, spotting errors and noticing them from other team members are really useful. For example, when we are developing software that requires counter checking our codes. That is why we are now practising Pair Programming, even many similar communities do.
Great course. I will need to train to have a good ""holistic"" right-brain from now on.
BRAVO to Dr Barb and Dr Terry.
Thanks

2021-09-30 00:00:00,Nina ,5.0,0.0,"I enrolled in this course for fun and to check some of my assumptions and learning methods. I finished law (practicing for almost 10 years now) and can assure you studying would be a much easier and happier period of my life if I had this knowledge. Many of the positive practices and mistakes one is familiar with, but they really sound different when said out loud with examples and scientific background.

I would even argue this course is an absolute must when it comes to social (humanistic) studies and studies where you can't gain much practical knowledge, i.e. legal studies. You learn from the book, but you get seldom practice during your studies. Only when you start working, you learn all over again. So, for the type of studies where you are on your own with enormous amount of pages to learn, I would say this course is an absolute must for your sanity. For everybody else as well, of course, cause it provides valuable knowledge, but students of the 'me and my books' type of studies can really benefit.

Instructors are excellent, interviews are interesting, thank you for this course!

Best,

I found myself using these strategies immediately during the course, which ultimately helped me retain and complete the course ahead of schedule. I decided to enroll in this course before starting a Software Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera, and I am so glad I took this course first. I now have proven strategies and tactics for handling stress, imposter syndrome, getting stuck, and a test-taking 'checklist' that will get me through just about every scenario that could derail my studies.

I recommend this course to absolutely everyone! From high schoolers looking to improve their grades, to individuals of any age attempting to learn something new, for whatever reason. You will not regret taking this course!

It has changed my approach to learning and my belief in my own ability to learn and succeed in my chosen area of study.    "
2016-06-11 00:00:00,Robyn L,5.0,0.0,"It's a useful and interesting course for me.
I had graduated from university for several years.The long I graduated the more I felt hard to learn faster and easier.Too much things to make learning planning procrastinated, and I felt fidget, frustrated, and hard to concentrate.
I tried my best to find a solution (I thought).I spent much more time on learning,but that didn't work.Once I thought learning new things was for those who were young or high IQ. 
After I learned Learning How to Learn,I found I was terribly wrong.Firstly, the most important thing is,after I use these methods which the course taught,I find self -confidence feel fun and find learning is interesting.No more frustrated,and no more self-denial. Secondly,learning is a life time work,and the brain is ready for it,I just need to know how to make it prepared.
I recommend this course to those who had left school for years,and now who want to learn more.
I also think this course is useful for students to study much better.
Thank you.
(In the end, sorry for those grammar mistakes,English is not my native langue,I studied on my-own.)"
2017-10-02 00:00:00,Jun W L,5.0,0.0,"Initially I thought this course is going to be boring just by looking at the title of the course, but I was wrong. Dr. Barbara Oakley, one of the key speaker of this course was a humorous person, and I can see how she put efforts into all her content to prepare for a course that goes straight to the point where you can see direct practicality in real life, and also cut downs all the jargons into duh-duh easy to understand languages. I really enjoy my time in learning how to learn from her, and it totally re-shaped my understanding towards test-taking and what is the actual best way to study. I benefited a lot from this course. Let me end with my favourite remark from this course by Dr. Sejnowski, ""You have not truly learned
something unless you can teach it to others."" To Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski, thanks for your effort in this course. I enjoyed my time learning from the both of you. To those who are struggling with test-taking, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to consider this course, and I believe it is going to have a momentum change in how you approach learning and test-taking."
2021-05-17 00:00:00,Дарья - А,5.0,0.0,"The course has been a gift to me. I was struggling right now from the personal crisis, the feeling of wrong selection of the university, and the inability to achieve something concrete. The course has proved that there is only boundaries inside of our heads. Barbara Oakley herself is an example there is no limits to change life by selecting a new career. I cannot say that I absolutely changed myself after the course because bug changes cannot happen at once, but with no doubts, this course is a great helper for my future changes.I worked on the final assignment for 2 weeks and did a really good job. This is a good feeling of working consistently on something and achieving the results at the end.I have started too many Coursera courses, but this is the first one I am going to finish finally. I will recommend this course to everyone literally because my university was an example of how you SHOULD NOT HAVE study, but this course gives a person an understanding of it and the belief you can provide changes in your life.Thanks for teaching how to learn, Barbara and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski"
2022-05-27 00:00:00,Matas M,5.0,0.0,"Simple and elegant course to introduce you to the fundamentals of building good study habits that will enhance your abilities to learn and retain information. Topics are presented and bite-sized pieces at an appropriate speed, mini-test and questions encourage you to go back over newly acquired information, and polls and paragraphs entice you to reflect on your own learning experiences and learning journey.

This course is very beginner friendly and serves wonderfully as a resource to put you into a productive and upbeat mindset when dealing with having to study. It does appear to be quite old given the presentation style and graphics, however, this should not deter the learner as the production quality is still fairly well done. The course itself will not teach you any amazing secret techniques to ace all of your exams, but will rather build a solid understanding of how we learn, and some techniques anyone could employ to improve their learning skills.
This course will build skills that will help you live a more fulfilling life, if you choose to use them. Definitely worth a shot."
2017-06-26 00:00:00,Carl l,5.0,0.0,"I want to say a special thank you to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this outstanding course on Learning How to Learn. I have plans to put to practice the material from this course and share the key points with friends, students and associates. I am finding myself already reviewing my notes in my head. My next thing to accomplish today is to order the POMODORO Timer the one that looks like an apple. I also have plans to read more of the additional works on Procrastination and Memory. I feel a new sense of purpose after taking this course. Thanks again to Dr. Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, UC San Diego, Coursera, and all of the folks behind the scenes that helped make this the number one most popular online course in the world. I am wondering what student number I have out of the 2 million who have already successfully completed this course? Is this the end of an era of Learning How to Learn? Just maybe Watson A.I. will become how we learn in the future classroom, or on online or at home. Add VR to the mix and anything is possible. We are living in very exciting times.

2017-10-23 00:00:00,Jakub P,5.0,0.0,"Couldn't imagine better introduction into MOOCs and strongly believe this course should be included into formal education curriculum as obligatory and one of the most important ones.  That's because it deals with the very basics of education - what learning is, how do the brain do it, what processes are involved and how to use them properly. Understanding this in the first place would make huge improvement to any further learning no matter the skill.
Course could be valuable either for those starting their education (giving them proper tools, changing perspective, etc.) and more advanced learners (backing some of their intuitions with scientific data, dealing with some misconceptions, consolidating and presenting knowledge in well structured way). It's all done in layman terms and thanks to dr. Oakley in a very kind, fun and supportive atmosphere.
Another good indicator that creators practice what they preach is the design of the course itself - videos served in digestible ""chunks"", funny and attention keeping quizzes, little reviews, etc. Overall - highly recommended."

Hello, 
I am an NLP Master from France. I have developped differents skills in learning or life coaching ( Erickson Hypnosis, Neuro Semantics...) Your course is just a very good one. And for free ???? No excuse for anyone who wants to improve its skills about learning how to learn. If You are interested about the functionnal of the Brain that even the best scientist as never talked about until today, I strongly recommand you to read The Hidden Face Of The Brain written By Dominique AUBIER. You have never read something like that. I sware because she reveald what the Brain is for the Traditions and compare the Crown knowledge and the Scientist Knowledge reuniting those both approach that are usually describe as opposite. This books is probably the best TOP interleaving learning you have never read. Thank you so much for what you did. Maybe once a day we will meet. But if we don't you will shall say to all the people you know Cyrille BIKOUTA-MENGA aka WALLO11.37.04 has followed our course. THANK YOU SO MUCH Mrs OAKLEY. Keep going smiling and sharing all your knowledge."
2021-03-12 00:00:00,Starostin K,5.0,0.0,"An extraordinary course. I came here to acquire 20% of the most valuable tools to learn more efficient (which would give me 80% of the result). I've found exactly that and more! Each tool basically is explained via a similar framework, though not always in that order: a problem (e.g. hard to undestand math), a scientific explanation of a reason (e.g. math is abstract => less connections in the brain => harder to recognize patterns), a tested tool as a solution (e.g. find or create easier to grasp physical metaphors which will create required patterns  via a ""side door"").
I've found more, because I have understood that without the consistency and focus no result can be achieved - both for work or learning, for the latter especially. Now I am actively integrating the knowledge from course to my life and can already see the improvements!
My advice - if you want to seriously grow, please take time and patience to REALLY understand the concepts and REALLY integrate them in your life. Basically you'd want to integrate all valuable tools as habits in your brain.
Good luck!"
2018-04-28 00:00:00,Enyu L,5.0,0.0,"This is by far one of the most rewarding courses I have ever taken! As a psychology major, I really love the way how Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski not only discussed the many useful learning techniques but carefully explained how those methods work neurologically, and I believe understanding the underline neural networks could definitely help us make better use of what we have learned from this course. 
My favorite part of this program were actually the optional interviews Dr. Oakley did with many other very accomplished scientists and learners. It was always inspiring getting to know how they learned and what they though would be the best way to learn effectively. Also, I have to admit that the way how this class was presented -- one several-minute video for one small topic -- was in effect quite convenient when I felt the need to review a few concepts. I could simply look at the title of video and recall the points involved in the lecture.
In short, this class was surprisingly rewarding, and I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn better."
2019-09-05 00:00:00,G G,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course, I wish I had learned it before or during my university studies and not many years later. 
When I started university I had a lot of misconceptions about how to learn in a smart way. High school was pretty easy for me so I never learned how to study hard material, and subsequently I struggled through my years in university. This course is for people who lack the correct learning techniques and habits. Not everyone can force their way through university by sheer brain power - some have more and some have less of it. Understanding how your brain works and how to feed it information the right way, when to give it a rest and which kind of rest, how to leverage your diffused mode of thinking and even how to approach an exam - these are all skills that will help you achieve more, while staying focused and energized.
Even if you're busy, this course is well worth your time, and pretty much all of it can be learned without even looking at the screen, so just download the course and listen to it during your commute or your jogging. Thanks Barbara!"
2020-08-20 00:00:00,Dr. C R,5.0,0.0,"  I enjoyed the course very much!! Thank you. Highly applicable to my profession (teaching) and really useful. In a nutshell I learnt about - Learning, thinking, memory, chunking, avoiding procrastination, habits, testing, use of analogy and metaphors, and so much more - which I know will directly impact my ability to learn well and to advise my students on how to learn.The videos were short and not too much of a strain on students like me (working people)I enjoyed Dr. Barbara Oakley's way of presenting every topic - very clear, specific and ofcourse warm and friendly. It was like - she was talking to you!! Dr. Terrence Sejnowski tends to do one main video a week, detailing more on the anatomical aspect of the brain.There are plenty of interviews that you can watch, lots of reading material that was available (though I was selective about it). Its however in my list of 'to read'This course was a very rewarding one that I have taken.I highly recommend this course to all teachers, students and even parents who will understand how 'learning' can be improved.  "
2016-07-11 00:00:00,Mary V,5.0,0.0,"This course ought to be given in Freshman year of High School and again in Freshman Year of College. Dr. Oakley is a wonderful conduit for this information. In week 4 the ADD brain is discussed with examples of what the world considers brilliant men. Amazing to learn why my learning as well as my daughter's has a ""delay"".  I noticed her brain development when she was a baby.  Day after day I'd try and teach her a new word or sign language or body shape in play.  Days later after I thought okay, I'll wait and try something new, she'd do the thing I was teaching her days before.  I did not understand this at all.  For me now, I see how and why when information comes into my mind, it scatters and then days later, I feel a knowledge chunk forming.  wow.  This is something I wish I knew many years before. But it is good now that I learned so much about learning and how to feel positive about how best to use what I have to learn new things. Great course.  I believe everyone should be required to take this course early in life... and then refresher later on."
2019-12-16 00:00:00,Knut H,5.0,0.0,"
Gorgeous material, which is from my point of view extremely powerful, 
valuable, as well as very hands-on oriented. I have liked the way very 
much, how the material is presented and how nice the key ideas are 
educated in an easy to remember way. 

Already during the course I practiced a lot of it in real life, e.g. the
 memory palace technique to visually deposit items I want to remember. 
Btw and to be honest, w/o the examples in the videos I wouldn't even 
have dared to be that freaky, funny and evocative with my own memory 
images on such  ;) 

The only pity thought coming up into my mind is, that I should have had 
this knowledge 20 years earlier !  Anyhow, happy event never comes too 
late. I now switch back to master tough subjects of AI Artificial 
Intelligence, which is currently part of my lifelong learning, and where
 I made a little step from to the Learning How to Learn course. I'm 
sure, I speed there up tremendously.

Thanks so much to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team.

2020-07-09 00:00:00,Ariel M d A J,5.0,0.0,"A very good course!



It teaches a lot of techniques for studying and test taking as well as information about how we and our brains work. It talks about how we should be doing things to learn in a more ""efficient"" manner, how to be less anxious as well as some advice about decision making (don't cram, and have a good night's sleep). 



Quite a bit of what is talked here I've seen before in other places. Things such as Anki, sleeping well before a test, good eating habits and exercising (doesn't mean i applied them to my life). But it was nice to have everything put into one place. It's a way to ratify that's what i should be doing.



And there indeed were a lot of valuables knowledge to be learned here. The Pomodoro technique is something I've never heard about before, and I loved and am currently applying it. There are some ""pomodoro"" apps out there, and the one I'm using makes me feel like I'm gamifying my learning. It's really fun to study that way.



It's a very good course for anyone that wants to become a better learner."
2016-10-14 00:00:00,Kristine F,5.0,0.0,"I first took this course when I was at the height of my frustration over learning Nihongo in Osaka. During that time, I had been studying almost everyday for 11 months. I was constantly reading, reviewing, and answering exercises. I often studied until I was too tired to study any more, and yet I could retain the information only for a while. The way I was studying wasn't working for me, and I wanted to know how I can study and learn more effectively. A month after I started taking this course and applying some of the techniques presented in it, I noticed that I was able to remember more of my Nihongo lessons. I actually spent less time studying, but I think that, with the techniques I was using, I was studying in a smarter, more effective, and more efficient way... I continue to apply these techniques in relevant situations in my life now. I also review this course every once in a while. Each time, I find that I still learn something from it. Thank you so much to everyone who came together to make this course possible!"
2019-01-23 00:00:00,Lucy ,5.0,0.0,"I highly recommend this course to just about anyone as the concepts can be applicable to students, experienced professionals, instructors, researchers, etc.  With today's rapid pace of technology advancement, I find it sometimes overwhelming to know where to even start to understand some new technologies and concepts that are outside of my profession.  In fact, technology within my profession is rapidly changing owing to IoT, so I really want to understand these other technologies that are now working in tandem with my industry.  I took this course in hopes that it would make approaching some of these new concepts easier.  It greatly exceeded my expectations.  Some are completely novel concepts, while others are things I've been doing for years, but didn't actually have a name for them (e.g. diffused mode of thinking).  The course is very easy to follow and I really liked the professors.  They seem to be genuinely nice people who want people to learn and succeed.  I will end as I began.  I HIGHLY recommend this course.       "
2022-01-23 00:00:00,Yaroslav T,5.0,0.0,"A truly outstanding course. The material is both very useful and interesting. 
Without any intention to brag about, I've always considered myself as a decent learner, but when people asked me about it, I couldn't articulate why. Turns out I was already using some of the technics and approached taught about in this course. Doesn't mean it wasn't useful for me - I still learn a lot, and now I have an understanding *why* I was/am more successful in learning than some of my peers.  
The teaching staff is pleasent to listen to. Video editing has some of that ""early 2000s Windows Movie Maker"" style, but it has its charm and works our pretty well in combination with Barbara's narration. The only technical fault is that some interviews have unequal audio levels (but that's not such a big deal, also the interviews are just a bonus).
Also the course is completely free, which is nice (you only need to pay to get a certificate, but this is the kind of course where a certificate is not that needed imo).
All in all, totally recommend."
2020-05-10 00:00:00,Kerstin G,5.0,0.0,"I had an
amazing experience with this online course. Firstly, the course has a great
structure making it easy to follow Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowki! Moreover, the ideas
and exercises are easily applicable in daily life, no matter if you are a
student or already working. The techniques discussed will help with every new
project you try to tackle. Mostly, they emphasize the benefits of learning,
having fun acquiring new knowledge and shows you how you can motivate yourself
to learn. However, they also reassure you to not be too hard on yourself, to
keep practising with the beneficial methods and of course being real with yourself
about your progress. It was a refreshing perspective into an academic world
that is sadly and to our detriment still more focused on achievement than on
acquiring deep and meaningful knowledge. Therefore I really have to say: Great
job!! I am so happy this course exists. It is giving us the reality check, we
so desperately need to understand what really matters when learning! Thank you! "
2020-07-22 00:00:00,Saifa S,5.0,0.0,"Recently I started using Pomodoro technique to create a habit of regular studying. I must say it works surprisingly good in its simplicity. 
I start by turning off the wifi on my phone and I close all unnecessary tabs in the web browser as well as other programs. Then I set the timer for 25 minutes and focus on a specific task without worrying if I manage to finish it or not. Sometimes it means to leave a lecture video half way paused or even unfinished line of code but that's okay. What matters in fighting the procrastination is the focus on the process not the results. I use the breaks for stretching away from the computer.
Other thing I do is to set up a day limit on a specific hour, just like Dr Barbara Oakley explains in her course. In my case it's 8pm, after that hour I stop studying even if I didn't do as many Pomodoro sessions as I planned.
After a while I've noticed that I look forward those studying sessions. :) I recommend it to anyone who struggles with procrastination. Go on and give it a try."
2020-04-23 00:00:00,Pablo B P,5.0,0.0,"A fantastic insight into the functioning of the brain. Doing this helps 
you to identify bad habits and thoughts that will impede not only 
learning, but enjoying it.

This course does a very good job mixing theoretical explanations with 
practical tips and advices to improve your learning.  However, don't 
expect magic here, there are no shortcuts. You have to be willing to put
 the effort into the material you want to learn.

The beginning of the course might seem a little bit simple, but the last
 weeks are really worthwhile. Specially if you are taking a degree of a 
very complex subject like Physics, Engineering or Math, where the focus 
mode of the brain is encouraged and the diffused mode is forgotten, 
albeit it is  much needed too.

Al thing considered, either if you are an unquiet person, who likes to 
learn constantly, or you simply want to learn how to improve your 
academic performance, this course will give you what you need.

I feel that this should be taught in the first year of college.

I coach students in grades 9-12 to apply strategies that will maximize their learning in all subject areas, and I took this course in hopes that it would be a means to validate and enhance my teaching practice. The clever lectures did not disappoint! I learned several new ideas and strategies to bring to my practice, including an interesting test taking strategy linked to focused and diffuse modes of thinking, which I found fascinating and very applicable. I was able to link every lecture to previously learned content on memory, language acquisition, attention, and comprehension. I especially appreciated that the lectures were short and clear; the instructors are obviously well aware of what the research tells us about sustained attention - and they practice what they preach. The spiraling nature of the course was also very helpful; the brain loves spaced repetition! I am enthused for the new academic year to begin."
2020-07-08 00:00:00,Boussoualim M,5.0,0.0,"After just one week of learning with Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, I feel that this is the ressource I have been looking for for a long time. Nowadays, the internet is full of material about personal development, about how  to achieve miracles in fast learning, fast reading, fast calculating, in activating different parts of the brain, ...etc. Though I obviously do not much trust this kind of material, I have always been looking for reliable sources that answer so many questions about learning and about how the brain works during the learning process. Learning How to Learn offers all that anyone needs to know about how the learning process develops in the brain while at the same time learning so much about the secrets of the human brain and its potentialities from brain specialists and researchers. What makes the course more interesting is the reliable and rich resources and the well-grounded scientific research it uses to demonstrate the validity of the learning strategies suggested.

2019-10-20 00:00:00,Catherine B,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course! Even though I am myself a professor in an engineering discipline and very experienced at ""learning"", I discovered new things in this course and I also learned reasons behind some aspects of learning that I know from intuition and experience. It is very helpful to understand the neurological underpinnings for why certain methods of learning and studying are beneficial. The concept of ""chunking"" is very powerful. The rational behind metaphors, mnemonics, and memory palace is really interesting. The reasons that spaced repetition of concepts are effective, the function of the diffuse mode of the brain, and the simple ""pomodoro"" technique are all excellent concepts and incredibly useful in learning engineering concepts, languages, or anything in life.  The instructors are excellent, the videos, illustrations and text are well thought out. Highly recommend this course for anyone at any level! I have recommended it to fellow professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and my children.

2018-06-18 00:00:00,Cara,5.0,0.0,"From different brain modes to research-proven learning techniques, this course not only covers how brain works but also what works for the brain. It is a constant reminder that the brain is a powerful tool that learners of all kind could benefit from knowing it a little better. Besides, this course give scientific backings to ideas such as changing your thoughts can really change how your brain work, and leisure activities are not just good for you, they are essential in stages of learnings etc. These are all powerful life-style suggestions that could help us live better, happier and more efficiently.Lastly, I found taking this course in itself is a power tool against procrastination. A few minutes a day of listening to the videos got myself start thinking about my learning methods, and I would usually go to with a productive day of trying to challenge myself according to the suggestions from the class videos. Thank you for such a great course. I only wish I could turn back clock and take it earlier."
2021-01-30 00:00:00,Jaime H,5.0,0.0,"Dr. Oakley is one of my top three favorite professors of MOOC courses because the content is relevant and applicable. For reference, I have been taking online classes for over 20 years; I teach and also have an EdS and MPH.   I have been in school most of my adult life, and it was a pleasure to take this class. 
I learned a few tips to help my adult students learn better and retain the information longer.  I have also found myself sharing this information with anyone trying to learn anything new and especially complex subjects.
The content builds each week with quizzes, lectures, and she provides in-depth references that allow you to dive into a subject deeper.  There are also additional lectures, interviews, and content, making it a really in-depth course.  
This subject will likely appeal to students, but any teacher, parent, or employer reading this should take the course as well.  You will learn how to help others learn anything better.  Highly recommend this course and Dr. Oakley's books!

2019-06-14 00:00:00,Sara K,5.0,0.0,"  Learning how to learn didn't start out as a course I thought I would be very interested in. I took it because I could audit it, it seemed like a kind of easy class, and I wanted to make sure I could handle taking a course online. But this course turned out to be great, and I would recommend it to anyone doing anything, but especially students in school. This course should be required for all high school and college students. It teaches you about which study methods are most effective, how your memory works, how procrastination works, how to reduce test anxiety, and much more. The videos aren't always so engaging, but that's because it's a lecture, and they're cut up into short pieces, so it's easier to focus on them for a limited amount of time rather than an hour long lecture. I'm really glad I took this course and I'm grateful to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for allowing people who aren't enrolled in their university to take it. If you're wondering whether to take the plunge, I say do it.  "
2020-04-16 00:00:00,C2,5.0,0.0,"I always remain excited to learn new skills. I had my  birthday exactly 10 days before today.I was just counting the new skills I learned in the previous year the list includes, volleyball, mandala, speed reading , journaling and etcetera. When I found my sister talking about this course it was like my dream come true .I was looking for a course of this kind for so long and the good ones are often expensive, but what coursera is providing is  qualitative  filtered material free of cost. 
I have a list of skills I 'm about to learn this year and I know that the techniques like pomodoro,  planning before sleeping, using two modes of thinking ,chunking , sleeping well ,exercising , memory PALACE will be of remarkable help.
The most astonishing idea that had just stuck in my mind is that you can change reality by changing your thoughts and perseverance is more important to be successful rather than only being smart.

THANKYOU so much Barb and Terry for teaching me things in simple and  deep way . "
2020-04-21 00:00:00,Vipin B,5.0,0.0,"  This Course by Barb & Terry is amazing. It has opened many new thinking fronts. Or I can say developed an understanding about how to learn. How the mind works and, how one can overcome with the difficulties of learning new things or subjects. Before starting of the course, I am not confident of myself that I will be able to learn this course or any other course as earlier, I used to start a course and, then soon after starting, I never return on that course. But, with the help of Barb's easy instructions or I should say very simple teaching techinques, I started liking the course. And, then also practising their teaching on day to day life. It haven't changed me fully but yes now, I have changed so many things with the help of this course, that itself is a great thing. I must say one should take this course and, it's very helpful, easy, simply & beautifully taught by both the instructors. Thanks for their valuable inputs and, making changes in the many lives. Wonderful & great work.  "
2022-03-13 00:00:00,Nicole C,5.0,0.0,"I am learning to be a Software Engineer. My instructor advised us to complete this course because they said that we need to learn how to learn, and that a lot of study habits we learned growing up are actually ineffective. Barbara, the instructor of this course, taught me a lot about how bad my old habits are. I felt personally attacked at the fact that she so accurately pinpointed all of my bad study habits. 

I now have a better understanding on how I can be a more effective and productive learner and I cannot wait to see the difference in how much information I can retain. Also, Barbara mentioned it once, but download Anki! It works and a lot of medical program students rely on it to get them through their program. It is a flashcard system that uses spacial recognition, so you may not see a flashcard that you made for months or years if you know the material well enough. Anyways, I learned a lot of interesting things and I enjoyed Barbara's enthusiasm through the whole program."
2021-07-23 00:00:00,Marlene D,5.0,0.0,"When I started to do this course I really didn't know what to expect in terms of the course material.  However, when the professors began to explain how our brains work to the various techniques to apply in learning I was very very happy even overjoyed. 
I particularly loved the POMODORO TECHNIQUE and the various rewards which I began to attach to it which I learned in the portion of aloting yourself a set time for studying.
Who would think that ""walking"" is related to brain energy as Professor  Terrence taught.
Then these modes of learning entitled Focused and Diffuse. And if I could explain it this way:Focused mode is for receiving and storing information and Diffuse is for retrieving said info but in a state of rest.
I would highly recommend this course to anyone who desires to have effective learning tools to implement while learning.
A very very heartiest ""THANK YOU"" Professors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski and their team for creating and presenting such an awesome course."
2022-06-20 00:00:00,AYUSH S,5.0,0.0,"I am a Civil Engineering Student currently in my final year of my bachelor's (4th year). I took this course in my first year since I was not receiving good grades. ( for instance, my grade point in the first semester was 8.1/10). Civil Engineering being a diverse discipline has in itself a lot to learn and has numerous concepts. This course helped me make a proper approach and effective to handle the difficult subjects in further semesters. My semester grade points too showed the result of the systematic study pattern I learned through this course. for instance, my semester grade points in further semesters 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th came as 9.38, 9.36, 9.02, 8.7, and 8.92. There was a significant improvement I saw in my grades as well as I feel mentally prepared for any subject, doesn't matter how difficult it will be. I would like to thank the instructors of this course for this amazing course. No doubt this course deserves more than 5 ratings !! Happy Learning! All the Best!"
2020-02-26 00:00:00,Keith F,5.0,0.0,"Top class course presented in a straight forward and practical way. They give you bit-size pieces of information that you can easily learn, apply learning methods to the real world (it does not get to theoretical) and they actually practice what they preach. For example, at the end of each part of the course they ask clear questions to secure you recall your key learnings. There are also short and simple practical tests at the end of each section which are supporting your own development and learning. The course has mandatory material and additional material which is of interest but not required, In addition, you have the opportunity to review short papers developed by fellow pupils. You can opt in or out for that but I opted in and found it very inspiring as people were very open and vunerable about their situations and learning opportunities. Great course! Would highly recommend! My own objective was to support my own learning as well as to learn tools for teaching others."
2020-04-19 00:00:00,Chelsey E,5.0,0.0,"  I took this course a starting place for my self learning journey. This is ultimately he best learning course I've ever taken. The material is easy to digest, presented in an engaging format and there is a lot of room to grow. While most first year teaching courses focus on teaching students theoretical applications of learning, this course is focused on teaching each participant how to identify their own learning strengths and how to work on their learning difficulties.Both of the presenters are engaging, although Barbara did a much better job of connecting with the audience than Terry. The featured guest talks should really be mandatory as the information presented by the guest helped to bolster the topics covered in the course.All in all I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who is learning anything ever! This not only allows you to learn about the theoretical applications but will give you the tools to understand why and how you as an individual learns. 5/5!  "
2020-08-19 00:00:00,Narik B,5.0,0.0,"Highly informative course, very fun and concise deliverance of teachings which makes learning how to learn exceptionally easy. This course undoubtedly equips you with many highly effective tools to use in the pursuit of knowledge in any field. Highly impactful and greatly recommended to anyone at any age who is interested in gaining mastery in any field.The knowledge gained from this course goes beyond the realms of academic study and can easily be applied to many avenues of life. The skill of learning is essential and beneficial and this course not only provides knowledge on how the brain works, but gives key insights as to how to harness your brain to engage in deep learning and understanding of material. The interviews of persons who have displayed great prowess in learning and memory allowed captivation and motivation as to what is humanly possible. It was very impactful to know what has worked for persons and to be able to incorporate these methods into my learning. "
2017-09-02 00:00:00,Rishabh M,5.0,0.0,"A wonderful course that collects various important tidbits of information related to learning and an explanation of how these can be included in our daily routines to make ourselves more efficient and effective learners. The beauty of this course is that:
1. It's a collection of ideas, tools and techniques that you would normally need to scan several sources for. It collects them and presents them in a way that is most useful for learners.
2. The videos and short and easy to grasp. Rather than overloading students with information, it has been broken down into smaller 'chunks' (ha) that are easier to process. 
This course should be mandatory for students across the world because even though our educational systems make outcomes quite clear, there is little explanation of what a good way to achieve those outcomes is. Great work by everyone involved. Highly, highly recommended course for anybody struggling with learning anything new or just wanting to become a better learner.

2020-07-01 00:00:00,Larissa V A,5.0,0.0,"I really loved the course, I was looking forward to the classes, which are light, relaxed and packed with valuable information.

I can say that I went through a journey of great reflection, self-knowledge and retention of valuable information.

The course introduces various aspects of the learning process, from how your brain and memory work to tips for passing tests. In general, all the tips presented do not apply only to specific academic subjects, they apply to any aspect that we are trying to understand / know.

Class information is light, clear and objective. During the videos, and as new concepts are presented to us, old concepts are continually recalled, rooting the concepts learned in our memory. Tests are also of great value for fixing what has been learned.



I offer my most sincere thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski who were at the forefront of transmitting the content, but I also thank the entire team behind the production of this incredible course."
2021-07-27 00:00:00,SERGIO R,5.0,0.0,"i would highly rate this course, as it gives learners of all types and abilities a multitude of strategies and tools by which we can think about how we learn and adapt our learning style with the theories and tools which the two professors present.  it's a rich course with many voices adding to the texture of the learning fabric:  there are many amazing interviews which really augment the ideas put forth; and even add to them with original ideas and strategies of the interviewed guests.  it's a very good course, a very nice conversation between the professors Oakley and Sinewski and the audience, as well; so it's a pleasure to return to these lectures through video-memory, dissect the chunks of information made up from my personal impressions, and rethread the ideas presented into a tapestry of my own learning based on the long and carefully spun threads of information presented by these two professors.  really a very nice experience to be had with this course."
2020-04-08 00:00:00,Rachel R,5.0,0.0,"Participating in this course was a high point on my weekly task lists! Barbara and Dr. Terry have incredible attitudes and are so motivating and encouraging, making it a delight to learn from their exceptional knowledge. They compile the information in a way that is easy to follow and understand and offer realistic and practical insights backed by a lot of science and empirical evidence. They even apply the tools and resources they recommend throughout the course, driving the ideas home through immediate practice. I found the course to be truly enjoyable and incredibly helpful! I have recommended it to friends and family throughout the time I have been taking it and will continue to do so! It is helpful for any age or demographic. Whether you are in the midst of your studies or need to warm your engine back up after some time away from learning, Barb and Terry remind you to take charge of your own learning and provide you the tools and kind motivation to do so!"

After finishing that course I can say that it is quite useful. If you 
are not a biologist you can learn some new things about the structure of
 our brain and how it works. If you are a biologist, you can refresh 
that material :)

Although I had known a lot of things that were mentioned in that course,
 I could look at them from the other side due to teacher's explanations 
and my own insides. 

Also that course helped me to structure all that mental tools and gave 
new knowledge. Moreover, I noticed that I began to really USE a big 
amount of the methods for better learning. 

The atmosphere is great there. I got a lot of possitive emotions. 
Teachers show you how to use different tools with examples. What's more,
 they use that tips to make their own videos. If you notice that, you 
have even more examples and you can feel how it actually works.

So, I recommend you that course, especially, if you want to become a little bit better version of yourself.

It was also to give me some tips on latest thinking for assimilating new information which I was then going to apply to other online training materials, more specifically work related. But it became a fascinating project in its own right and I would love to spend more time looking into the further reading and possibly even tackling the Honours assignments. More likely for the To Do list for retirement, just for interest.It is fantastic that professionals in the business of teaching and research have given their time freely to produce such accessible and enlightening materials - thank you Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski.

2019-03-27 00:00:00,Steven H,5.0,0.0,"  There is a lot that can be said about this course. I will try to keep it short. This course, for me, was a refresher, in the sense that I needed to get back on track. Specifically, I needed to get back in the mindset that fosters learning. I enjoyed the course and would recommend it to anyone. It has given me the can-do attitude needed to continue assigning time to learn new and existing subjects. Moreover, it has opened my eyes to the notion that procrastination does not have to define you, and that with a little will-power, one can achieve anything.Full disclosure: there were times when I temporarily lost focus, became bored with the content, which was primarily due to the fact that I was not using the techniques discussed in the course, such as the Pomodoro technique, which would have helped me tackle the course with more mindful intent. To anyone that is interesting in the fundamentals of learning and best practices, this is the course for you.  "

Or spending your time studying for courses but not feeling you're getting enough out of it as you could?  Or perhaps you just want to understand a little bit more about how the brain works and how you can get more out of it?  If so, Learning How to Learn is for you.  This lecture-focused course offers many great insights and tips for studying more efficiently and learning more efficiently--whether you're still in school or long graduated.  I really looked forward to the next week's lectures and often watched them more than once.  I finished the course feeling like I learned new tools and was reminded of other things long forgotten.  The weekly quizzes and challenges after each lecture help to ensure that you are understanding the finer points of each week. I decided to take this course before taking other MOOCs. Well worth the time and effort."

It is beginning of innovative learning process for me once again with creative
insight. It is very favorable to person like me who is professional
already and completed doctorate long back. The process and skills have been
explained so well in this course that I was able to get connected with
motivated student in me. I was very happy to practice with Pomodoro technique
and I started working on it while I was studying this course. I also appreciate
the spaced repetition for efficient learning. Coming from behavior
science background I feel the scientific base of this course is as strong as skills aspect
of it. I learnt to relax while learning as well as I experienced joy of learning.  Though,
you may be highly educated, as a student of this course you can always progress further. At

Absolutely terrific course, easy to digest, and perfect for first time MOOC'ers. I was familiar with a few of the techniques and didn't realize I was already doing them. It was awesome learning some of the science behind how, and why these techniques work.  This course has definitely informed me on some EXTREMELY use-full learning and studying techniques!  I highly suggest getting Barbara's book as well; it is also easy to digest but intellectually stimulating. While it is not necessary during the course, it is an excellent tool for interleaving your learning by reading the book after completing the course. The optional interviews are very helpful as well, they are structure to be part informative and part review and part inspirational; the instructors clearly understand the concepts they are discussing.  After altering a few of my habits, I have already experienced a big difference in my learning abilities.
Thank you Terry and Barb!"

The additional reading material and interviews were fascinating. The biggest positive I got from this course was a change in my thinking. I used to believe that your scores on tests were determined mostly by genetic aptitude, and even if I studied smarter and harder, I wouldn't do much better. After applying what I learned in this course, I see I couldn't have been more wrong. I actually enjoy the process of working now, because it can be interesting, and doesn't involve as much of the self-hate and negative emotions that are a result of excessive procrastination. I'm excited to sit down and get stuff done! The course also encouraged me to check out other methods for increased productivity that I'd heard of, like having a system of accountability partners and kanban."
2020-04-14 00:00:00,Thomas G,5.0,0.0,"Just completed the course. The introduced ideas and concepts seemed helpful and interesting to me. I learned a lot about why my brains doesn't like studying and how to improve my learning experience. I even got a tool (-> Pomodoro-Technique) that was of huge help for me personally to finally start developing some discipline. What I also liked about the course is that a lot of the techniques, like spaced repition, find direct practice when following the course. The course doesn't just teach you stuff about learning, it actually shows you how to learn by doing. Before the course I had lots of problems and wrong ideas about learning that were tackled by this course, like the idea that I need to be really motivated to learn, or that I often made the mistake of focusing on the outcome of my learning. Now I know that the focus should be on the process, the product then comes on its own. I'm very glad that I went through with it. "

I found this course very interesting and useful. I think anybody 
interested in learning any kind of subject or skill, either 
intellectual, physical or both, will gain a lot by taking this course.
I wish I had known these things when I was getting my degree in 
University. And I'm convinced even kids as young as 10 should be taught 
some of these techniques, even if some details could be skipped in that 
case.
Another great thing about this course is the amazing delivery of 
Professor Barbara Oakley. She has a great way of talking that keeps one 
paying attention to every word. I've seen some MOOC where the person 
looks bored and like he/she is just reading a text without any emphasis.
 Professor Barbara Oakley, on the other  hand, shows just the right 
level of excitement when teaching the material. Not looking bored and 
not over the top. Just perfect. Her interviews are also very 
interesting. Five stars, for sure.

The course is set out very well and the way the topics are covered with videos, readings, quizzes, and interviews is very interesting and helps cement the information being discussed.  A big shout out to the two teachers Barbara and Terry, they present the information in a clear and simple manner, and you can see how they are passionate about helping people to improve their learning skills.  I am so glad that this course was one of the ones recommended by the team members of Class Central that I was able to discover it.

What was even more astonishing is how  they shared the experiences, encouraged collaboration within the class roaster, those triggering development of other skills such as communication, research, ideas exchange, including the ones freshly described in the course, such as teaching the others trough reviews. We also had insights on how it works in real life, practical advises, hints and tips, do's and don't-s, when it comes to tests for example, and very detailed, inspirational and interesting, suggestions on additional materials, and further readings .

I like the course that has a lot of neuroscience research back-up so that the learning methods suggested by are more reliable. Although it is scientific research base, it does not mean that it is away from the practical purpose. In fact, the topics are very practical for any learner. And the course helps me to resolve a lot of doubts on some ""myth"" about learning methods. I also like the optional interview with different successful and adventurous learner in the world. The stories of the guests are very encouraging and inspiring. Their special learning methods also echo the content of the course. It strength my understanding of the concepts.

It's not the first learning course I take and I must say it's one of the bests.Its a short, simple and accurate course that gives you small but incredible useful tips and information to perform better at actually whatever you are trying to learn. It focuses on the way our brains work and gain knowledge, whether its artistic, scientific or even muscular (dancing, gym, etc), so whatever you may be facing this course will probably be useful to you.The course is short, does not demand tremendous amounts of time and the teachers and videos are of excellent quality and content, also very charming and kindI must rate this course of a 10/10 completely recommendAny age, specially school students and college students, but hey! we never stop learning so feel welcome to take it"

In the course, you can face several rather complex concepts, which initially seem difficult to understand. But the way Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski present the material makes them much easier to understand. They use good picture analogies and metaphors to explain the material. I'm not a native English speaker but I took this course and passed all tests successfully. It made me believe that I can do much more about learning, helped me not to give up when I was about to drop out of my English classes. I've learned that when you struggle with a new concept, you just need to approach it from a new angle to make understanding smoother. And it's very important to let your brain have a rest from time to time. Thanks for teaching me how to learn.  "
2018-03-18 00:00:00,Iryna S,5.0,0.0,"  The course have given me a great motivation and a lot good ideas, approaches to self-improvement and good news about my brain. For instance, doesn't matter your age or a talent to the current science, you can try to do something new and get success, if you learn effectively. The teachers Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Thierry Sajnowsky based all them conclusions on them own experience and practices, so if they told regular exercises help to learn effective, I believe. Maybe that only one advice I haven't tried yet - it's a running, according to the extremely snowing weather in Kiev now... But I will do it with understanding of helpfulness for learning, switching mind mode and solving a difficult problem. If you finish the course, maybe you won't become a professor, but you get a keys for the progress in learning, planning working tasks, overcoming procrastination etc. So learn or don't, isn't a question now.

I believe that I have gained much understanding and insights into how to learn smarter and more deeply.  This course has shed much light on how the mind works, and how to harness that knowledge in learning, in creating attitudes, beliefs and perceptions that are beneficial. It was shown how to apply that knowledge to habit forming. Along the wsy I gained tools and approaches that can be applied accross a wide range of disciplines. The lecturer Barbara Oakley captured my attention and my imagination. The video lectures were carefully crafted to communicated ideas in a simple way, yet they were wide in scope,and had great depth. I  am now better equiped to continue on my journey of life long learning using the knowledge gained from this course. Better learning leads to better solutions, so this course is worth investing in."

On the contrary: not only the course helped me to structure things I already knew, but also I was positively surprised with the amount of new knowledge!

The concepts are presented in an interesing way, with many examples and analogies to illustrate them. There are plenty of tips that can significantly improve the process of learning with moderate level of up-front effort.

I like how the course is structured, with multiple quizes in each section.
There are also plenty of references to scientific papers included in each part for further research.

I really enjoyed going through the course and I'll not hesitate to revisit the material after some time in order to reinforce my understanding and ensure that the knowledge stays in the long term memory.

2020-04-24 00:00:00,Abdul B,5.0,0.0,"LHL is my one of all time favorite MOOC. It helped me rethink my entire understanding of learning and equipped me with powerful mental tools (in all earnestness) that made my learning more conscious. To mention an example: I had the habit of writing down everything when I started learning something new. I will keep on writing down points to the extent that I feel I am comfortable with the subject in a short span. But I have wondered at a later point of time for myself unable to recall the subject/ topic. Only after taking the course, I learnt about being falsely confident about things when we are obsessed with writing. 
Likewise, I could mention several personal benefits I received through the course. Another point worth mentioning is the weekly email from the team. It has useful recommendations of books and websites related to personal development.

It's also very conveniently the most time-effective one because it teaches you a broad variety of tips and ""cheats"" for hacking into your own mind and making yourself feel and BE more productive.
In barely 4 weeks, and without any technical language (even the optional course book is written as if it were a friend talking to you!!) I've learned how to beat one of my biggest problems -procrastination , how to become more productive in the way I study (learn more in less time) , how to memorize things strongly and when to use long/short term memory and how to improve them, how we sometimes unconsciously block out correct answers while taking tests, in which order it is best to answer questions on tests and why focus on things in a broader context rather than seeing only the small picture (forest vs tree analogy) amongst many, many other things.

Although I was not able to push forward with the written assignments , this course gave me the inspiration I needed to challenge myself  and has inspired me to look at things in a renewed prospective. I have always dreamed about going into academia, but felt that I was burdened with many learning disabilities. Such as never being able to take tests or reading to slow or not being able to write well, and even being diagnosed late in life with dyslexia. I hope and intend to use what I learned in this course to fight off the demons that have prevented me from finding my  passion.

exams and deal with the exam stress?"" And guess what at the end of
this course there is one final test in which the questions are totally related

completing the course I was rather excited and feeling positive towards the
exam and didn't feel any stress. I scored 92.06% in the final test in first
attempt. Which I believe is very good achievement from my perspective. 
Thank you so much I am definitely going to apply all the
tips that I have learnt in this course in all my exams from now onwards."

The professor explains everything in a really simple manner and it was a surprise to see all course not more than 4 min. None of topic looked complicated to understand, very nice paced with images, videos.
It was pleasure to complete this course. 
Course material are really intensive and you could sense the amount of investigation and research has been conducted by the team to come up the course.
Main highlights 
Interviews at end of each week from highly intelligent people with tips, solutions which worked for them. 
I am a believer now that anyone can learn anything. Thank you so much for making this content. You are truly helping mankind here."
2018-09-23 00:00:00,Fernando L C,5.0,0.0,"Thanks  Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!  Just super helpful. This course is a life changing MOOC and I believe I should be teach in primary or high school or at least in first year of the university. 
I was skeptical to take this course because I believed that I was a good enough learner but I found so many useful knowledge to apply on a daily basis. I have already used pomodoro technique and have done a TODO list almost every day for several years but I focus always on ""the product"". Now I'll start to focus on ""the process"" and do my TODO list at night rather than in the morning. And also I'll do more ""active learning"" like retrieve the material and test my self and I'll spend less time in ""passive learning"" like re-reading and doing mind mapping without any test in between.
Thank you for teaching how to learn. I'm Fernando Conde.
And until we meet again, happy learning! :-D "
2019-02-17 00:00:00,Sébastien L,5.0,0.0,"This course contains invaluable information to help you succeed in life. The instructors back everything they say with lots of good and interesting references, which are available to consult at the end of each module.They presented some strategies for studying that were really useful, the best ones being ""test yourself"" (practice testing), distributed practice (space repetition) and interleaved practice.Students can also learn quite a bit about procrastination, memory, sleep, mindset, motivation, creativity, overlearning, chunking and other complementary resources that help you learn.I especially enjoyed the optional interviews at the end of a few modules! If you read every single reference mentioned (including books), you may end up spending well over four weeks learning from the material presented in that course. Otherwise, this can be done in a few days at most. Highly recommended!"
2015-09-08 00:00:00,Yolenny C,5.0,0.0,"For as long as I can recall I've had problems to remember things I thought I had learned. But just short ago I realized I was unable to remember things. I wondered why I was so good at anything I undertook at the moment and all the content that I had seemingly storaged in my brain disappeared. 
Another thing that caused me a lot of terrible consequences was procrastination. I can gladly say that it doesn't have the same power over me. Now that I know what It is and how it works It's become easier for me to deal with it. I've found the Pomodoro Technique highly effective and insightful.
By taking this course I was able to find the failures that were holding me back in my learning. This course has enabled me to be a better learner. The tricks provided in this course doesn't take a super overwise person to grasp and put them into action.
Thanks for teaching me how to learn more effectively. "
2020-10-21 00:00:00,Chew R,5.0,0.0,"A truly beneficial course to pursue to further enhance learning capabilities. I have been naturally applying some of the learning methods that have taught in this course, but due to different local learning culture in my country, I was forced to think that such learning method is ineffective, but this course have re-established my passion for learning again.



Going through this course helps to solidify a true fundamental learning method that helps in every single subject and truly understand them rather than to just ""remembering"" the context. Instead, applying the Learning Methods that are taught in this course, helps us to Understand any subject and be able to apply what we have learned, even for a lifetime.



Am really appreciative of this course for how it have changed my life in a way, and I feel it would be a great lost if anyone who would skip this course after coming across it."
2019-01-08 00:00:00,Brian B,5.0,0.0,"Definite eye opener.  
Think back to junior high (Grade 7 or 8) and think how you approached homework.  Look at a problem, look at the solution; ""pfft, I got this, this stuff's easy"" Honours certificate please!
But then you got to high school and thought, ""hmm, I kinda got this stuff, I should be good for the test"" and thus proceed to cram your way through every exam.  
Marks? Varied, from yeah, not bad to absolutely MEH...
University? More of the same.  Your job, a little better, but kind of FEEL meh...
It's ok, you just didn't know how to study properly.  
This course will teach you how.  And more importantly--at least for me--the why.  As you'll see CONTEXT MATTERS A WHOLE BUNCH when you're tyring to remember stuff.
And couldn't do this review without a shout out to Barb (the girl in all the videos).  Endearing, encouraging, so knowledgeable.  Check out her interviews she's really good."

I am a senior citizen who has just superannuated from a career spanning nearly 39 years. I am lucky that i got introduced to Coursera and further to this course through my sons. I believe, completion of this course will be a game changer for me, during my second innings. Till now i thought that i had a weak memory and i could not retain things. This is a self-image of the past, and now i know that learning and remembering is a game with a set of rules which can be learnt and mastered,



I have started learning a new language and certain other skill sets getting help from the tips and information i gathered doing this course,

2021-07-26 00:00:00,Dinh D P,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoy the course, and there are many reasons why I love it. Firstly, the educators are inspiring and motivating. They really  motivate me to study and give me insightful ideas about learning, which 
enables me to understand how our brain works and some of the phenomenon  in life, such as ""ah-hah"" moment when you find a solution while taking a bath, or solving the questions that are difficult at first but later are easy for the mind. Not to mention, the test taking tips are  practical.  I would love to try ""Hard start jump to easy"" while doing  tests in the future. 


I really really recommend everyone, whatever your disciplines are, to join this course and absorb the wonderful knowledge and ideas from top educators, professors and outstanding individuals. The tips can be applied to any fields, and the lessons are straightforward to understand. Best wishes for everyone!

And it starts with our understanding and mastery of materials by various techniques to keep learnt information accessable and maintain it in LTM(memory warehouse) involving Working memory which is memory strore for facts. academic and new learning. The techniques covering how to learn and how to avoid ineffective methods or habits of learning.

It was enlightening to watch these incredibly experienced and talented professionals ""personally"" explain these eyeopening topics in such a simple way in the comfort of my home, or wherever I was.  The videos are short enough so I could advance at any time, but are so compelling, once I started, I found it difficult to stop! Plus, they provide visual aids which make the facts so memorable. The optional interviews are very enriching and inspiring, loved them! The fact of having so much additional bibliography is another big plus; you can go deeper in the subject if you desire to. I learned plenty of new techniques to learn better and reinforced some that I used. I will definitely put everything to use! It was a true delight, thank you Barbara, Terrence and everyone! I will hold this inspiring experience within me for a very long time. Best of luck to all of you!  "

I wish I had had an opportunity to learn about these learning methods while in high school so that I could have used it in college and even throughout my career.  Understanding how neural connections are created and made permanent are important components of learning and retaining all kinds of information we encounter in life.  I've even used these tips to improve my golf swing.  Repetition makes permanent!  In summary, this course provided insight that helped me discover self-destructive mental roadblocks and bad habits that could be addressed once I became aware of these issues.  I now understand that I'm not alone with these issues (procrastination, test taking anxiety, the impostor syndrome, etc....).  I strongly recommend this course for those on a path of self-discovery and personal improvement."
2015-08-24 00:00:00,Olwen J,5.0,0.0,"I thought I would finish this self-paced course in a couple of days, but my 30 second summary of the first week's materials was that learning takes time. So I took the full 4 weeks to complete this course. This course doesn't reveal some new and amazing technique that enabled me to become a walking encyclopedia overnight. In fact I had already heard of all of the techniques. For example, I've tried 30 second summaries before, but I wasn't good at it right away, so I decided the technique didn't work for me. This time I treated the techniques as something I would have to spend time learning how to do, just like any other skill. Because the course became about learning new skills, I really enjoyed it. If I'd just done what I'd always done (take notes and memorize them), then I would have been bored witless, struggled with motivation and procrastination, and dropped out."

Attending this course, I understood why and how my way of learning works. Also, got insights into how I can improve my learning process. I also used the companion textbook which provided lot of information and real-life examples to support the key ideas in the book. I really enjoyed it.
Thanks a lot Prof. Barbara in bringing this course & book.  I understand and appreciate your effort for sharing your own experience in learning  subjects that were alien.Thanks for helping most of us understand better our own learning process.

I spent lots of time studying at school during the past years. But no one teaches me how to learn scientifically and effectively. I found I did waste lots of time before, and previous school life made me feel frustrated. Back, I spent too much time rereading, making notes, and highlighting. And I did not complete the questions after math classes in time. I did not recall the material after class and crammed the material before the exam. These are all my lousy learning habits. It is a life-changing course. I found some qualities that make me different. I decided to change some ineffective learning ways and some ways of thinking. I recommend that everyone should take this before middle/high school or college or from now. Thank you professors

The best online course I've taken so far. This is not an exaggeration. Throughout the course, I truly felt the importance of the material taught and their applicability in my daily life. I've started using the Pomodoro technique (with the help of an app) when tackling projects at work or want to be productive at home (taking an online course, learning some new skills). I also owe it to this class, and this might be a side effect rather than a direct impact, for bringing my brain to a more relaxed mental state. In other words, the topics about focused/diffuse mode and the discussion of thinking patterns provided a much more clear path not only for approaching tasks, but also escaping from that constant loop that eventually leads to a headache. Without going into more details, this is a wonderful class for anyone, anywhere accessible to take. Happy learning!"
2020-06-22 00:00:00,Enya H,5.0,0.0,"This course was absolutely awesome! Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski introduced the information in such a manner that all learning styles had the opportunity to grasp it. It was informative and interesting; pertinent and thought provoking. The quiz after each module was key in helping to chunk the material presented each module. Each module and quiz included a bit of humor, which made the learning experience enjoyable. I'm definitely going to be aware of how I study and strive for maximum efficiency using the techniques taught here. Additionally, I'm going to buy the suggested books so that I can use them to help my math students to better learn and enjoy the topic.  I learned in 4 weeks what I didn't learn during more than 20 years of formal education. Thank you very much Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski!! I rate you both as my favorite professors ever in learning."
2020-04-18 00:00:00,saurabh s,5.0,0.0,"   I signed up for this course with the intention of using it to help me make the most of later courses I'd like to take, but I was shocked at how much of it is applicable in everyday life. I have many projects that I (would have liked) to be working on but had trouble finding the motivation to do so. What I learned here about handling procrastination - the pomodoro technique, focusing on process rather than product, etc - has helped me become both more focused but also helps me allow myself to relax, meaning I'm more ready to take on other projects, positive cycle etc. What I learned about short- and long-term memory, chunking, creating interesting metaphors, and so on, has had a direct impact on my ability to do my job well and commit relevant information to memory quickly. If you are considering taking this course at all, do it. It's quite worth it.

2019-06-30 00:00:00,Bolat,5.0,0.0,"This was the first only course I've completed ever. 
And actually with high grades. The lowest grade I've got is 83%. 
I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their learning, or want to try to experience what online course is, as there is a high probability that you will complete it and get a confidence that you can complete something that requires a systematic approach. 
One of the reasons that this course is easy to complete and learn, because it's not overloaded by heavy readings or so. 
If you decided to take this course, I would recommend to chunk your learning, for example, I did 2 videos each day, so you're not bored or overloaded. Also, it was effective to analyse the script first, make notes and then watch a video of this script. 
Good luck!
And huge thanks to Barbara! Looking forward to see you in Kazakhstan this September!

Professor Barbara Oakley has an easy going, but always professional approach, with a great care for details and a tremendous ability to put them into the big picture and make learning fun and easy! Everything was really well curated and of high quality. Big contributions also come from Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, which talks more about the neurological aspects related to learning. I have learned quite a lot of interesting techniques that I can use to improve the way I study, even if I am at the end of my Ph.D. ! And not only techniques, but also insights on how the brain works and how to relate this to the process of learning. Absolutely suggested to anyone interested in learning deeper and probably faster than before!"
2019-08-27 00:00:00,J. G M,5.0,0.0,"Dr. Barb Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski are two inviduals who have come very far in life regarding academia. They are experts in their fields of study as well as two people who pushed their cognitive abilities to a considerable length.

It is with this knowledge that I can surely recommend anyone to take their course Learning How to Learn. They went through the length of making an easy to follow program capable of teaching anyone in any language more about the process of learning and how to become better at it via practice.

Do away with all preconceived notions of not being smart enough or believing someone is simply born gifted. This course will break those ideas in order to expose the truth - that our brain's intelligence and cognitive abilities are much like any other muscle, thus, it can be strengthened via disciplined training and practice.

You feel you know but when the time to take an examination comes you don't understand anything?

Search no more this course will explain you simply and in a timely manner the reasons why it happens and how to deal with it.  Don't worry, Drs. Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski  will guide you in this journey.
You just need to focus, then relax, focus again, relax, focus,... (This would be explained in the course I promise).

I learned about different modes of thinking and how to use them efficiently, different types of memory and how to learn better and for long term, Chunking, Illusion of competence, and ways to be more productive and learned about procrastination as a habit to deal with it efficiently, test taking techinques and what not!. If you are reading this review and have not joined the course. I would highly recommend you to enroll in this course, its life changing. Without exaggerating, It is the best course i have ever done.

Understanding the physical and mental preparations towards learning are very well explained. How learning takes place and what are those barriers to learning, that need to be avoided, has been explained in detail. Every concept has been explained without  any clutter around it. Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have taken great pain in developing and explaining the various mental tools and their usages, very clearly. I specially liked the parts covering the 'focused and diffused modes', 'chunking', 'memory', 'rebuilding', habits, 'procrastination', the pomodoro technique, 'Einstellung', 'eat your frogs first' etc,

This course helped me retain some of the other courses I am learning about sports coaching, accountancy, finance and management. I was struggling to retain all of it because I was unable to use these lessons (Corona lock down).This course showed me how the brain works with analogies. I have a good plan to study and retain what I learn now. It will also help me reinforce and keep information that I need to do different things (stay healthy, cook, etc.).The second category of value provided by this course is how it helps you create a learning process for yourself that will make your learning deeper, help you keep procrastination at bay and teach you to reduce your dependency on motivation and will power for various projects.It's a life skill.

It was not at all what I expected... to say that 'I learned how to learn' from this course is an understatement. 
Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr.Terry Snejowski (and team) integrate current information, sophisticated concepts, and effective techniques into a simple educational message for a broad audience to understand. 
The tools to gain from this class are universally applicable and will always be useful . The time commitment is light, convenient, and flexible- it works with anyone's schedule.

I’ve gained many valuable insights which I’ve started applying to projects at home and work, and plan to put the techniques to work in upcoming MOOCs. 
The tips on overcoming procrastination are helping me make significant progress in home organization efforts I have been putting off for months - all while listening to the encouraging course lectures online.

The concepts and techniques are useful to become aware of how our brain learns new material, and how we can adopt effective learning strategies in our lives. Although, I am not in school anymore, I was able to incorporate the teachings in my regular schedule like when reading books, viewing videos or taking other online courses. It is not a very demanding course, which makes it an easy recommendation even if you are squeezed for time. Also, it helps that the instructors keep a very motivating atmosphere and are cognizant of participants in all stages of learning difficulties. As a bonus, there are interviews of experts from various different fields and it is great to get another perspective from them on how they manage to learn effectively.  "

As I searched for a course that I wanted to dedicate my time to better myself as a student and individual, I came across this one, and I am very happy and grateful that I did. This is because all throughout, both instructors constructed this course with a very interesting, intriguing and fun foundation. With their guidance, and energetic teaching I was able to grasp at new ways to look and take on my studies. My most valuable take away from this entire course was the pomodoro method, which I now apply to my academics daily, and has so far worked efficiently and has helped me slowly suppress procrastination. I really really recommend this not only to students, but to anyone who finds themselves in need of some self-enriching guidance. "
2020-04-09 00:00:00,Abhinav C,5.0,0.0,"  Great course. I completed it over two years with long breaks in between the sessions. Though I didn't do it deliberately, I think it is better to complete it this way, slowly letting the lessons sink in, instead of finishing in one go. The content delivered is pretty simple but it is something which every person needs to know since improving ourselves is essential for improving our society and these basic lessons can help you learn ANYTHING faster and more thoroughly. The reason this course is so awesome is that deals with a bottleneck in the current generation's personal development process - ie. they know very little about how to learn effectively, and this course deals with it pretty well.Everyone should start this course, and there is a pretty decent chance that with a little drive you'll be able to complete it.Happy learning!

2020-05-08 00:00:00,Gaurab C,5.0,0.0,"This course is really great for the people who don't have habit of learning new things.  This course definitely hep how to deal with more Scientific, Logical, Art, Literature, Technology type of topic. This helps us to get confidence that we can Learn Anything and Everything, it's matter of time some people do it fast and slow. Understanding the context is more important and foundation come with understanding and using best techniques to learn the new things. Metaphors and analogy should be used while learning, in order to shift from to transfer the items from current working memory to Long Term Memory.
We should periodically recall, attend the test, avoid triggers to procrastination and be prepared as well as relaxed before the Final Test. Better to be excited on learning through processes and automatically will get the result."
2015-11-15 00:00:00,Barton C,5.0,0.0,"This course is extremely interesting and useful, regardless of age, profession or future prospects.
I already knew about most of what is covered in it regarding the brain, the techniques and everything, but only superficially. This course goes in-depth on a lot of known things about the brain, procrastination, time management etc. and summarizes it very well, in addition to dispelling false knowledge in the same domains.
The course itself is very well structured and comprises regular quizzes and tests that, although seemingly silly, help a lot in memorizing the contents and realizing how true what is explained is.
It also offers a very wide range of additional material, be it video interviews or further reading, for anyone wanting to dig even deeper on one particular subject.
I personally enjoyed it from the beginning to the end :)

I didn't know much of the stuff in this course even though I am a learner, I love to learn and I'm trying to find every day a way to improve myself. Learning how to learn provides us with both practical and biological explanation about how we do effectively learn about a subject. Moreover, I found the ""extra"" interviews to be very very interesting, I want to thank Barbara Oakley, Terrence Sejnowski, and the whole Leaning how to learn team. You made a great job.

I absolutely loved this course--it's fun, a confidence-booster, and it has completely changed the way I study and think about the world around me. I love that it takes concepts that would normally be intimidating, such as 'neural pathways', and 'diffuse and focus modes', and puts into them simple terms, like ""pin ball paths"" and ""zombies"". I've learned why certain chemicals in the brain react the way they do, and what stimulates them, and how to better plan and learn the subjects I'm taking. This course also has special tips for those learning science, algebra, and languages, as well as how to better prepare for tests, and how to take breaks efficiently. This course works for all ages and levels; middle school to college, and all subjects, from music theory to chemistry. Do yourself a favor and enroll. You will not regret it. "
2019-05-08 00:00:00,Tri,5.0,0.0,"Learning how to learn is a fundamental subject. I would recommend it to everyone who considers themselves a scholar/academic/student of life, take this course if you're pondering about it. Becoming a better learner improves everything you're studying. I wish this course was around when I was in high school/university.
The intro didn't hook me right away like an award winning TV series but it quickly became very interesting.
The course is sectioned into four parts: Introduction, procrastination, memory and renaissance learning (more tips and advice). As a procrastinator, I benefited from this course tremendously. But I enjoyed the entire course not just that section.
I can say with confidence it's helping me with my TAFE studies right now.
Thank you to Barbara, Terrance and Coursera for creating this MOOC.

I'm kinda keen on self-studying and this course help me a lot of things to enhance my self-study ability: using both focused and diffuse modes when studying, practice makes perfect, using pomodoro technique for a specific of time to enhance your focus, time break and sports are also important to enhance your brain's activity, many techniques to avoid procrastination and improve memory... You must figure it out!
The lessons were awesome with many useful information and visual examples with awesome teaching ways of Professor Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski. You will like the way the talk, it's not only about teaching, it's about sharing. I also love the interviews between Professor Barb Oakley with many professional people in their fields, can learn a lot from them."
2020-11-13 00:00:00,Stephanie N,5.0,0.0,"I absolutely loved this course. I truly believe that these techniques should be taught in primary school, I think it would change a lot of lives for the better. I was never taught any of these techniques but I'm 32 y/o so hopefully they do now. I have been working since I (barely) finished High school because I thought that higher education wasn't for me, which might have worked a few generations back. But in order for me to be able to get where I want to be I need to go back to school, so I started this course just to test myself and my own abilities to learn new things. Turns out that I wasn't stupid, I just didn't have the skills I needed to be able to be a good student. Now I actually feel a little excited to go back to school rather than being afraid. Thank you Coursera, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!"
2015-10-30 00:00:00,Ir R,5.0,0.0,"Very clear, crisp teaching. One can see that much effort of thinking and design went into constructing the course.  I especially appreciated the use of illustrations (the zombies, vampire, and such) to illustrate the ideas while creating a powerful (humorous) visual associations with the material covered. The sections were short and concise, making it less threatening to engage, as well as a feeling of accomplishment and progress.  I also liked that the quiz questions weren't about tricking the student; rather, the testing were part of the teaching process.  In short, the teaching method put into practice what is being taught. It was the first Coursera class I've taken, which has been a true positive experience which inspires me to take additional classes, using, of course, the tips and skills I learned in this course."
2020-10-23 00:00:00,JoAnn K,5.0,0.0,"Fantastic course for anyone wanting to learn solid and proven studying techniques. The material was presented in a very easy to understand format. It's a great course for any age group. There are great visuals, analogies, and a lot of humor.  Interviews with industry experts were very informative and interesting. Many techniques and tips for learning are provided along with the science behind them. I find it useful to understand why some things work and others don't and the explanations about how the brain works were especially helpful.  For my final project I prepared a PowerPoint presentation with many of the techniques and tips in the course with my high schooler in mind. He does not know how to study and is not a reader so the quick tips in the slides provide him (I hope!) with the basics to help him get started."
2018-11-11 00:00:00,Sheila B,5.0,0.0,"This was a fantastic course--one that I wish I had taken years ago. The nuns always told me I shouldn't cram for a test, but they never really told me why. Not waiting till the last minute was an admonition right up there with ""Eat everything off your plate"" and ""be nice to your sister."" If I had know that that I would actually learn more, probably study less in the long run and do far better in school if I studied at regular intervals and actually tried to recall the material--as opposed to highlighting text and re-reading chapters--I would be less inclined to put homework and studying off till the last minute. And I would have done far better in school and remembered much more from my classes.  This course is a must for anyone who wants to be a better learner, whether it be in math and science or in the humanities. "
2020-05-06 00:00:00,Mostafa A,5.0,0.0,"I just finished this great course about learning how to learn and finally understood the reason of its great popularity.
    Although the learning process and the tips may seem simple and  logical, but the design of course is outstanding and highly creative. The course applies practically the princibles it conveys already through the  videos which is brilliant. In addition, the instructors teach you why are these ways or tips of learning important through neuroscience and provide you with great amount of resources and research papers that make your subconscious mind more aware about the importance of how you learn the material. 
The course also intends to change your mindset about the importance of continuous learning and exploring your potentials through your whole life.
 For me it was a great and exciting experience."

This course has hit home in many of the problems I've faced throughout my life not only in studying and learning, but in doing the very tasks I consider important on a daily basis.
The material is fun, engaging, intuitive, and above all interesting.
Professor Oakely and Dr. Sejnowski have done a marvelous job producing such a great course, and presented the material in exceptional grace and compassion. 
To say I've enjoyed the journey this course has taken me would be an understatement - it is one of the most important experiences I've ever had.
I cannot thank you enough, and I will be recommending this course to as many people as I can - I believe this course can be timely for anyone, at any age, at any level of education.
A 6 stars out of 5 possible ones for you,
Thank you so very much."

Learning How to Learn is a beginner level study skills course. Its content can be compared to all sorts of text books written for junior year college students to help them put things in order from the beginning. However, this course is informed by most recent neuroscience. What you will hear in the videos is not only practical, but also the simple truth about how your brain works and how you can learn. As a beginner level course, it doesn't take you to the roots of things they teach or any technicality. If you are curious about why and how, you won't find the answers here. But that makes you a specialist, not one of the target audience of the course. In general, Learning How to Learn does an excellent job for its purpose. The course and Barbara Oakley's 2016 book with more elaborate content, are highly recommended.    "

The lessons are practical and useful. 

I see much improvement in my learning abilities & I am more confident now, than before taking this course. 

By adopting the techniques I learned in this class, I am learning new subjects to advance my career. 

I had been working for years and out of college, I had many doubts about my learning abilities, in particular of new subjects.  This course cleared my doubts, dusted off my core abilities. 

Great collaboration of the instructors, Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. 

I am very inspired by Dr. Barbara Oakley.  I have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering. 

This is the BEST value for my money. 

Grateful to Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for putting this invaluable course.  Best Regards. "
2019-12-04 00:00:00,Nghia N,5.0,0.0,"  I first heard about this course through others learning to program. I finally decided to start it, and I'm very glad I did. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski both clearly know what they're talking about and their lessons and information opened my eyes to how to efficiently learn. I will likely have to pour over my notes again and again to make sure I am learning correctly.What I found the most interesting was how sleep rids our brain of metabolic toxins and that there was two modes of thinking: focused and diffused. I believe these will have the most impact in my studies. If anyone is on the fence about taking this course, as long as you are interested in improving then I would suggest taking it. It's free after all!Thank you for making this course, and I'm interested in reading the book as well.Best Regards  "
2019-02-07 00:00:00,David P D,5.0,0.0,The course was absolutely brilliant. It opened my eyes to the problems I had recently encountered with making a career change and learning the subject matter as easily I was used to. The course also provided both easy to implement strategies for learning any type of subject matter as well as backing up those recommended strategies with scientific fact and relatable examples from their personal experiences with learning or by sharing stories about accomplished scholars and scientists who experienced failure and self-doubt on their journey to success. Dr. Oakley and Dr. Senjowski presented the material in a very down to earth but fun and professional manner. I would highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone wanting to learn something new or deepen their learning on topics they are already familiar with .

Given by professor Barbara Oakley, this course not only helped me to improve my learning method but also taught me various things, like various techniques to increase my learning power, memory power, etc. Apart from the course curriculum, what i found most informative were those interview sessions with people, professors from different places. You can gain a whole bucket full of information by watching those interviews and going through the supplement material that Prof. Oakley has included in this course.
I will suggest this course to everyone who are having a problem while learning new things. Great Course by Great Professor. Thanks Prof. Oakley for teaching ""Learning How to Learn""."

Knowing about how our brain works and applying things which doesn't waste our mental energy is the main purpose of this course. All the faculties had really helped me especially Ms. Barbara Oakley. She was very much passionate and was very much focused on getting things understood by the students. 
I personally recommend everyone to watch the optional interviews too as it gives us a whole new perspective and we can learn a lot from it.

Classes were to the point and didn't beat around the bush which is that one feature I always look for in any course. Special thanks for that. I am very much confident that this will help me a lot in my life. Happy Learning."
2022-07-27 00:00:00,Alexandre R,5.0,0.0,"We don't learn to think about our educational system, just to repeat, repeat and by symbiosis we incorporate the information. Coloring, scratching, doodling, I don't remember anything in my learning that actually made sense. At 53 years old, I saw meaning in learning, in relearning and how difficult it is, but not impossible, to review concepts and then learn. I have a degree in mathematics and a lot of what I saw in the course fits perfectly into the mathematics of life. Sometimes we are so skeptical that when we see a paid course with the possibility of being free, we immediately opt for the free one to see what it will do. This course is undoubtedly one that deserves to be paid, not only for the content, for the didactics, but for the sharing of knowledge. Thank you Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski."

At the time of the course, I was being surprised at every part of that course and felt regret for myself for not getting the opportunity to at the earlier stage of my life.
I must have to convey my thanks to my institution ""Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Maritime University, Bangladesh"" for arranging the sponsorship to complete such a wonderful course and the sponsor 'Commonwealth' as well.

Another problems I had, illusions of competence and not taking brakes. Of course, after LH2L, I take brakes and repeat material more frequently to myself. I try to use my diffused mode to recall important information and stick them on my long term memory.

As you mentioned repeatedly during the course, learning is a life-long quest and can be one of the most enriching endeavours if one has the right tools to not only know how and where to acquire knowledge but how to make the learning process fun and memorable. The MOOC and the book offer these tools. I have already sent out links - especially to my son, who loves learning but is at the same time a genius in procrastination :) -, to teachers, friends and students and hope that some of them will get inspired by you, the way you have inspired me. I will definitely follow you on Facebook! All the best and once again: Thank you very much for this wonderful  learning experience!

To overcome this fear I thought it would be helpful to get a deeper understanding of what learning is and how to do it. 
This course has deepened my understanding of learning and gave me valuable tools in how to more effectively approach learning. I also feel like it has changed my perspective on learning to a more healthy one.
In the course there is a deep emphasis on the process instead of the product of learning. Being focused on the process has given me a sense of enjoyment I haven't felt in a very long time. I finished the course in a relatively short time and intent to refer back to it more often to solidify my understanding.
Strongly recommend."

Learning How to Learn gives a solid understanding of how our brain retains and recalls information. The videos will help you to beat procrastination, use your time most efficiently when learning new material, and memorize information in different ways. There are lots of super test-taking tips too! Though not required reading, Barbara Oakley's excellent book, ""A Mind For Numbers"", is a well-written companion for this course. The suggested articles for each week's studies are enlightening and so interesting that you'll read many more than you expected, and come out all the wiser. If want to create a strong foundation for learning new material, this course is a perfect choice."

It tackles the science behind our minds capabilities to retain information. It also focuses on the cognitive and behavioural sides of compelling ourselves to keep learning from the age of 1 to 100. The chapter on procrastination and motivation was extremely useful to me. After decades of struggling with school and career related courses I finally feel that I can recognize the symptoms and correct the negative behaviours that held me back. The video lectures are very informative. Sometimes the subjects are presented with a touch of humour, which helped me remember more then usual. Beware of the Zombies and Vampire bats."

This is an amazing MOOC! 

Although there weren't any ""discoveries of the century"" for me, and most
 of the techniques that are covered in this course I suspected to exist 
or intuitive (kinda) ""knew of"", this course makes it real easy to see 
these techniques, use them to your advantage, and as a result - improve 
your learning and life in general.

By using some of the techniques from this course right from the moment I
 learned them, I moved more easily throughout the course itself, so its 
pretty much self-solving thing!) You just need to start, and then with 
every turn of the wheel it gets easier and more interesting.

Huge thanks to Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowsky for creating 
this MOOC and helping people from around the world to learn how to 
learn!)

I understood the material easily because of her approach to teaching. Just as she suggests that learners use analogies or metaphors, for example, as a method to better understand and remember a concept, she also uses these methods to present the course material.   These methods allowed me to do very well on all the quizzes (which was difficult for me in the past).  I thought I knew a lot about how to learn before taking this course, but I was mistaken and had what the course refers to as ""illusions of competency.""  I now know what to do to be most effective in my future learning endeavors.  It was well worth my time and effort to take this course."

This ""Learning How to Learn"" course is an eye-opener for me as I am able to apply the techniques from the course to help me overcome my learning challenges, such as procrastination, bad learning habit like not recalling or doing spaced repetition, overlearning, too much focus on a minor detailed concept and wasting so much time.  I learned a lot about effective learning techniques, which I have never used or heard of, such as chunking, interleaving, focused mode, diffuse mode, Pomodoro. I am looking forward to applying the knowledge and techniques I learned in this course to help me achieve more and better results in my future learning.

          This is really a best course if you are wishing how to learn! I
 was blocked in many new themes that I was trying to learn and I was 
giving up on many of them because I really didn't  know that I was 
trying by the wrong method!

I'm surprised how most of themes that I'm trying again are flowing well 
after applying some of techniques learned here. The course is very well 
structured and the empathy of the authors makes you learn like you were 
in a class with the best teachers. The bottom of each chapter presents 
links to videos and texts that worth to explore! 

I bought the book ""A Mind for Numbers"" and I have started to read it ...
 it's great and I'm loving! It's wonderful like the course and also a

No, I'm writing this because this course has truly changed my life. Not only in the short term, but clearly in the long term too. I can already see improvements in my university learning with the pomodoro technique, and I already know that I will apply many of the other skills to my learning too. This is the foundation course, the basic introduction course to learning in general. So it's really perfect for anybody who's currently doing learning in any regard whatsoever, be it high school, university, or just personal learning.

they tell you and give you a chance to practice what they told you.   then they give you another chance to practice a little while later, and yet again, much later, etc . . .

But make no mistake, you are in for an amazing journey into understanding the neuroscience of how the human brain operates. The course is kept pretty light and is approachable to anyone over the age of 13 (as per my opinion). The sooner you complete this course in your life, the more you will thank yourself in the future. 
You will start taking a step back and observe and understand the little cues as you learn a new skill or concept. The instructors have done a great job of condensing the latest scientific research for the human brain, into understandable tidbits for people outside the research community. If you are new on coursera or have been on the platform for a while, this should definitely be the next course you take."

Some of the transcript-language, when read without the video, is not really clear, but vague. Those instances , there are quiet a few, took a bunch of guessing, to figure out what the interviewer or guest meant to say. A   L O T  of info material . So,if you are one of us-  creatives / artists, you my find yourself a bit overwhelmed. Just take it easy, pick the info you think you need and complete the course, it will make you A) think a lot more about your children, students and your own learning habits.

The techniques mentioned in this course are really helpful especially the Pomodoro Technique. I just loved it. Got a basic understanding of neuro-scientific perspective of our learning. Optional interview sessions are just the icing on the cake. It's really an opportunity to hear from legend learners and scientists from varying disciplines and geographies. I haven't missed any of those interview sessions. I would say it shouldn't be labelled as 'Optional'. All students of this course should listen to those interviews.
Hats off, Dr.Barb and Dr.Terrence for this wonderful course. Thank you very much for sharing bits of your knowledge for the benefit of us. Waiting to see more courses from this team!!"

I have told so many people about it and shared it with my employer. I started using everything right away in my work. If you have just a few moments in your day, listen to it while you're getting dressed (if you don't have time for the fun videos) and you will absorb much. The bonus material is also excellent. My study skills, testing, anxiety around learning/getting wrong, memory, efficiency (and less procrastination!) and more are all SIGNIFICANTLY better. Barbara is a fun, honest and engaging teacher who comes from her heart. "

I felt like I've heard it all before, especially when discussing particular tools like Pomodoro, but this time something finally clicked with me. I think this course should be taught to children so this helpful behaviours can be enforced in them from young age. I'm starting my own journey now with preparations for different certifications in my own field of work, and I'm eager to see how much better can I do with all those tools given to me by this course.

I have just completed the course ""Learning how to learn"". It gave me a fresh perspective to look at the process of learning in place of the end product. It is astonishing to get a hold over explanations regarding brain functioning which we looked over carelessly. It gave a solid insight over the reasons of brain activity that we are aware of since ages but didn't knew the technicalities behind it. Particularly, the interviews that Barbara conducted with learners and researchers across the world helped significantly.
The mentors: Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley were really helpful with their research and imparted techniques. I would like to especially thank Barbara for her voice through which she made learning simple and enjoyable.

Dr. Barbara Oakley Ma'am is a very kind and friendly person/instructor I have ever met any of my online classes. She made me realize that yes even I can also solve the tougher mathematics sums or any tough exercises, readings, which was quite difficult for me previously. And Dr. Terrence Sejnowsky Sir is an awesome instructor. His learning tips were great to achieve, and also for Dr. Oakley Ma'am. Thank you so much, Ma'am and Sir, for this wonderful course and your instructions.
Overall I loved this course and enjoyed it very much. I'll suggest this course strongly if you guys are suffering from how to learn/ achieve difficult things and how to concentrate on studies."
2015-11-10 00:00:00,Ana P,5.0,0.0,"One word ... FANTASTIC! Thank you Learning how to Learn team for your tremendous effort in making this message available to all. You are clearly passionate about empowering learning and also about teaching. This is the first MOOC that I will complete to the end, it it has given me the courage to expand my horizons and learn something new and/or something scary that I never thought I could possibly do - you don't always have to be a 'natural' at something to learn something new. Thank you for showing the world that anyone can be brilliant by implementing some smart, effective, and efficient strategies. As well as applying a bit of grit. Thank you for teaching us how to learn. A great and highly recommended course for absolutely everyone - because we are all life-long learners. "
2017-01-13 00:00:00,Tiago F,5.0,0.0,"That is an outstanding course! I really learned a lot about how to improve my learning and I am putting this knowledge into practice in many other areas of my life. The distinction of focus mode x diffuse mode helps to understand that learning cannot be an inertial action of only doing the same thing all the time. Variation is extremely important! I also enjoyed a lot the taught techniques like the Pomodoro, which can be life changing, together with spaced learning (I'm using Anki, another course's suggestion), retrieving and interleaving.
It also made me deal much better with procrastination! Thank you very much for such an opportunity. I'll take that for the rest of my life and share this knowledge with friends and relatives, to whom I'm going also to reccomend this course!"
2018-03-20 00:00:00,Tan C,5.0,0.0,"I really like this course and highly evaluate the materials taught by Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski. I actually learn a lot of things in the course and I particularly like Pomodoro technique which helps me deal with procrastination very effectively. I also do understand why we should switch our brain between two modes, say focused mode and diffuse mode, in order to be more productive. I really enjoy this course and would like to share this with my students. I am now an assistant professor in math (I used to be very very bad at math) but I even haven't known how to learn new things effectively until I take this awesome course. I strongly believe that many people would like this course and learn a lot from it. Again, thanks Barb and Terry for making such a wonderful course!    "
2018-01-10 00:00:00,Gokulakannan P,5.0,0.0,Exceptional course. It is thoughtfully designed to help each person / persona associate their learning difficulties / challenges (from past and on going experiences) and take the right course of action. Both Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski were brilliant in delivering their thoughts to make this course a very effective one. I completed this course one and a half years back but did not lose its impact yet. There are many additional resources and very useful interviews of many people exceptional in their fields. I would recommend this course for everyone. I have been getting regular weekly updates regarding this field as part of this course association. Great work. I started Mindshift course hoping that it will bring in a lot of benefits and positive feelings. 
2021-04-19 00:00:00,Pietro S,5.0,0.0,"I had heard a lot about this course and wanted to take it. A good experience.
It has now become a good point of reference when I need to go back to certain sources, since the topics covered are all based on scientific evidence listed in an exhaustive way.
I recommend it to anyone (student or teacher) who has never studied the theme of ""learning how to learn"".
The brain does not come to us with an instruction manual, so everyone is called to build their own. Without a minimum of self-study to learn how to learn, a lot of valuable time is wasted studying inefficiently. There are many teachers who do not know how to guide students to improve themselves.
A small course like this, a few hours a week over a month, can make a difference and change your way of teaching and studying."
2020-09-08 00:00:00,Brenda D B,5.0,0.0,"I really cannot find the words to describe how AMAZING this course is. I'll start by the basics: the topic is quite interesting and the material follows an ideal structure so it is easy to go through the course. Moreover, this course goes far beyond learning for school or university: it offers tools to hugely improve your everyday life! On top of it, the lectures are short, concise and entertaining. The instructors do not only help you lots to understand what they are saying (it's cool how consistent they are by using the very same tips they mention in their lessons), but also they are tremendously charismatic and to me it felt like they really cared about me even if -clearly- they don't even know I exist. I am even sad to have finished the course. Thank you very much!!!"
2019-11-06 00:00:00,Satria S,5.0,0.0,"I strongly believe that almost everyone will benefit greatly by taking this course. I usually don't bother to leave reviews but the course instructors, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, truly deserve credit. I'm just gonna say this... this course will change your life. And I don't say that lightly. I have always thought of myself as a fast and effective learner but even so, this course made me even better so just imagine what it could do to people who think that they are slow learners or who think that they are just not cut out for ""difficult"" subjects such as Maths and Physics. My deepest gratitude goes to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. I wish I could one day meet both of you and thank you personally. From the bottom of my heart, thank you."

Почерпнула для себя огромное количество полезной информации не только из теоретических объяснений, но и из интервью. Очень интересно было узнать, что существует такое понятие, как ""синдром самозванца"", которым я страдаю ( к счастью, не одна и оказывается, есть определенные приемы, как его преодолеть). Очень полезными были советы о том, как писать научные работы и эссе и как научиться задавать вопросы, понять, почему даже в обширных дискуссионных темах вопросы не возникают. Я очень довольна, рекомендую курс всем - и школьникам и студентам и просто всем, кто учит иностранный язык и интересуется саморазвитием. Спасибо! "
2019-12-08 00:00:00,Chintan G,5.0,0.0,"I started taking this course to understand and learn better study techniques for the things I am about to learn going forth. I am a Software Engineer at Google currently & after spending 6 years in my career, I wanted to start re-learning some old concepts and many new things. Being a full-time employee, its necessary to have efficient learning methods at my finger-tips, so I could optimise my work-life-study balance, and this course has definitely provided me with those. Simple things like working a little bit on something daily and using recall over rereading has been super-helpful while even learning new techniques that help me with my daily work. I would definitely recommend this course to every full-time student and anyone who is starting to learn new things."
2017-08-06 00:00:00,Joydip M,5.0,0.0,"to maintain relevancy and continued success in professional world, one needs to be in an environment of continuous learning today. For many of us who are long removed from their college classrooms, this is easier said than done .  Time is restricted, distractions and many and so are responsibilities. This course provides wonderful set of strategies and techniques to maximize and upgrade learning capabilities. From the very basics - like importance of sleep - to more intricate techniques like recall over repetition -  it is helping me unlearn several things and learn new. It also fills me with lot of hope that it is possible for everyone to learn, and learn better ! Terry and Barbara do an amazing job and by the end of the course, have become something of a coach !"

The sooner someone experiences this content in life the better. Ideally covered with spaced repetition (easter egg right here) over our childhood and teenagehood years. What you are you going to get from this course are extremely valuable actionable insights on how to learn ANYTHING as effectively as possible according to Science. Since learning new things is one of the best things in life (am I right?!), it really does not get any better than this. I would never be able to express my gratitude towards Barb and Terry for taking the time and effort to build this precious material and make it easily accessible. Highly recommended!"
2019-03-10 00:00:00,Dr. J L,5.0,0.0,"This course was quite interesting and had a lot of useful ideas.  I believe that the techiques taught here would definitely be beneficial for many subjects.  I am a physicican and recognize that many of the areas of medicine may require pure memory and often ""understanding"" is not really part of the learning.  But the ideas behind making up crazy sentences to help jog your memory of lists is definitely something that I have used and have found very useful.  Although I completed school many years ago,  I still refer to some of those ""crazy sentences"" to jog my memory when necessary.  I enjoyed taking this course and I thought the instructors were very good.  I wish I could have taken this course many years ago when it could have made medical school a bit easier."
2019-02-13 00:00:00,Ruslan ,5.0,0.0,"This course should be compulsory in all areas of education from school to universities. Barbaba Oakley is a gifted teacher, mentor and  a great motivator. I always had a trap of ""talent and passion"" stereotype and now(thanks to this course) it changed. Now i know that there is such thing as neuroplasticity and giving a time to hard work and practice we can change our ""talents"" and ""passions"". I always hated this fancy ""find your passion"" credo and thanks to this course the scientific research proved that it it's a wrong approach. If you are not good at math, logic, or drawing - maybe you will not become Einstein, Bill Gates or Leonardado Da Vinci. But you definitely can master the foundation of this sciences(and far more)  even without having a natural talent. "
2018-02-22 00:00:00,Morgen C,5.0,0.0,"Not only did this course give me very practical strategies to more effectively learn as an adult (rather than beating my head against a wall), but it gave me new insights into brain development and learning strategies for my classrooms of younger students. 
Barbara is an incredibly engaging speaker who breaks down concepts into easily processed segments...of course, for a scholar who dedicates herself to learning about learning, she is very easy to learn from! Terry is one of the most renowned neuroscientists in the world but surprisingly manages to translate his research into layman's terms without losing his enthusiasm.
I wouldn't mind retaking this course annually to brush up on the scientific research and dig more thoroughly into the supplemental materials!

As someone who recently finished my undergrad I wish I had taken this class earlier in my academic career. The clear connection between brain science and learning techniques truly illuminated for myself the flaws in my learning practices. However, the information also confirmed for me the strategies I was doing right in my learning and helped grow confidence in my learning style. I know the strategies i've learned in this course will help me learn the new skills I need to achieve personal growth and advance my career. Thank you Barbara Oakley for your enthusiasm and wonderful lectures, I looking forward to utilizing this knowledge for life-long learning.

Now that I've completed it and will then try to finally go through ""Mind for numbers"", recalling information and creating notes as I did for this course (I've spent almost double the time, but it's worth it).
L​earn how to learn to spend less time studying and get more hours on your  hobbies and self-improvement. Learn mnemonics and be even more productive. Don't get productivity guru's advices close to heart, just use them as an advice. Be save, love each other, bye!"

The only real, but minor issue I had with with this course was the static noise from the speaker's microphone and at some other times it either popped or it was a tad quiet, forcing me to max out the volume slider to 100% so I can hear what she is talking about.
Other than that, this was an amazing course and I highly recommend it to people who want to change their perception of learning as a whole but they lack the foundations or people to fill them in. This course did exactly in a very nice and friendly way, especially with the tests."

This course has been and will continue to be a fundamental foundation in my learning, not only for 100 Devs, but in my many other interests! This course needs to be apart of the educational systems curriculum for students, through every education level. Barbara Oakley is a phenomenal professor and explains complex brain functions in a way that supports real results towards our success in learning, but also understanding more about how incredible our brains really are. That being said, I enjoyed videos that mentioned Neurodiversity. This was especially helpful for me being neurodivergent myself, and allowed me to find more joy and confidence in learning new and challenging subjects!

2015-08-23 00:00:00,Dana S,5.0,0.0,"This course rocks!
You are thought many different learning techniques and get to know how your brain works in a simple way without too much background information. It's just the right amount of input to get a feeling for it. You can apply this knowledge to every kind of subject. The short videos are easy to persuade yourself to get started. Once started you want to see another one! The lecturers have prepared their videos perfectly and after some videos you feel a little bit connected to them. They are able to do the seemingly unmakeable: Keep you motivated! If I feel myself unmotivated to study for my exam, first of all I watch one of these video sequences and promptly I am motivated again. 

Thanks a lot for putting this course online! 
I love your work."

It has also shown me that in life we all face hardships of not dissimilar challenges and it depends on us to decipher the do's and don'ts for us to move on and do better the next time or get something going for good or even change something profoundly important in our lives. 
I loved the short lessons that I could listen to or read in my own time and I loved Barbara Oakley's soft voice explaining the subject in such detail and very often with metaphors. The quizzes after each lesson were set with a sense of humour and this made the whole thing actual fun.  
I would thoroughly recommend this course to anyone. Thank you 'Learning How to Learn'!

During this session I learnt so many things which I was not aware of. For example our brain has two modes of learning focus and diffuse modes, about procrastinating, that it is  when we skip some problems when we feel it hard , about rereading, that it is not the correct way of learning. Recall the understangs, deliberatly practicing and repetitions are the correct way to  learn and memorize. Chunking was so new to me. I never heard about it. The course was little difficult for me. However, I finished it successfully.  I am happy that I got opportunity to improve and enhance my knowledge regarding how to learn.  Thank you so much."

The solid evidence more than anything here is the completed informs from Coursera and I decide to write the review for this course to inform people, who are trying to find out the techniques to learn more effectively and productively, this course is definitely the great start.

I returned to finish it up – to review what I learned and to ""learn the rest"" – in early April 2018. I had purchased the book ""A Mind for Numbers"" and read it back in 2014. The book is awesome but taking the class and doing the exercises online plus submitting the assignments really reinforced my learning of the key concepts and gave me a start for where to dig deeper. Redoing this class from start to finish (and not simply picking up where I left off) has armed me to face my new challenges. The class is set up in such a way that you can follow it from most anywhere and can do the assignments at your convenience. It is well worth the time spent on it."

This course is comprehensive and very well put together. Easy to follow and most importantly the repetition of learned topics were reoccuring throughout the course in different chapters, as well as the tests which really helped the information to sink in without even trying to do anything extra after completing each chapter and taking the test. 
In addition, this course has great references and sources throughout the course that I could not ignore by not writing some of the authors names down in my personal list for future reading material.

I've gained a better understanding on the the learning process, how the brain works on keeping the information, what are the most common errors or obstacle on learning something new and some useful habit or tricks to learn in a more fruitful fashion. I've really appreciate the competence and teach style of the two teachers which I'd like to thank for their work. I strongly recommend this course, especially for students in high school and University because it contains helpful information on how to be more proficient in text or exams. The course could seem less apt for workers and employees, but for someone who wants to get better in what he does and fails on regular basis, this should be a great starting point. "

I've been using both Pomodoros: one at work and one at home. My Memory Palace is set with 63 places in which I can place something I want to remember. I'm so excited to use this daily. Although, I haven't mastered everything, I remind myself that I'm forming a habit and there will be days like this and I shouldn't beat myself up when I don't do this well.

El contenido es claro, actual y pertinente; y la calidad de los videos es muy buena. Las exposiciones de la Doctora Bárbara son excelentes y divertidas, lo cual favorece el aprendizaje. Lo más relevante para mí fue entender el por qué de la procrastinación y cómo evitarla, ya que por años había estado postergando el estudio del inglés y no entendía el por qué de mi rechazo a este idioma. Desde que inicié el curso estoy aplicando la técnica del Pomodoro y estoy feliz porque la sensación de frustración que sentía cada vez que pensaba en que tenía ""una tarea pendiente"" se ha ido diluyendo conforme pasan los días.

Thanks authors for creating this course, which both encourages to start learning more on how memory works and equips with powerful knowledge on how to learn. Learning how to learn helped me realize that this is not the product that keep me at my job, but the process—doing my job in English, my second language lifelong mastering I enjoy. What really struck me was that I realised why I was bad at math in school, as Ms. Oakley said, I was ""one of those people who can't hold a lot in mind at once, you lose focus and start daydreaming in lectures and have to get to some place quiet to focus so you can use your working memory to its maximum, well welcome to the clan of the creative.""

I also always asked myself questions about what thinking and how my brain works, especially as I try to reflect on my practice and analyze my own way of learning.
This course answered all of these questions and more. She introduced me to the wonderful world of the brain and the latest discoveries in neuroscience, and the wonderful Dr. Barbara Wakley and Dr. Lawrence Signovsky provided me with a set of advice and guidance to make my learning improve dramatically.

I have been recommending this course and sharing information from it to many colleagues and also using it to help support my daughter with her studies (I can't guarantee all teens will respond so well to saying 'it is scientifically proven that this is the best way to do it' as a way to change their study approach, but it works for her!).

 In this course, all aspects of learning have been covered in a very  interesting and simple way. you will learn more about how your brain  works, how your memory is going on and how you can improve it. You will  learn very useful studying techniques that will help you learn more  effectively like chunking, pomodoro technique, Anki flashcards, spaced  repetition, recall, frequent testing and To-Do list. You will also learn  about how to overcome the enemy of all of us, procrastination,.
 Finally, I advice everyone taking the course to watch the optional  interviews. They are really very helpful and give us true stories from  which we can learn alot.

2021-03-17 00:00:00,Philip C L,5.0,0.0,"This is a good course.  It points out some of the deficiencies in American schools and it fills a void at least in the American educational system.  Some of the discussion on the brain is not germane to the topic because we do not have to know the precise location of any brain function to understand how to use our brains to be better learners.  Furthermore, we are probably wrong about everything we think we know about the physical brain.  Some of the information on the brain presented herein has already been debunked by more recent research published after this class was made.  In spite of these and other mild shortcomings, there is some really great information in the course that makes the effort to complete it, worthwhile.  "

It gives various techniques to improves your Learning ability. To name a few, shifting from Focus mode to diffused mode is one of the effective way of Learning Hard Concepts. Pomodoro Technique is the best to avoid procrastination. Importance of Building a chunk by giving Focus attention, Understanding basic concept, practising and repeating.

I am one of the students of your “learning how to learn” course in the “coursera” platform. I am writing to tell you: THANK YOU, a BIG THANK YOU, thank you to you and your colleague Doctor Terrence Sejnowski, and your “COURSERA” team. Thank you for your generosity, your caring attitude and your ability to share your knowledge about learning and how to make it more effective.

I am now a retiree from secondary education in Morocco, I was a teacher of life and earth sciences, your course made me aware of my mistakes and my discomforts of my learning, when I was pupil and even teacher. I am very grateful doctor. Thank you very much, you are lovely and spotless. Thank you so much."

I like the fact that informations on which the course is based on, are really up-to-date. And last but not least, I grow really fond of dr.

I course that I personally loved a lot and I would definitely recommend it to everyone, doesn't matter what your age is and in which field you are working. Learning is something you can do anytime and this course actually guides you on how to learn anything whether new or old in an effective way and for a lifetime.
Last but not the least, I would thank the professors of this course for making such a wonderful, enjoyable, interesting, and loving content.
Thank you to the Coursera team for providing it for free."

I am a teacher and a learner, so I took this course because I wanted to understand more about learning so I can also teach better. I do not regret my decision. I even am thankful that I stumbled upon this course on Coursera. The materials explained are to-the-point and helpful! Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski successfully explain the materials very well that I can understand everything, including the very scientific ones. Also, they deliver the materials with calming voices and smiles! I really recommend this course and I am planning to share about what I learned here to my colleagues. Thank you!"
2018-12-18 00:00:00,Sai C A,5.0,0.0,"  The world needs more Barbara Oakleys. Fantastic course and definitely a recommendation to anyone interested in taking any courses online. The material was amazing and wholesome enough to achieve the purpose, and Mrs Barbara's teaching style, passion and her enthusiasm moved my heart. I'm changed in the way I view learning now and I feel more ready to approach it. Her efforts in compiling this comprehensive information and additional interviews and reading/video materials were just too good.  Dr Terrence was amazing and I loved everything he had to say, both together we're able to take a wholesome approach to tackling so many issues. Thank you so much for your efforts, I bet there are too many that feel the same as I do. "
2019-06-22 00:00:00,Jennine,5.0,0.0,"I am beyond grateful to get to learn Learning How to Learn. It has totally changed my approach towards learning. The course has given me the opportunity to revise my learning method, to know what i might have been doing wrong, to know what and how i can do better from now onwards, to know why i always procastinate, to also trust my belief system that progress takes patience, to be mindful and aware of the actions i take and the emotions i choose. I love the additional videos interviews that comes along at the end of every week's lessons. The interviews often gives me many AH-HA moments and inspirations which left me to many self-reflections. Thank you very much. You have made a person better and happier than yesterday."
2016-10-23 00:00:00,Michael F d C,5.0,0.0,"A very insightful course. The simplicity of the material covered might inspire some to quickly abandon this course on the grounds of ""common sense"", but I would recommend to these individuals that although the concepts and techniques are easy to grasp and execute, they are nonetheless powerful, and worth investing some time to understanding why they work and how to use them in your own educational endeavors.
This course offers students a digestible collection of concepts and tools to tackle those ubiquitous evils which students are all too aware of: self-doubt and procrastination. If you are looking to take a first step in conquering these internal demons, I would recommend this course as the first step in your journey."
2020-06-11 00:00:00,Deepak V,5.0,0.0,"First of all many thanks to Barb & Terry for having wonderful session on a great topic. I must appreciate your concept of shifting from focus mode to diffuse mode. Explanation more neural scientifically by Dr. Terry also helped to understand how our brain works and what are different i would say component or section. I like most which is the Pomodoro technique of 25 min focused study then relax, this would personally help me to fridge focus and overcome from procrastination. I must also mention about recall and test technique which can also be very good option of memorizing the stuff rather than reading upside down continuously. Once again thanks a lot! last but not least your interviews with expert were also awesome!"
2019-02-28 00:00:00,Enrico G,5.0,0.0,"This course is 100% useful to improve or add or change your learning methods. The course structure is clear and step by step every milestone aquired, is always recalled by some test so that it is more easy to memorize...in the ""long term memory"" :-D 
Every concept is explained in a simple and flowing way, even when it goes a little bit deeper in a matter.
Personally, i already knew about some of these ones, but i have realized that until now i did not use them almost ever; so the point is that recalling them through this course make an huge impact on you to start try them and then effectively start to use them. And since when you start to use them you will learn and memorize more easily and in depth.

Kind regards.

2021-04-12 00:00:00,Nguyen N,5.0,0.0,"I was a bad student before I kind of know-how to learn. But then I recognized that I couldn't remember or use effectively what I'd learned. I ended up procrastinating so many times, felt uncomfortable with learning new things even I definitely know that I shouldn't. Now, thanks to this course, I know why I was like that, how my mind works, and I am not alone struggling for learning. I manage to put my reward and quit working time seriously, take time to slowly recognize and react with my habit cues, using Pomodoro and recall, etc (trying to apply everything this course provided :) ). This course opens my eyes, thank you so much again, and I recommend this course to everyone that you will take a huge advantage from. "
2016-08-29 00:00:00,Alexander S,5.0,0.0,"Every one of us finished school, probably a higher school, some courses, so we all are well sure that we know how to learn. So I did not expect much from this course.
So I was very surprised how well it turned out to be. It explains reasons and mechanisms behind our well-known way of learning, so some boring or irritating things like rehearsal, or tests in the middle of a class start making sense.
I think, I became a better doer after this course. It teaches how to avoid procrastination, how to make skills and knowledge stick, and how to master things you never consider as masterable.
Also, organizers have one or two nice tricks up their sleeves to make you pass the course even if you want to slack on the last moment."
2020-03-27 00:00:00,Peter D M  S,5.0,0.0,"I wish I'd known this much about how to learn effectively earlier in my life. Just think how much more I'd know right now! This course is a real eye-opener. Learning new stuff will never be a problem ever again! Barbara Oakley is so enthusiastic and makes everything so simple, that she sweeps you up with her enthusiasm. The process of learning becomes a fascinating subject in itself. I couldn't recommend this course too highly. It's been a real pleasure. But not just pleasurable. I've come away with learning insights and techniques that will help me to increase my capacity for future learning,  that in turn will hopefully make me a more rounded individual. And, at my age, what could be a better ambition than that?"
2018-06-17 00:00:00,Aamad A,5.0,0.0,"Honestly, I never write reviews and i'm not some bot that also tells people that, ""I never write reviews."" But god damn, this course was awesome. Partially biased opinion because this was my 1st Coursera course, but I took it very seriously and tried to learn as best as I could. The lessons and insights that were shared in this course are remarkable for someone that is passionate about learning. I enjoyed the videos, the interviews, and the additional readings. The course offered tons and tons of material and resources to further educate your learning abilities. This is a great course for anyone that takes a passion in learning, trying to become the best version of themselves, and values productivity of your time."
2020-11-11 00:00:00,Joanna L,5.0,0.0,"  This course is easy and fun. You can choose to not do the Honors projects for the basic certificate, but those projects are not too difficult anyway so you might as well do them. I learned a lot about myself and had a lot of fun at the same time. I found it great that I applied a lot of what I learned in this course by simply working on completing the final project. Ahh, I feel like I relived my university days, both the good (learning a new software) and bad (still some procrastination and cramming!).I highly recommend taking this course. The instructors took great pains to make this course easy to digest and really helps the learners to practice what they learn. I hope you have fun with it, and happy learning!  "
2020-06-10 00:00:00,Cat,5.0,0.0,"This course provides excellent insight into the mechanisms of learning and how they can be harnessed by students who want to get the most out of their study time. The lectures provide useful and practical tools for breaking down complex concepts so they can be more easily mastered, including chunking, metaphor and analogy, story-telling, spaced repetition, recall, memory palaces, and many more. The course also covers tools for overcoming procrastination and test anxiety. 
Additionally, many great resources are provided for those who are curious and want to delve deeper into the science behind the concepts described in the lectures, along with inspirational and informative interviews with successful professionals. "
2020-06-03 00:00:00,Anirudh S R,5.0,0.0,"  To all the students pursuing any career of their choice, this Course 'Learning How to Learn' will provide you insight on your habits, studying methodologies from a neurological perspective without using any scary too-scientific terms. This course does not talk about a specific discipline, engineering or medical or literature but the concept and habit of learning as a whole. This course will NOT make you the class topper but it will ensure that you understand how to become one! Along with other core-specific courses, this is a must try and it is time efficient, assignments are easy and can be completed well within 30 minutes. I hope you try this course as it will NOT disappoint you. Learn, Understand and Apply.  "
2016-11-05 00:00:00,dboskma,5.0,0.0,"I wish I could have done this course when I just started secondary school. Because I'm relatively intelligent I had no trouble in secondary school, I just didn't bother with homework, but I could have really made it all even easier on myself had I had the information that i learned in this course. Now I am doing some marketing courses and when I just started doing them I was struggling. Then I ran into this course, figured it couldn't hurt and since my marketing courses have become so much easier to learn. No cramming, but pomodoro's. Learned how to deal with procrastination and all kinds of stuff. I have actually told most of my friend to go do this course as I think it is that awesome! So highly recommended!"
2022-02-19 00:00:00,O T,5.0,0.0,Ce cours aurait dû être enseigné dès le primaire même de façon simplifié. Quand je pense à tout le temps que j'ai perdu pensant être entrain d'étudier... J'aurais aimé connaître toutes ces méthodes plus tôt. Mais il n'est jamais trop tard. Je suis énormément heureuse d'avoir pris ce cours et de l'avoi rsuivi jusqu'au bout en moins d'une semaine tellement je me rendais compte qu'il s'appliquait à à moi et à tellement de personnes dans mon entourage. J'ai déjè commencé à en parler à mon entourage. Malheureusement beaucoup pensent que c'est juste une autre arnaque et qu'ils n'y apprendront rien. MAis je le dis j'ai tellement appris et je suis déjà entrain de l'appliquer dans différents aspects de mon éducation.

Thank you ever so much for putting the course together and offering it to us all 'out there!' I really appreciate it.
You have been outstanding communicators! The clarity with which you have explained 'what's under our neural hood', has allowed me to grasp it - I really get it! I've been passing on the nuggets to my pre-teenage daughter along the way too and she's been benefiting from it each week, little by little. It's great stuff.
I realise it's only an illusion, but I have been seeing you every week for some time now, and each time I learnt something new and interesting, and so I have grown to like to loads so - I will miss you!! :)
With very many thanks and warmest wishes

I have learnt many new things on this subject which I will be using in my classes as well as my personal learning. According to me, every teacher must go through this course. This is being given for ""Free"". There should be no more excuses. By gaining knowledge shared here, you will learn better and help others to learn better. By using the tips, you will reduce the time you spend in learning while improving the quality of your learning. Every student needs to understand the ""Process"" of learning, so that they can master what ever they wish to learn.Thanks to each person who has made this course possible. May God bless all of you with abundance.  "

Is not about strength, or having time. Is about knowing the process of learning and metacognition. I don't even started to use this knowledge in my everyday life, I´m so excited because I expect finally finish my degree and acquire many other skills. With a few principles, that are so easy to follow, we can apply to everything we desire to achieve or learn. My only regret is that I didn't take this course before. This should be enough to improve quality of life of anyone. I'm so grateful!"
2020-12-15 00:00:00,Radha S,5.0,0.0,"This was an incredibly useful course.  It has equipped me with practical tools and learning strategies that I can easily incorporate in my everyday life.  In fact, having implemented a few of the techniques taught in the course, I can already find a better version of myself emerging slowly!
What makes this course so impactful is the convincing manner in which the  process of learning is explained. l especially loved Prof Barbara Oakley's easy-to-follow pace, and the interviews with Dr Brent, Dr Felder, Keith Devlin and Scott Young. 
 I am extremely grateful to Prof Oakley and Prof Sejnowski for putting together this invaluable course.  I highly recommended it for all those who want to become better learners!"
2016-01-21 00:00:00,Thinh P,5.0,0.0,"This course is extremely helpful! Ironically, I started the course when I just graduated from college. I found out that I have been using inefficient techniques to study all my years in school (e.g. using mere will power to force myself into problem solving, studying long sessions without taking breaks, falling into the trap of procrastination, etc.) This course has provided me with many perspectives in studying, and they are so convincing since they are backed up by evidences from neuroscience. The course is full of to-the-point tips and helpful advice, with a minimal level of technical details (just enough for a general audience).

Many thanks to the team they created this course! Happy learning, everyone!"

Moreover, one can get to learn so many new and interesting facts of the brain, the course is also involved in brain science which is really important to understand, in order to be able to create a good and realistic learning technique for oneself. I truly appreciate the faculty and the team members involved in conceptualizing and presenting this very amazing and helpful course for us students and truly making us learn how to learn!"

I gained a lot of good knowledge, tips, tricks, and experiences during the course, and also, I have been applying it to my study every day effectively. From the neuroscience perspective, I understand more deeply about my weaknesses that I was not able to call out its names exactly and spent many years struggling with them.  As a result, I feel more confident when I figured out what procrastination is, how to change my habit, Serependity Law, and so on. I will soon be back to school to continue my learning journey, and also, I wish I could share with others everything I learned from this course.
My gratitude,

It is built in an outstanding way, so it is suitable for different age groups
with different intellectual levels. 
Although I would have liked to see more practical explanations regarding the ways one

every minute of this course.
Barbara

To establish a concrete example,  just the idea of modes of thinking and the importance of alternating them to access more of my own cognitive machinery to help me to solve problems is on its own enough to say that doing this MOOC was time well spent. By the way, i plan to redo the course later to better chunk the presented concepts and confront them with the mental images that I've created of them when introspecting between lessons. Many thanks for the shared knowledge, and I've already started reading the Mind for Numbers book influenced by this journey."
2015-12-05 00:00:00,Nada Z,5.0,0.0,"This is an extremely useful course. I recommend it for everyone, no matter your level of education or indeed your age. I think this course should be mandatory for both high school students and their parents. The main reason being so that students can master these skills early in their years and both parents and students understand, in particular, the value of exercise and sleep in learning. Thank you to all those people who put together this course. Although Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski are the faces of this course, I know there were many more involved in the conceptualisation and building of this course. Thank you for making it a MOOC and thank you for such a wonderful clear format that was easy to follow. "

She has a gentle clear approach and a warm and encouraging nature. Thank you to everyone involved, but an especially BIG THANK YOU TO BARBARA.

important information to the comprehension about learning process. The interviews
are interesting, I loved each piece of advices given by the professors and the specialists,

I've learnt new perspectives of how our brains work, and I look forward to apply methods for learning more effectively like the Pomodoro, shifting between focused and diffused mode, etc. It's been a real pleasure to learn while enjoying the interesting puns and illustrations during the videos and in the tests. I encourage anyone to take up this course with an open mind, whether you are studying or working. Also felt inspired by Barbara's anecdote of her own experiences of learning and career, it made me think that I can learn things I'm not naturally good at. Thank you for teaching us how to learn better!"
2019-07-14 00:00:00,Viktoriia N,5.0,0.0,"  Everybody needs to complete this extremely helpful course, because it changes our understanding of learning. I never thought that these 4 weeks would give me loads of interesting information about my brain's work and how to learn properly. I understood that all of us usually try to trick ourselves in learning, like ""Oh, yeah, I already know that"" or ""Recalling is useless, it's such a waste of time"" and so on, but we can avoid such stupid excuses and start to gain real knowledge)) I was especially amazed by the story of Barbara Oakley's career path, she was a real motivator for me during all that time. This course is worth your time, so you can master any subject in the world!!!Thank you so much!!!  "
2016-02-06 00:00:00,Robert B,5.0,0.0,"I learned sooooooo many actionable techniques, strategies and concepts that really works if you implement them. One or two tactics in this course I heard about through the accelerated learning grapevine over the years, but here the techniques are backed by credible research, giving me more confidence to apply them consistently.
I was initially concerned this course was going to be full of more dry theory than practical application, that I almost skipped it. Very glad I didn't. Each module succeeds in being  engaging and informative in ways that can be applied immediately to one's learning projects for better results or to a less stressful path to the same results....excellence. 

Highly Recommended. "
2020-04-29 00:00:00,Mariana L d B e L B S,5.0,0.0,The course material is great and concepts are awesome. I really enjoyed the video lectures and all the techniques that I learned. The teachers explain everything in an interesting away that allows us to retain our attention. I believe that many concepts I learned will be very helpfull in my future and will allow me change for the better. I already tried to implement some techniques while I was attending the course. I already started to use the Pomodoro clock and how happy I was to check this as a great productivity toll. The course offers a great amount of optional sources of information like more readings and great interviews of special guests. Thank you! I really enjoyed to learn how to learn!
2017-04-21 00:00:00,Aaron R,5.0,0.0,"Awesome, Mind expanding and contracting! This course will show you how to turn your mind inside out, upside down, and unlock the keys to transforming yourself in ways you have never imagined. I recommend this course to at least one person a day, and to anyone who wants to become a better student in school or of life. Thank you to Dr Oakley, and her team at Coursera. Applying the principals of procrastination, and understanding to the ways my eating habits were influenced by  the insular cortex and the process of replacing pain with pleasure helped me stop drinking coffee and alcohol, cut down on ""comfort foods"" like carbs, and meat, and lose 25 pounds within three weeks of completing the course."

This class did much to confirm that as a trained musician, I've learned how to learn at a very early age. Also, I've had some great teachers along the way that taught me that the best teacher is one that teaches a student how to learn on their own. Grateful for taking notes once again and doing little quizzes. I also enjoyed the chance to do a little writing for this class, something I don't get to do in much in my normal life. Looking very much to picking some other classes to attend virtually while holed up with this pandemic. What a great gift!"

In my job, I'm constantly learning new things as I work with teams on diverse topics in health and education. While taking the course, I was also writing podcast scripts (for my job) on health and wellness in schools and in the workplace, and I found myself writing them in Barb's voice--kind, pleasant, curious, encouraging. The depth and breadth of this course far exceeded my expectations. I was never bored, and the content was so rich that not a single reading or video felt like a waste of time. I could tell it was a labor of love. Bravo! "
2019-12-21 00:00:00,Jens G,5.0,0.0,"I wish I knew about this before i started to study in University. This is a great starting course no matter your discipline that you are interested in. 
This might be the most self improving and valuable course! But you need to have the dedication to stick with this course. I expect that younger people wont have the discipline or interest in this topic even tough it is very important. 
If you are like me and studied a couple of years you will recognize your mistaken learning strategies, which is great so you can substantially improve future learning and it makes learning more fun!
Learning is not as easy to understand as it might seem. You need to bring some reflection time with you and patience."
2020-08-10 00:00:00,Gira,5.0,0.0,"El curso has sido muy bueno y facil de entender. Barbara and Terry explican conceptos que aunque tan odvios hacen que el aprendizaje se haga mas facil y efectivo. Un tema que debiera ensenarse en la education media y en la universidad cuando tenemos que estudiar en forma rapida y efectiva.   El curso me hizo recordar mucho mis tiempos de Universidad cuando debido a poco apoyo familiar y estudiantil perdi un tiempo valioso estudiando de la forma incorrecta. Ahora entiendo mucho mas lo que realmente ayuda en el aprendizaje y les he mencionado esto a mis hijas para que puedan tener un proceso de aprendizaje mas efectivo y duradero.
Realmente he disfrutado este curso y la forma como esta disenado. "

2020-06-01 00:00:00,Madhav,5.0,0.0,"What I learned from this course will go a long way in my life. The course was not about tricks and hacks to learn. It was about the art of learning and how to not get frustrated when things don't go as you intended. That process is more important than the product.Dr.Barbara Oakley has a very motivating, warm, and charming personality. Her way of teaching is so visual and full of analogies and metaphors, it is like she practiced what she preached.One more bonus part of the course is that Dr.Barbara Oakley interviews some really renowned and talented people who openly share their experiences.I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is into learning and wants to retain that knowledge."
2021-04-08 00:00:00,Hajj W,5.0,0.0,"This course offers knowledge comparable to ""How To Win Friends And Influence People"" in terms of power, but focused on lifelong learning. The instructors lead by example as they apply the very techniques they teach in this course, making the content of this course exceptionally easy to assimilate. At the same time, its value is not diminished: the knowledge offered by this course is applicable from elementary school all the way to graduate school and beyond, and is poised to serve its students for the rest of their careers. Due to the importance of learning in the modern world, Barbara Oakley could be the single greatest contributor toward the progress of humanity in the foreseeable future."
2020-04-28 00:00:00,Mustafa S A,5.0,0.0,"This is the type of course that all universities or high schools should assure that their students take before any specialized courses. I hope I had this course when I was at university. I am sure it would help me a lot to achieve more than what I already did. The best thing about this course that I feel that it speaks about my inner me. It knew the tricks I did to cheat myself and how I fulfilled myself falsely without gaining the full benefits I planned to gain. It also interprets why I didn't achieve the targets I planned to achieve. Finally, I recommend this course for everybody want to well manage his life, because our lives are a big test in which we need to pass it with high grades."
2022-04-11 00:00:00,Leroy H,5.0,0.0,"I suffer from severe ADHD. I came into this class expecting the same boring and uninspirational time management advice I've run accross many times before. I was wrong. They un-blinded me with science! More seriously though, the course was engaging and informative. Its well to know how, but to know why is what makes the difference for me.
While this course will literally help anyone trying to learn anything, the techniques involved are extremely useful for overcoming some side effects of ADHD.  I honestly feel that this course may be a life changer. Highly recommend for anyone, but especially someone looking to understand and change certain behaviors that are commonplace for people like me."
2020-04-15 00:00:00,Vikrum,5.0,0.0,"Incredible. I learnt so much in such a short amount of time. What you learn is super easy to apply and very relevant to every day life and learning. The analogies aid understanding and there are plenty of examples too. The tips are concise, well explained and helpful and I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn better, do better in tests, or just generally be more aware of learning methods and ways to stop procrastination etc. Learning how to learn is a beneficial course and I will be implementing the key ideas in my learning. It is also a great way to spend time (I started the course due to the Coronavirus quarantine), and is much more useful than Netflix!!"
2019-10-29 00:00:00,Jason J ,5.0,0.0,"  They should teach this in schools. Meta learning has been of great interest to me for the past several years and this course has offered many fresh insights and techniques I've never heard of before. What the two hosts may lack in public speaking ability they more than make up for with their broad, detailed knowledge and genuine passion for teaching others the wonderful art and science of meta learning. I bought a certificate not because I wanted to frame my completion of this course on my wall but because I felt guilty taking this course for free. Highly recommended regardless of your occupation or IQ, I honestly believe anyone can benefit from the ideas and techniques discussed herein.  "
2019-04-08 00:00:00,Kevin M,5.0,0.0,"
Great course. It's simple and straight to the point.

This is especially valuable to anyone just entering college or currently
 in college. Wish I knew a lot of these tricks and hacks and the general
 understanding of how the brain works back when I was still grinding 
through 50 topics a week.

As an upper 20-something, the most useful parts of this course are the 
videos that describe the fundamentals of how our brains work and getting
 through procrastination. Knowing how the diffuse mode works is HUGE. 
Taking rests are IMPORTANT and I never really thought that it so 
important. I just kind of had a ""feeling"" overtime. 

This course seriously changed my day-to-day learning. For real.

Creo que debería de hacer mucho más cursos de estos. Los Directores del curso son muy amables, hablan de forma fluida y  entendible (en el idioma original) y queda muy claro. Los exámenes no son difíciles, y son excelentes las preguntas posteriores a los videos, ya que ayuda a probarte que tan bien haz entendido todo el contenido. Muy recomendable para cualquier persona que quiere aprender a aprender. Muchas Felicidades y es un gran trabajo por parte de Dr. Barbara Okley y Dr. Terrence Senjnowski."

Awesome and creative approach on this difficult and puzzling topic of brain works by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, to which I'm eternally grateful. Also, the rest of the staff and wonderful people from additional video materials have a big shout out and were very helpful. They actually helped me greatly to see the bigger picture. A definitive recommendation to everyone. Best of luck to all who participated in creating this awesomeness. Thanks, Aron"
2020-05-31 00:00:00,Riyaz R A,5.0,0.0,"Awesome! I find it funny how neither school or college taught us any of this, which essentially ALL humans in this world must know. Learning is something we all do every day and every second and it is my absolute recommendation that every one of you take this course no matter how busy you are in your life. I know it's never too late but I only wish I had known all this during my college days. Dr. Barbara is an absolute beast of a teacher and knows what she's teaching. And it's hard to find teachers who actually KNOW what they are teaching. And so is Dr. Terry.
Leave what you are doing for just a week and complete this. It's worth it. 2 - 3 hours a day and you can complete it. Good luck."
2019-03-28 00:00:00,Mohammed O G,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed going through this well prepared course. I liked the idea of having short videos, instead of long lectures, where the danger is that you loose your concentration. I learned a lot to use for myself but also to teach younger staff. As a matter of fact I am thinking now in ways how to implement this knowledge in any new teaching activity. End of this year I am preparing for a scientific (medical) conference. The difficulty remains in switching from the usual (boring) frontal lectures to a combination of lecture, interrupted by questions and showing some interesting cases. All of this in less than 15 minutes. It is a challenge, which I have to discuss with friends and colleagues."
2021-12-30 00:00:00,Dawn A B,5.0,0.0,"Learning How to Learn was so helpful. I appreciated all the additional resources, such as the videos that highlighted a specific speaker.  Listening to the ways that those speakers overcame obstacles and found different methods that enhanced their learning process made it seem like you are not the only one struggling or feeling the way one may about learning and retention. I appreciate the videos were not long, as it helps to stay engaged more and remember more. I liked the quizzes at the end as well. I wish I started paying more attention to why my learning was not as effective but I will now. Great techniques provided and the course instructors were also great! Definitely recommend."
2021-05-24 00:00:00,Rachel K,5.0,0.0,I loved the course and was able to learn great techniques which I will share with other learners. All educators should take this course and it should be compulsory course for all learners as it makes learning that much more easier and actually fun. Regular testing should not create butterflies but should be a regular dose for every learner to be able to help with the retention. I loved the pamodoro - learning in short bursts and taking a walk as a way to help. starting with hard questions in a test was a new concept for me and also reviewing your work from bottom up. Great Course - I am glad I made the time to take it. it gives me more confidence to now register for my masters program
2021-04-19 00:00:00,Veronique M,5.0,0.0,"A tremendous course that I discovered by chance. As a teacher I feel both instructors and students can benefit of all the great insights provided throughout the course. Teachers can definitely learn how to adapt their course progression to leave time to the diffuse mode to do its job, and to give enough time to practice. Students can understand why they need to give their brains time to create strong connections, and why their teachers and instructors repeatedly advise them to practice regularly - and realize they may not be totally wrong. Thank you to Coursera for making this source of empowerment available to all and thank you Barbara and Terrence for sharing your knowledge with us. "

I have been struggling for long time of how to learn effectively and how to apply.  The focus and defuse mode works for me and Pamodora technique is like the medicine exactly fit my problem, I tried to use and focus on process not product which eliminated my fear of taking action, just do it for 25 minuetes.  I feel so happy and this enlighted my study life and career. I started fall in love of study, no matter how hard it is,  I have tools and I know how to use it, confidence within me , I have so much joy and content.

I had for a long time been interested in improving the way I learn new subjects, specifically abstract ones and was never really satisfied with my performance so I continuously try to find way to improve my process for learning.

This course although really light in terms of the complexity of the ideas captures most of the recurring ideas around how to learn better, diffused vs focused mode, spaced repetition, retrieval practice, active learning, how to deal with procrastination, etc. Although I'm a professional procrastinator, I'm also the proof that these techniques work ;) ... even I can finish this course."

This course teaches useful learning tips, practical examples, understanding about our brains and know how to make our learning more effectively!

I have practiced one learning by one to solve many problem that I faced and I am upset that I didn't learn this much earlier, I would have learnt differently in my past time.

And I will share this learning opportunity to everyone around me.

2021-01-10 00:00:00,Sergiy T,5.0,0.0,"I decided to take this course because I wanted to boost my learning skills and enhance my brain abilities. 



Now, after finishing it, I can say that I've fulfilled this purpose. This course has given me much information about efficient learning technique, so now I can see, that i've started to obtain new data faster and, what's most important, to embed this data into my long-term memory, so I can access it whenewer I need, even after a long time. Also it was useful to discover how can I can better focuse on my learning activity without interruptions and procrastination.



I definitely recommend this marvelous course to everyone, who wants to learn faster and more effectively."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,Margarita L,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed the course - it was helpful to review the basics of the best ways to learn. The most helpful was the the lecture about procrastination: tips on overcoming the negative feelings when starting learning activity (I realized in fact that it applies also for any other task that one is required to work on) and the expression 'eat your frogs first in the morning' motivates to concentrate on the most 'annoying' tasks first. 
I appreciate the course structure, length of the videos, and the friendly and casual attitude of the course instructors Barb Oakley and Terry Sejnowski. 
The complementary optional interviews are also a great source for motivation and inspiration."
2021-01-28 00:00:00,Jisoo L,5.0,0.0," This course is essential for all students and workers. It should be taught to all freshmen of all universities, or all high school and middle school students, If possible. It proposes the way of learning, and problem-solving, thus it covers businesses too. 

 The combination of the methodology and the neuroscientific grounds was persuasive. Additionally, interviews with the people who proved the theories by themselves were also impressive. Those various contents engraved the subjects in my brain. So I want to highly recommend this course to my friends and colleagues. 

  I'd like to express my gratitude to the instructors and the supporters. I really appreciate their efforts."

You'll hear from experts across all walks of life about how they deal with issues you thought only you dealt with. You'll leave the course with a new inner strength and all sorts of new ideas for your life. I encourage you to explore the optional material and read what interests you.

Because I've read a lot about the topic previously, most of the ideas were not new to me, but some definitely were, and the presentation just explained everything extremely concisely and linked everything together brilliantly. It had one great idea after another after another, with lots of information packed tightly in a small space (moreso since I watched it at 2x with closed captions). I got a lot out of this and took a bunch of notes, and am eager to try many ideas in practice, especially the ones having to do with procrastination, product/process, and the reward step for habits.

2017-10-28 00:00:00,christy.zhangy,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course which full of information and applicable techniques for daily life. I used to use pomodora for some time but couldn't stick to it as a usual technique helping me to focus. But after taking this course, I changed my mind and I think this is really want I need. I used it for a week and surprisingly, I was more efficient on my work. Also I realized there are so many areas I can improve in terms of time management. It's so hard for me to reach 10 pomodoras per day which is just 5 hours of working time. If I can truly focus for 4 hours/ 8 pomodoras, I think I can have plenty of my own time working on something that I have been trying to do in a long time.  "
2016-08-25 00:00:00,Jorge H,5.0,0.0,"At least on my country, formal training on learning how to learn is often omitted on basic education programs.  However, on higher education it is expected to have this skill already developed.  Learning techniques are then, self discovered or transmitted by word of mouth.  As a result, a mix of myths, fallacies, and actual useful and correct techniques are assimilated.  Habits and attitudes are developed based on those premises.  Some of this habits are positive others plainly negative.
Having this course for validating or correcting our own skills and attitudes to learning based on scientifically validated techniques is very valuable. Thanks to the authors for sharing it."

Many of the concepts discussed here may seem familiar, as many of us have figured (many of them) out through our own experience with learning. However, the great thing about this course is, it helps to put all those learning tricks together in a place of your brain (form a chunk !) and binds them together with logic and without a doubt makes you a better learner. I would recommend you to revisit the course materials from time to time even after you complete so that you don't forget them over time. Thanks to everyone who helped to put together this course.

As well, they explain the material in a way that is easy to understand. I believe that this course will be helpful to you if you are learning, but the most important thing to remember is that no matter how well you do in this course, you will not gain the benefits if you do not practice the important concepts like chunking, focus modes, diffused modes, and the mind palace that help improve and better your learning.

Engage with what you are being taught in this course and you will never look at learning the same way.
I found the module on habits and procrastination /particularly/ interesting.

Iv'e learn so many new things and methods I cant wait to my next course or tests to try this new skill.
the thing is that I very like to learn new things and to study but would prefer to do it by myself and not in a class but now I'm so happy because I feel like I have the tools to study better, more efficient and to understand why I have always been a mediocre student."

This is a great course for many people. It is easy, flexible and promises to either suggest great tools and methods for learning or at the very least inform you of why the methods you use work as well as they do. This is a great course for both learners and teachers as it can help in structuring learning and teaching sessions to maximise information retention and the likes. 
Further to that the tools for learning mentioned in this course are great and are backed by relevant research. This is a great course to do and if you're starting with MOOCs I would suggest this as one of the first courses to take. Thanks Barbara, Mr T and the crew. This was an enjoyable experience. "
2020-12-08 00:00:00,MARIA K,5.0,0.0,"This course taught me how to avoid the illusion of competence when I think I know or have learned something right and to learn something substantial rather than superficial using new techniques. Also through group interaction and practice I can discover a different perspective that I had not thought of. In this course I also learned to believe more in my abilities and not to be influenced so much by the comments of others which are sometimes not constructive. To have people by my side who support my decisions and do not hold me back for their own reasons.
I enjoyed this course because I learned many things that I can follow in my daily life in a fun and meaningful way."

Before this course i was stuck after the que, now I know how to apply my will power to shift my way of thinking. These new skills allows me to get more done by over coming procrastination. This course also gave me the insight that all things are possible to learn if you just compress them down in small chuncks over time.
I​ enjoyed every bit of it and i feel as is my memory of things will also increase.
I​ would like to have a refresher course just so the hardest concepts can be revisited.
s​o that i may master them.

2020-01-02 00:00:00,Colin R,5.0,0.0,"Very valuable, this course is a must.  I now realise as a programmer I was getting myself so stressed because I was using only the focused mode of thinking, I needed to always have one eye on the bigger picture and use the diffused mode of thinking a lot more to make sure my assumptions were correct and I was generally on the correct path. 
Another big take away for me was chunking and recalling what you've learned.   Also the pomodoro technique to overcome procrastination.  Process over product is one key takeaway, it's better to have a consistent approach rather than have the finished product in mind when you're working on something. 
Thank you for an amazing course!"

Maybe the best lesson of my life, the Mother of all lessons! The one lesson where theory and practice happen simultaneously, as the lesson is also easy to learn (if it was hard to learn it would be self-contradictory, but certainly not! A most user-friendly lesson, and two adorable and excellent professors :) )  Reminded me of: ""“Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.” ― Frank Herbert, Dune"""

I simply loved this course! It not only made me realize a lot of the 
things I was already incorporating in my studying, but helped me pick 
and sort the effective techniques whilst introducing others. The course 
also features optional interviews which can help get insight into 
learning certain subject areas from renowned experts. I also loved how 
interactive each video is, with a small quiz or short que at the end of 
many of them. Dr. Barbara really knows how to draw the audience’s 
attention and I found myself wanting to learn more at every point. 
Thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for this wonderful course

I really really enjoy the course material and the content. As a student, You should take this because it will answer your query with reasoning. How much it is important to exercise for learning? How to approach a test? How to handle pre-exam stress and a lot more? Some concept is fresh for me. I bet you you will not waste your time by completing this awesome course. It should be studied in an Indian school. Some point to our Instructors. The course material delivering can be more fun through animation and more example. Lastly, Thanks for learning how to learn"

I definitely would have benefited from all the tips and techniques given in this course.  For example how to get over the imposter syndrome and procrastination.  I have used the pomodoro method to get over my procrastination.  I also like the interviews with Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent.  They gave my great ideas on how to get over my test taking anxiety.  I have thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and would recommend it to anyone who is having trouble with learning new subjects especially later in life.
2020-06-06 00:00:00,Aryan R,5.0,0.0,"This course delivers on what it promises, a clear and concise instruction on how to get better at learning. A lot of these concepts seem like common sense but unfortunately they are not common in practice which should be the goal of all that have taken this course and what they should do in the future. Furthermore, some concepts like the Einstellung effect or the Memory Palace do not seem useful and seem contradictory BUT they are SOO NOT! I used the memory palace technique with my own room and I remembered a really long list of things, I  was amazed. What we need is humility and curiosity when viewing this course and apply these techniques without shame or doubt!"

It will change everything. Just make sure you write down everything you learn and study it. That's the most important tip. Every week is just as important as the first. You will regret not sticking through the entire course. It even gives you some important life advice. Anyone is capable of achieving what they want, and this course will show you why and how. This course is the type of stuff you learn and say ""Dang, I can't wait to pass this on to my kids."""
2020-02-04 00:00:00,Eugen G,5.0,0.0,"It is a good idea to go through this course before other topics
Coming back to the material and continuing can be tough sometimes but it's worth the effort because the concepts can help in other areas as well (such as handling complex tasks) 
The quizzes can cause some anxiety (it's a test...) but the questions selected and the way the answers are written will help fixing the most important ideas so they are very helpful in the end, also proving one of the concepts (that self tests are great for learning)
I felt the need to go over some parts of the material several times (using the notes) which means that times allocated for the course did not match the estimations."
2019-12-17 00:00:00,Dylan P,5.0,0.0,"I wish I have taken this course when 30 years ago when I have so much difficulties in learning. It provided valuable insights to how to learn anything, and even go as far as your daily habit, your mental health and physical health, all of those are linked! You can't study well without a good mental health and physical condition, and this course give advice on how to achieve all those requirements. As I have already read Mind for numbers, this course reinforced and retain my knowledge gain, and in addition, it provided extra reading material, exercise and most important of all, the forums and social page for interaction which you can't get just by reading the book.

2019-10-07 00:00:00,Mariló F,5.0,0.0,"  I finished university long time ago and although I am a curious person who is always reading, and informally learning about a wide variety of topics, I am considering going back to study more formally and that is why i took the course.I have found it very well structured, starting with the basics of how our brains work to slowly deepen into different aspects of learning, as well as practical tips and techniques that are applicable not only for academic studies but also for daily life. Even the way the course is constantly testing is a great way to practice the theory.The instructors are clearly very knowledgeable and Dr. Oakley makes the videos quite entertaining.  "
2019-06-12 00:00:00,Lilian M,5.0,0.0,"I joined Cousera a few months ago focused on improving my knowledge bank. I wanted to brush up on things I memorized in college before graduating in preparation for the corporate world. I feel so lucky that this was my first course. I now have a better reason to keep learning, in and out of cousera. 
LH2L is a revolutionary work of art that will change the life of anybody who remains disciplined enough to go through the whole course. It teaches techniques and practices that you wish you knew before attending any school. Especially higher learning. 
The methods, which I ended up using in the course itself are 100% effective, you just have to trust it. 
Happy learning."

This course should be taken by everyone; from high school students to anyone in their career wanting to sharpen their ability to learn in a rapidly changing environment.  It gives you good logic for how the brain learns, sound tools to use immediately and confidence that you can master new material or refresh old concepts. I also like how the instructors went back and forth between the practical application and delved into the scientific structure and inner workings of the brain so it reinforced why the learning concepts will actually work."

They really master their subject and make it very accessible to anyone to understand. Content is not complicated and extremely useful concept in every day life. Wish I had this class and understood best how the brain learn better and more effectively before spending so many years in the education system wasting precious hours with the wrong techniques! Human are gifted by having such a incredible ability to learn, it would be a waste to not learn who to use our cognitive and learning abilities to its greatest potential.
Thank you very much Barbara and Terrence,

2020-09-20 00:00:00,Madhav M,5.0,0.0,"  I have done 5 courses here and I consider this course the best of all. I loved the way they taught with funny examples that are easy to understand and help us to remember better what we learnt. This course doesn't puts any pressure on students of assignment and the tests are also designed in a way that helps the people go recall what was taught and by doing this we are able to retain what was taught to us. The words ,examples, stories, researches and  many more things made it even better to understand the terms . Even the optional videos were every informative and one should definitely see them.  I respect the teachers for their efforts for this valuable course.  "

I really enjoyed every session of the training. Its so well explained and easy to understand. The last 4 weeks have got me into starting new habits (like promodoro technique, doing the most difficult thing first, importance of taking breaks and rewarding oneself when something is done, maintaining a to do list and many more things) and working towards some of the things that i have been procrastinating for a long time! Highly recommend this course to anyone who would like to stay curious and keep learning! "
2020-06-13 00:00:00,Ruslan K,5.0,0.0,"The course tells about two different ""modes"" of mind work: focused and diffuse, 
and what each of them is for. It also gives practical advises about how 
to deal with procrastination, how to remember new material and how to 
prepare for tests.
The course is amazing. Information is divided into small 
well-formed chunks. Video lectures are not longer than 7 minutes, so you I was not get tired while watching them. Dr. Oakley's lectures are so 
clear and easy to understand even for non-English speakers, like me.

I would like to thank Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski for their efforts.Definitely recommend everyone to take this course regardless of the area of studying.

2020-04-18 00:00:00,Francesco B,5.0,0.0,"When I started this course I was very curious to know how, an On Line Course should have been of help for my learning projects.
Not only I found it really interesting, but after the very first videos I decided to stop any other learning activity, waiting to get to the end of the course in order to be more effective and not waste time with all other courses.
I so much appreciate the arguments, that I strongly recommend the course not only to students, but also to teachers (whatever their subject or level). Putting into practice all the information discussed within the course, should be useful to ""guide"" students and to help them to grow up avoiding false believes."
2019-06-26 00:00:00,Tatjana d,5.0,0.0,"this course is fantastic! while it all might sound familiar, it gave me fantastic tools how to retain what i learn instead of making a soup out of my brain by studying without results. I learned the importance of stopping and taking a break when a problem doesn't get resolved after 20+ minutes, the importance of exercise, sleep or simply a brake to unleash the more creative, diffuse working mind, to always start tackling bigger problems during tests first but let go and do smaller if after a certain time i didnt succeed. the importance of Recall and continuos Testing yourself and the importance of regular practice.

I spend 4 productive weeks studying the main rules and principles of learning during isolation. That knowledge and skills will definitely help me in my future life and career. Also I've been seriously thinking to become of a master of this course to adapt it for middle school students in Russia. I think these skills will be  truly supportive for those who has difficulties in learning, memorization, chunking, for those who being stressed during the exams and passing the tests, for those who doubts in their own abilities, potential and talents.

This course tell you how to learn effectively and efficiently,  with a relax way, easy to understand (even if your english is not good like me), and appliable in any fields . The coaches, Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence delivered their lectures as if they were talking to you directly and knew what are your problems during learning, why you have these and how to solve these problems. Each lesson will ask your feedback and I suggest you to fill it. I am really recommend this course to every one, no matter what or who you are, and how old you are! "

Mantenerme con una mente abierta, OCEAN   y toda la informacion recibida que he ido procesando ,entendiendo, practicando y repitiendo me ayudaran a los nuevos retos.

and remember techniques could have helped me in my studies. Long time ago, I
purchased audio tapes titled ""how to make A's in college"" and
listened to them and implemented the concepts. Those were very helpful. But
Learning How Learn is superior as it is based on biology and other scientific
foundations. I am not in school anymore but the concepts are applicable whether
I am learning a new skill like guitar or solving a problem on projects at work.
I have purchased the accompanying book and am half way through. I am begging my

The underlying concepts (e.g. focused vs diffused modes of thinking) and techniques (e.g. chunking and the Pomodoro) introduced in this course are particularly useful in boosting our productivity and ultimately show us a scientifically-proven and effective way of learning (and test-taking).

the course material, it also has bonus videos in which the best people share
their techniques and how they do it.

These include the concept of the two thinking modes (focused and diffused), our inner zombies (habits), willpower, procrastination, and some effective learning techniques. I just love how it gives a breath of fresh air among the ones I always see online. It was so technical yet highly creative.

I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get out of a rut, who feels anxious in subjects, who can't focus even in study environment, who finds it difficult to grasp certain subjects/ topics.

The information presented in Learning How to Learn was very engaging and presented in an accessible way.  Although I am an already-experienced learner, I gleaned many useful techniques, many of which I've already incorporated into daily life.  I took this course in conjunction with my home-schooled seventh grader and we both found ourselves sharing some of the most interesting bits of the course material with others.  The broad applicability of the course materials and the engaging style of the presenters make this class a must-take.  Mahalo nui, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!"

Also, it has given me new insights in how to become an even better learner and a better teacher. I now feel more qualified to share with my students the tips of learning how to learn.

Some will be familiar and some won't, but it's a nice refresher either way.  My complaints center around the brevity of each topic and also the amount of gimmies in each quiz/test.  While the prior is understandable (and remedied by a ton of supplemental reading suggestions), the soft toss quiz question get old.  Things like ""As stated in the video, performing the Macarena while stabbing yourself with a spork is a scientifically proven method to efficiently chunk data"" are humorous but kind of cheapen the quizzes and tests."

I am optimistic to work more to put a real value on this certification by sharing the real intent of the course to my realm.

I do recommend everyone to take this course, as I believe that regardless of your age, experiences in life, there is something that you would be able to take away from this course.

We weren't just given a bunch of learning tools, we delved into how our brains work around studying, chunking and memory. It was quite fascinating and the illustration bridged well with the tools provided.  The instructors were engaging and easy to follow. I thoroughly enjoyed this course. After many, many years, I signed up for a Masters in Divinity. I was really concerned about my performance. I didn't have a toolkit of how to study, read texts and take notes, never mind writing papers. I left my last course a little reluctant to take another course.

Something like this course - basically, psychology of learning with a focus towards useful applications - should be required of all incoming freshmen at ever college. I definitely wish I had taken something like it at the beginning of my college career. There is only one thing I'd suggest to improve the course further: The male professor is obviously very uncomfortable on camera, which made me feel uncomfortable also. I'd suggest considering re-filming some of his videos after a few more practice rounds so he comes off as more relaxed and comfortable. This is nit-picky, but it did make me want to skip some of his videos at times. "

You'll learn new way to study, use different thinking modes, and use sleep to solidify the material you're learning. The professor uses simple mnemonic's and a lot of visual aides which make it easy to understand and remember the concepts (which in and of itself is a lesson on how to absorb materiel).She's is very personable and cool, and for me personally, struggling to enter college at 26 for the first time, hearing her say she was my age when she started and is now an engineer was very inspiring!"

I regret that I have learned all of this only now, when I'm nearly 25, and not in school, where all this stuff should be taught. It could have prevented so much failure and suffering...
Then again, as the old saying goes, there's time for everything. I'll still make the most out of this new knowledge and whatever time I have left. Sincerest appreciations to those who created this course. It was an amazing job, really. Keep it up. The world needs it."

The information was really new to me (e.g. the greatest enemy to learning is procrastination - in German: ""Aufschieberitis"", or ""start hard jumpy easy""). it was presented in a funny and easy to grasp way (I loved the zombies and the little private photos and videos from Dr. Oakley). It was extremly helpful (e.g. Anki and the Pomodoro method).
As a mother of two teenage boys I am happy to pass on what I learned to my kids.
This is a valuable and fun course. And after the course they keep you informed with regular e-mails on the topic.

This course is suitable to be given in the first semester of every university education so students who have the intention to learn but have certain mind blocs or lack proper orientation on how to learn come out of that.Also the examples and interviews were very interesting and related to the subject matter. The usage of visuals and practice tests were intelligently placed which supported recall.I thank Professor Barbara Oakley and Professor Terrence Sejnowski for putting this together and help me make change in the way I can learn.  
2020-05-13 00:00:00,Jay D,5.0,0.0,"This course demonstrates some tips and techniques for learning, that you never knew. Implementing the ideas from this course will improve your learning at least 2x. One of the best things I learned from this course is that, REAL learning takes time. Don't expect from yourself to read something and remember it forever. To develop long term memory, we need spaced repetition, we need to keep our focus away from material so our mind can enter into diffused mode and do it's work in background. Metaphors are really helpful in memorising things. All these things are backed by neuroscience research. Give yourself a treat by opting in to this course."
2022-08-26 00:00:00,Юлия Ф Ч,5.0,0.0,"It's a wonderful course that has helped me review and improve my learning habits by applying some useful tips and practical techniques from the course. The course will help you deal with procrastination, illusions of competence, an Impostor syndrome, Einstellung and other pitfalls of studying you might have never thought of.  If you have no idea of a diffuse mode or chunking, or still believe that the number of neurons remains the same thoughout our lifetime, this course is a must. I am deeply grateful to the authors of the course - professors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowsky for their time, competence, experience and effort put in it. "
2021-01-23 00:00:00,Wylie L,5.0,0.0,"Hi there.
First of all, thanks to both Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski for developing this great course.  Not only does this course help me in learning effectively and efficiently, but also explains how our brains function during learning.  I learned many concepts, and here are some of them:- focused mode vs diffused mode,- short term memory vs long term memory,- fighting against procrastination,- learning techniques, such as chunking, spaced repetition, small tests, etc.I deeply encourage everyone to take this course, and you'll only regret not taking it earlier.  Enjoy!
P.S.  I'll be back for revision, and this is 100% for sure."
2020-07-08 00:00:00,Sapna C,5.0,0.0,"Wow !!  "" Learning How to Learn  "" was a wonderful journey for me ,taking myself into different concepts of learning methods .I sincerely thank the whole team for their effort to share and guide us in learning and memorizing the facts.We also  realized what are our procrastination's , weakness in our learning experience.
The videos  were mind blowing  and all the anatomical concepts were taught using metaphor and analogy,which will help us retain ideas in our mind . Thanks for providing interview sessions with some of the brilliant personality and sharing their experience.
I truly recommend others to choose this course and its worth learning.   "
2020-06-26 00:00:00,J,5.0,0.0,"Hello Instructors,
This course was wonderful. It has been a long time since I attended school or any kind of formal education. This course taught me things that I never learned in school but, wish I had. Important topics included how the brain functions when learning, why we procrastinate and how to prevent it, as well as the importance of recalling material through spaced repetition and deliberate practice. As someone who wants to continue learning and assist my family with learning this course introduced ideas that I will use daily and pass on to my children. Thank you so much for taking the time to produce this course. 
Best wishes, Joe P."
2020-04-12 00:00:00,Ramachandran C,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed taking this course. The course content was very engaging. Dr. Oakley's delivery was very lively and kept me thoroughly interested in the lectures. I also learned a lot from the optional interviews, particularly the ones related to language learning, memory, and the humanities. I am confident that I will be able to apply the lessons in this course not just for learning better but also for leading a more productive life in general. This course has taught me how I can adopt a learning attitude in anything I do and engage more fruitfully with whatever I do. I am sure I will keep revisiting portions of this course in the future."
2019-02-11 00:00:00,Luiz R T C,5.0,0.0,"The course allowed me a great reflection on how I have been learning what I want to learn. Such reflection, accompanied by new studies on the functioning of the brain, has made me change my study habits, for example, in language studies (English and French) and music, facilitating better memorization and understanding of languages. You, Dr Barbara and Dr Terence, are to be congratulated for the excellent didactics and simplicity in teaching a very complex subject, for the selected texts and the interviews that stimulated me a lot in the conduct of my daily life. Congratulations to the Coursera team for having provided this course. Thankful!"
2018-10-03 00:00:00,Elliott B,5.0,0.0,"My middle-aged eyes have been opened, thank you. I have often thought myself academically inadequate by having failed most of my school life, particularly panicking on tests, but this course has shown me, as well as the concept of Divergent Thinking, that I simply never had the tools to use my brain and body more effectively. These techniques and the knowledge should be taught to children and up, not later in life (I am aiming this at schools in general). At one point during this course I cried, because I was made to feel not a failure, but a person with the potential and ability to succeed if I simply change my attitude. Thank you so much."
2020-03-23 00:00:00,Sam M,5.0,0.0,"In my little experience of MOOCs, one of the best I've come across.
The great things about this course is that it unlocks 'keys' that will help you in learning any topics and in life in general. 
I think that's one more reason why it ranks among the best.
The use of videos, reading materials and other activities is well 'balanced'.
There is also a great use of metaphors and illustrations. Emphasis is on making things simple and accessible, without 'dumbing down'.
I'd recommend this course to anyone. 
I have actually recommended the Spanish and French version to 2 people close to me; as it will be accessible to them in a language they understand.

2015-08-17 00:00:00,Deleted A,5.0,0.0,"As someone who has only ever know subpar public schooling, poor parental involvement during formative years, and the old cram, regurgitate, repeat, study strategy, I cannot stress the amount of change in my educational paradigm that has blossomed forth because of this course. Learning everything I should have known all along including study habits, tips for procrastination, and learning how my own mind works are only a few of the tools that I will use for the rest of my life. I preach the Coursera word whenever I get the chance evangelizing anyone who will listen, and have nothing but appreciation for the entire Learning How to Learn team. "
2018-04-09 00:00:00,Mark A,5.0,0.0,"What a truly wonderful course about learning. Barbara and the rest of the presenters are fantastic. The course gathers together some of the most knowledgeable minds in the world to help explain how to improve the way you learn. The course is backed up by scientific studies and exudes quality in every way. I've learnt more about learning how to learn in this short course than i have in my entire life to date, if only this had been taught during my early education. I am already work out how I can teach the concepts and techniques to my young children so they will have  these amazing skills when they start their education. Thank you so much. "
2017-07-09 00:00:00,Kateryna D,5.0,0.0,"The best course ever! Really helpful and easy to understand. I highly recommend it for all people who want to understand how their brain works and how to make their study efforts more efficient. The course is also really useful not only for studying but in career - here is a lot of tips&tricks which help in everyday life and work. 
To my mind the best is not only to take this course but also read books by Barbara Oakley and watch the second course Mindshift on Coursera. Part of material would be the same but that is even for good - you constantly repeat the most important parts of knowledge and at the same time get a lot of extra material. "
2016-10-23 00:00:00,Javier C C,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course for everyone, I am a 28 year old Industrial and Systems Engineer about to start an MBA program in one of the most recognized Universities in Europe, and I am sure the tips and tricks taught in this course by Barbara and Terry will be of great help for this new endevour and the rest of my life without a doubt. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to keep learning anything the rest of their lives!  This should be the very first thing teachers teach in school! I´ve been learning wrong all of my life. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and keep up  the good work! Best Regards.                               JCC"
2021-12-29 00:00:00,Akshay J,5.0,0.0,"Everybody told me that study hard, always keep trying and always try to learn new things but no one told me that how I can learn effectively. This course helps me alot to understand that learning is not so much hard if you try some mental hacking tricks and some daily ethics which we should follow. If you want to be successful in your life then you need to have a genius and great mentor like this course mentors. Both are very intelligent and they they know our problems even if we are not interacting with them. So dont think so much, take this course because learning how to learn is the best lesson you will ever learn.
Happy Learning...."

2019-09-29 00:00:00,Mohd S A S S,5.0,0.0,"It is a good course. Highly recommended for High-school and college students for sure. However, you can take the course at any point in your life and benefit from the learning tips and insights. I had known some of the techniques before through other books and resources I had read in my school years, but it was nice to find all the information packaged so neatly and consume it in an organized fashion. It helps to remember the materials and apply it. And ofcourse there were many more new insights and sources of inspiration from the course. This is knowledge that you can then pass on to your family, friends and colleagues. Happy learning!"
2016-04-14 00:00:00,Nikolay K,5.0,0.0,"Thank you Terrence and Barbara! Your course was so enjoyable that I passed it in less than 3 days. That's how good it is.
As the English say: ""The more you study, the more you know. The more you know, the more you forget. The more you forget, the less you know. So why study?""
Your course helpes to overcome this vicious practice by using focused & diffused thinking, chunking, mnemonics, tests technique. I'll use them for passing Google AdWords exam.
I am convinced that real democracy starts when you start to learn and apply your knowledge into practice for the sake of future generations. Thanks for all!

I am very excited and grateful to be able to take this course because it can support my career and provide a lot of experience for me, especially regarding how to learn properly and correctly. I really appreciate the tutors who have provided their knowledge, this course is extraordinary for me because the material presented is very relevant and easy to understand, not only for students but non-students can learn this specialty because learning applies to everyone and everything can be found only study in this course thank you"
2020-11-03 00:00:00,Sharry L A,5.0,0.0,"  I recommend this course 100%! As learners, we think our personal learning ways are satisfactorily effective for us. But upon taking this course, it opened my mind to how our brain actually works and how we can actually override cues by being aware of what's happening back in our brains. It made me realize that yes I have lots of things to work on with the way I learn. Some of the topics that really made a mark on me are the methods to prevent procrastination, test-taking tips, modes of learning, and how these things can be applied in my day-to-day learning. :) I'm positively looking forward to be able to apply this in my everyday life.  "
2020-02-13 00:00:00,Laura C,5.0,0.0,"This course makes me opened my mind about how we really learn and make me realize how wrong I was about the techniques I was using to study, that only helped my at the moment for the exam but not to understand and remember in a long term way. I thank you because not only you helped us with teaching how we learn but also you taught us tips that will help us in daily life like how to manage stress, how to avoid procrastination (so difficult now a days) and how our thoughts can helps us in our learning.
Thanks to the teachers for teaching us your knowledge and also to make us believe in ourselves that we can achieve everything that we want"

I am so grateful for finding this course just in time. It has helped me learn so much about learning. I have never learned about so many learning tips in my life, and I am sure that these tips that the course offers will change my life forever, and will hopefully help me fulfill my dreams. To tell you the truth, I am already seeing a huge improvement in my understanding of the subjects I'm taking and I was able to do my tests well. With all honesty, I highly recommend this course. Thank you.  "
2020-06-07 00:00:00,Guillaume C,5.0,0.0,"  I have just finished the Massive Open Online Course entitled “Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects”. I think this course is the quintessence of a good course: it is interesting, well-illustrated, and transmits with passion by Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski.
 I truly recommend it to everyone as this subject concerns everybody. It really is an eye-opening course. I think I will go back to it in the future as some of the concepts I learned are really relevant for me (the Pomodoro, the Impostor Syndrome, the Hard start – Jump to easy technic, the concentration on process rather than product …).  "
2017-01-18 00:00:00,neha,5.0,0.0,"This is a fantastic course. It really helped my understand how we learn and how to become a better learner. It combines facts about the brain with our daily life which makes the information not only interesting but also highly relevant . Questions at the end of the videos are a great tool to make sure you were actually paying attention. during the video.
Barbara Oakley is a splendid coach and made  this course a memorable experience for me and Terry Sejnowski helped me understand science  simply without over simplifying it. :)
Kudos to the entire team of Learning How To Learn !
Cheers!
p.s. Thank you Coursera for offering such courses. :)"
2020-05-15 00:00:00,Barbara L,5.0,0.0,"Initially I started taking this course to keep my mind stimulated during the COVID-19 stay at home order.  Soon I realized how valuable it was for not only any future courses I take, but also for training and learning new things at home and in my job.  Or learning old things better!  This course is very relatable.  It was enlightening; it helped me discovery some of my own weaknesses and potential ways to correct and strengthen. I intend to recommend it to friends and family with school-age children.  I believe if a parent understood this information, they could better relate and assist their children.   Loved it!
Thank you very much!

2020-01-24 00:00:00,Valeria T,5.0,0.0,"This was my first Coursera course and it has been absolutely brilliant!  Thanks Dr Barbara Oakley for putting this together because you have outlined so many practical tips for optimizing learning.  On top of that, I really appreciated the interviews you did with different people on the subject - sharing their personal experiences in learning.  You even addressed many of the challenges people normally face and demystified it all - Einstellung and Imposter Syndrome for example.   You delved into a essential topic and made it so accessible - an indispensable start to learning anything else!  I wish I knew all this when I was at school!"
2016-01-28 00:00:00,Holly,5.0,0.0,"This course is the foundation to success in all you do! I can't praise these instructors enough for the time they spent in laying out the groundwork so clearly and efficiently. For those of us with ADHD, it's a life changing discovery of skills. Years of feeling like our brain is ""broken"" and doesn't function like others that are ""normal"" can be embarrassing and defeating to say the least. For those of you that want to simply improve your study habits and retain more, deeply... this is the course for you. Simple, effective and practical... This course was a delight! I highly recommend it, no matter your IQ, skill level or profession. "
2015-09-16 00:00:00,cjpembo,5.0,0.0,"I was a first-generation college student back in 1990.  I was intelligent, hard working, and had excellent grades in high school.  But I was totally lost in college.  I didn't know how to spend my time efficiently to maximize my learning potential.  My method was to just carve out a block of time at night to sit down and brute force my way through engineering homework.  That was the hard way to do it... this course will introduce the correct way to tackle tough courses.  
The subject material is not difficult at all; putting it all into practice may take some un-learning and effort, but you will certainly see benefits in the long run."

The information gained during this course has not only helped me in my academic life, it has made an enormous difference in how I approach my profession. I am sure that I will echo the comments of many who have completed this course by saying;  I wish I had known this information long, long ago! 
D​r. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski have provided me with new, very tangible tools which are already helping me in life and in learning. I am so very grateful to both of you!

I am grateful for the insightful technics and interviews with extraordinary people. Along with other resources that I was reading during completing the course it persuades me to change my daily routine, to plan the day work at night before, and make Pomodoro tracker my partner in completing all kinds of cognitive tasks. The way of organization of the course makes all underlined technics and concepts stick in your brain, so I do not have any fears to forget it. Thank you for the unforgettable experience and your contribution to my new lifestyle."
2021-04-04 00:00:00,Денис Е,5.0,0.0,"I liked the course. 
I want to emphasize the main points: 
1. Helped to understand that there are different ways of thinking. 
2. If you are unable to focus quickly and memorize a lot of information, then you belong to a creative group of people. 
3. That I can train my brain. 
4. Running helps to create new ideas and solve complex problems 
5. How to train memory 
6. In order not to procrastinate, you need to focus on the process, not the result 
7. It's important to practice 
8. The best memorization and assimilation of knowledge is a recollection in a new place of what you have learned, and also share this knowledge with others
Thank you!"

I was very pleased with the subject matter and it helped me really figure out how I could learn new and challenging concepts more effectively, as well as why I had trouble with certain subjects going through college. I really wish I had this knowledge when slogging through math and chem classes for my undergraduate studies! The instructors are very personable, professional, and knowledgeable. I think that anybody can benefit when learning how to learn, and I cannot wait to apply these techniques and new insights to my life."

Now I am implementing the methods I have learnt from this course, and improve my grades dramatically. Now I am recommending this course to my friends who are struggling with their studies, helping them with what I have learnt.and I believe this will help! After all, thank you so much!"

It breaks down ideas on how to study more efficiently, as well as focusing on retention. I especially enjoyed the week focusing on procrastination, as I have a hard time with that to point debilitation at times. This course has helped me to view things I would ordinarily avoid and I now try to make them a challenge or a goal to overcome. The course did not take so much time either, there is no reason you could not fit this into your schedule. I definitely recommend this course to strangers and I have already suggested it to my friends and family as well."

Dr.'s Oakley and Segnowski have given the world a great gift in this course.  The theory resonated with my personal experience over the years and really helped me connect the dots around how my mind works.  I was able to apply the practical suggestions immediately (and in fact while taking the course to the course itself!) 
This tools I've learned in this course have helped me become more productive in my work and home life and even beyond that I've been able to use what I've learned to help my kids with their schoolwork.  Wonderful stuff."

I wish I had been taught how to learn before starting school, instead of stumbling blindly through by using my own methods (though it turns out many of them correspond with the concepts of this course). 
Dr. Oakley - this course is now in my memory palace associated with an image of you holding the octopus of attention in one hand and a flying mule in the other, all three perched atop my window sill and no taller than 4 inches :)
I promise to teach as many of the concepts I've learned here to people around me who need to know them.

Nothing would be farther from true, I spent many years in the usual way of learning, which did not leave me with deep knowledge, it was just for the tests. This course have showed me the right tools for really learning, it has brought to my attention several key aspects I inadvertently dismissed when study previous degrees. More importantly it proved me that no matter how old you are, or how far you have advanced in higher education and academia you can still learn how to be better at learning! Fantastic course!!"
2015-11-08 00:00:00,Micheila,5.0,0.0,"Phenomenal course content delivered in fun, easily digestible chunks. I loved the references to the latest neuroscience and the stories of hard work and perseverance that led to success, like Santiago Ramon y Cajal. The bonus/extra reading was really helpful and entertaining as well (especially about writing and languages).
 It was a real pleasure to have taken this course, my first with Coursera. I wish I'd known this stuff 15 years ago when I was in university... I fell into the trap of re-reading as a learning technique. 
I'm telling everyone I know about Learning How to Learn, particularly those who are currently in university.

I used some of the new techniques that I learned in this course to master the course material itself and also had an easier time completing the final test.  I am very confident that the techniques that I've learned from Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski will help me become a better student and a software engineer.  I would love to be associated with this team and learn about newer research and developments that can help me get more out of life, perhaps a ""Learning How to learn - Part 2"" ?"

I have applied some of the techniques I have learned from the course, and they are useful and effective. It also debunks some myths regarding learing. But what I think is the most important is that it have changed my mindset. It alters my conception of learning, and even of other things in my life. I feel lucky having a chance to take this course. And Now I am taking another course of Barb andTerry (Yes, it's Mindshift! ). It's glad to see them again, and to learn something new that will also have a profound impact on my life. "

I was such a dumb that I didn't have these great techniques and I just wasted my 3 year college life. When I recall my college life, I just didn't learn much. I just went for the exams. It's pathetic honestly; however, now I have learned the GREAT tools from this class that I am going to teach all to my brother who is a sophomore in college now, and learning never ends that I can apply all the tools into my life long learning.  Thanks a lot for offering such an incredible class for free. 
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND  THIS CLASS. "

Understanding why it works, along with other concepts such as chunking, the zombie mode, procrastination, the focused and diffuse mode of learning/concentrating is so interesting and eye opening. What I learned through this 4 weeks I will take it with me forever and I'll share this knowledge with everyone I can, It's a must! I'm happy that I was part of this journey, thank you dr. Barbara and Terrence for this class and god bless you. Namaste everyone!  "

Like most of the people, I have read a lot about it, indeed. They all had little effect on me. It was all random.Trust me and take this course. It is an organized learning platform and will for sure help. I'm no extraordinary person but I already feel the better change in me. This course has given me a whole new perspective on learning. I got to know my past mistakes. I have changed my way of learning new things for good, to effective and efficient ways. Huge thanks to the whole team of this course!  "

When I ma learning something new on the internet i just want to go to the next step of the course or training to finish it fast and i never wanted to go back to the part that i already passed. It was like: "" yee i have done the assignments and passed the test, so i don t have to go back"".

I especially enjoyed learning about new ways to learn, how other people learn, the common struggles many of us experience, and the latest in research on learning. The tools, suggestions, and topics have already helped me expand my Chunked Mental Library. Useful resources were also provided; I purchased the book Fluent in 3 Months by Benny Lewis and signed up for the Publicationcoach.com.  I can't wait to dive into these resources. Thank you for a fantastic course.  Julia, Carlsbad, CA."

This neuroscientific based course enlightens me in scientific learning and makes me start to think seriously about how to learn more effectively. It's really a great honor to encountered this course, and I'm sure it would be one of the most powerful asset I ever had in my lifetime. My sincere gratitude to Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, How to Learn Team and all the interviewees invited. Thank you for all your great insights on me.  "

It is such a great course and the tests or assignment are very very useful and interective that I didn't even feel that this is a online course than It is far better from our offline courses. I highly recommend to anyone of you who are willing to go through this course. And lastly I will  thank Prof. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski to make this such a great course and all the great interviewers and also my peers who helped me complete this course. Very very thanks to all of you. 🙏❤"

But I lost track over a period of time. Things I need to learn accumulated over a period of time and when I looked at them it was overwhelming.  That's when I started taking this course. It has highlighted all the mistakes I have been doing learning and gave me tools address them .
Thank you so much Professors.  
For other learners like me, a piece of advice: Watch the optional interviews given in the course. They are real eye openers. You get to hear a lots of stuff from legends. "
2016-01-28 00:00:00,Ostap A,5.0,0.0,"This course is great. I'd say I became an evangelist of this course. I told about it to lots of my co-workers and I already feel I'm getting better at learning.

One of the main issues I always suffered with was ""cramming everything on 1 day"". I still believe I did the same during this course. But now, at least, I recalled the material from time to time in various places, explained it to my co-workers, listened to summary videos from time to time and testedmemorizing various stuff using memory palace technique.

This is a great course! Barbara & Terrence, thanks a lot!

Best wishes & thanks for learning how to learn!

I am 67 years young, and look forward to new challenges everyday!
My hobbies include Photography, tinkering with devices [fixing them] also gardening, if it does not grow this year try next year! I consider failures as successes as long as I learned from the experience.
My deep appreciation goes out to Barbara Oakley [I am also a veteran US Navy I crossed the Pacific and Indian oceans] so I also have a deep respect for all the people who have taken this course no mater where they live and reside!"

So I am really grateful to Coursera for giving us the opportunity to learn, and to our instructors, Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for dedicating their time and compiling such an amazing course."

Dr Barb Oakley conducted the course so smoothly with explaing each in such simple words and tone that I could finish  it earlier that the scheduled days of the course. I am also really thanful to Dr. terry Sejnowski and others who were interviewed and gave their inputs.

But the information presented (and presented well) was very informative and useful even for more mature lifelong learners. Both me and my amazing girlfriend took this course together and  will surely take the lessons with us and use them to learn more efficiently in our lives! Thank you very much to the professors. 
What I really appreciated were the sources at the end of every video. I'm the kind of person who actually goes through them and sees if there's anything that could pique my interest."
2022-08-15 00:00:00,Ruben N,5.0,0.0,"""Learning How to Learn"" is an excellent course that will provide you with new study techniques and change completely how you think about learning. Barbara Oakley will guide you throughout the complete course with her knowledge and experience, and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski will not only share his point of view about the topics but also give you scientific studies and conclusions that back up the things they share here. The time you invest here will be a reward for the rest of your life. Not only in terms of your studies, but also in terms of your personal and professional life.

Thank you for learning how to learn part! When she explains you feel that she applies all the knowledge on herself first and tries to teach us to do the same. Being a role model herself, she creates a feeling of trustworthiness with very insightful information to become successful in your learners! Thank you very much! "

There are so many useful hints and tricks that, even though very small and almost insignificant, have made a huge impact on my ability to learn new things, and how proficient I am at learning them. Understanding what's happing ""under the hood"" helped rid me of the guesswork that's associated with learning new things - that is, it gave me a tool that I'd been trying to find within myself for many years. The video-nature of this course, and the informative visuals helped to make the experience interesting, inviting, and stress-free. I plan on recommending it to all my friends.  "

Not only has it inspired and uplifted me, it has given me real and concrete methods and techniques for becoming a much better student (of life!). For all people of all ages, backgrounds and interests I tell you: take the opportunity to do this course and you will not look back.
I wish I had this course when I started university; it should be compulsory material for learners and students everywhere. In short, this course is OUTSTANDING.
I want to thank Barbara Oakley in particular for teaching me how to be a much more capable human being."
2017-01-21 00:00:00,Hong W L,5.0,0.0,This is a course that is truly about learning which applicable and practical knowledge and techniques are taught. Each video have visual aids and analogies with some comedy added in that helps to retain information. Questions at the end of the videos test your understanding on the lectures and a summary at the end of each week is useful in recalling and retaining information. I feel that most presentations and lessons taught in school can definitely learnt from this course in teaching more effectively. The tremendous efforts put into interviewing successful people in different careers and hearing tips are very enriching. 
2020-09-28 00:00:00,Russ P,5.0,0.0,"The course has been life changing for me. I'm familiar with the latest theories on learning/teaching, and was chose as a semifinalist for the Community College Teacher of the Year for North Carolina (not to brag, but I do have come credentials in teaching). 
 This course is by far the best way to learn how to learn. Both structure and content are so very well thought out that there's no room for improvement.
The sections on procrastination, Einstellung, and the Pomodoro technique have been life-changing for me. I am much more productive as a result. 
Kudos to the Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski, and many many thanks.

Although I completed my formal education long long ago ( I am a retired person), I decided to audit this course both out of curiosity and also to see if it can help me in my informal learning at this stage in my life. From my experience, I endorse much of what has been taught, and would highly commend this course for youngsters who frequently struggle to get their act together in academics or creative pursuits.The course has inspired me to learn what I have always wanted to do (like play music instruments), but for which I found little time earlier."
2017-12-04 00:00:00,Binsheng L,5.0,0.0,"I love methodology of doing things. This course teaches me the systematic methods of learning, some of which are what I have already known and applied successfully. It provides me a systematic perspective to review and reinforce the methods. Additionally, it not only provides insights on how to learn but also the scientific evidence that underlies the methods. Understanding the rationale helps me applies the techniques better and more flexibly. 
The course is not limited to any particular subject. It tells us how the brain works. It's helpful in learning anything. Anyone interested in learning should take this course."
2015-12-29 00:00:00,Anthony M,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course.  It provides tools for learning that actually work (if you practice!).  Not only does it describe the tools and how to use them, it provides the background, the accumulated understanding and proof of how and why the tools work (with creative illustrations and peer review docs).  Dr's Oakley and Sejnowski do a great job in the curation and presentation of this knowledge.  If they can keep my attention... they can keep anyone's attention.  I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in how we learn and also anyone struggling with learning any subject.  Thank you Dr's Oakley and Sejnowski!!"

I struggle more than most in learning new materials and subjects.  Fortunately, after this course, I have a real practical application, e.g., Pomodoro, Recall, Interleaving, Memory Palace, I can use to progress my life-long learning endeavors.

Not only does a learner gain incredibly useful life skills, as outlined in many of the other reviews, but also a community. The Facebook group and weekly e-mail from Barbara Oakley are great resources for a whole plethora of techniques and ideas about improving one's life. I would have been much better off had this course come into my life at a younger age, however, better late than never. I see it as a foundation upon which all of my future learning in life can occur. Please check it out and engage with the community. You will only benefit!"

Not only were the lectures insightful, but also the optional expert Interviews and Supplementary readings. This course will definitely transform you into a more conscientious learner.

Examination seasons are approaching in Jamaica, so I am motivated to write an article for the national newspaper to share effective learning strategies based on this course. Thank you again"
2022-04-07 00:00:00,Vera D,5.0,0.0,"Dr. Oakley is awesome. She teaches in such a way that learning is not a burden but an ongoing journey. And she doesn't teach as an authority but as a learner and fellow who has experienced the similar struggles or failures. She encourages the learners through the content and also through her expressions and body language. I like how the course is made up with short videos (some other courses have 20 minute long video for a single topic which is quite heavy for brain to digest) and frequently reviews what has been talked about before while teaching something new - just as it teaches, spaced repetition is effective.

Poromodo technique, I never heard it before but I got all information about poromodo technique in this course. So many things which gave me the technique to study well and improvement towards success & one think, our teacher gave this learning how to learn powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects course as our assignment but when I started to watch i feel happy.One best thing about coursera is they give us certificate after completing enrolled course "
2021-03-07 00:00:00,Bartholomeus A,5.0,0.0,"  I learned a lot about how our brain works in learning: what are the should n should not do, why some are should and some others are should not, more effective and less effective ways and the reasons, and also tips and tricks. And these all make sense and have given answer to my questions of whether I am learning correctly all these times.This course also explain everything in a simple, easy to understand and concise way, that I believe the material should be taught to students in elementary school (with some alterations to fit their age, off course), to form their habit of learning correctly as early as possible.

The course is structured in a way that will enhance your learning, and the classes with Barb are really funny and pleasant. This course is really valuable (much more than what I paid for it), and I encourage you to take it if you are a curious person who loves learning and would like to boost your ability to know about the entire world!

Indeed, I already knew about some of the concepts explained in this course but I never had the background information that really made me put them into practice on the long run. Other contents of the course were completely new to me and gave me a definite a-ha moment, where so much makes more sense to me now.
Lastly, the type of presentation of the knowledge and the videos were very well done. I truly enjoyed listening to them and would definitely recommend this course."

You're on coursera to learn right? This course teaches you how to learn effectively. So while learning to learn might seem like a strange concept (after all you've been doing it all your life) I would advise you to start with this course. That way, you can learn any later course better.
This course covers multiple learning techniques and, frankly, a load of techniques which are great to adopt for mental health reasons. This course shows you how to improve yourself more than any course I've come across. Everything is well explained, well sourced and effective. As a bonus, the additional interviews are fascinating. "
2021-02-23 00:00:00,Anna B,5.0,0.0,"I thought the course was presented in an organized and thoughtful manner with a little humor, too.
The segments were a nice size, not too full of information at any one time.  
Please tell the professor that I was particulary impressed with the idea that one can solve problems when one is asleep.  My mother was a dressmaker, and at times she would be stuck on how to place the pattern on the material in order to get the effect she wanted.    She would go to sleep, and in the morning she had the answer.  That was over 60 years ago.  Who knew that she had discovered what scientists would later verify.    
Thank you."

I think the test were sometimes to easy, and you just need to rembember the exact words from the videos, there was almost no need for self-thinking, but still I am extremely happy that my first completed MOOC is Learning How to Learn! It will help me with the new courses ;)"

Extremely helpful for people of all ages and from all walks of life. The only really bad thing about this course is that this was not available when I was in school or in my undergrad years. Though, currently I am doing PhD, I still feel its positive effects in my life. I didn't know that this course, which I started in my leisure time, will have long lasting effects on life and the way I think and solve personal and professional issues.

I accomplished these goals as well as learning a number of techniques that have helped me to overcome hurdles to my own learning such as procrastination.  I hope to share my learning with my children to support their education and help them to move them forward in their studies using a variety of the tools that I have learned.  I also plan to use this as a springboard to advance my career by completing more online courses which will allow me to branch out into new disciplnes and expan my marketability.  
2018-10-02 00:00:00,adrienne l,5.0,0.0,"The course was easy to do but I gained a lot of practical advice on studying/learning techniques that are immediately applicable. I also enjoyed the part where we learned the scientific reasons to some of the background processes that drives learning and the fallacies/common misconceptions related to learning. There were many concepts that I already know prior to the course but this course helped me consolidate my knowledge and also increased my enthusiasm in learning something new or challenging. The presenters, Dr Barbara Oakley & Dr Terrence Sejnowski are both very personable and delivered the course well."
2018-02-05 00:00:00,Михалева М С,5.0,0.0,"The course was created with interest and painstakingly, but half of it was obvious for me: the discussed techniques are possible to see at schools: for example, all the pupils know, that you need to practice and study information by chapters in a long period, not in the last night before exam.
But in the whole that was a cool expirience and I found some useful tips. Good analogies which were used in videos helped me to remember rules of effective study better. Furthermore it was a good practice for my English, I enjoyed while listening Barbara Oakley's narrative.
Thanks for creators of the course and good luck!  "

The use of visuals and videos made even the most complex and challenging topics easy to understand.  The sharing of specific techniques and varied styles of teaching were also helpful.  The team approach to teaching and sharing of knowledge was terrific.  The recommendations for additional reading/learning were/are much appreciated.  Read Dr. Oakley's book 'A Mind for Numbers - How to Excel at Math and Science (Even if you flunked Algebra), as I was taking the course and am now reading Moonwalk with Einstein by Joshua Foer."

Every new technique to learn better is backed up by research, and all the material used to make this lectures is also on the references for people to go deeper into it.
I was a little bit sceptic at the beginning of the course, but this is not one of Coursera's number one classes just because: this is a fundamental class that, if taken seriously, will work as a base to keep building knowledge in other courses."

consider myself as someone who works well once I’ve discovered how certain
systems work, which is why I find it incredibly important that this course
taught me how mind works. Being able to understand the different modes of
thinking has also allowed me to embrace my humanity and actually be okay with
it – that is, because I used to think that resting and sleeping are usually counterproductive
for when I’m trying to learn. I find this course essential to people of all age

it."

It was still really fun though, and very useful as well. To be honest, many of the topics that were touched upon were things I had vaguely figured out through my own experiences. However, this course has crystallised and validated those ideas to the point where I feel confident in applying them in real life. I'm absolutely certain that some of my past frustrations with learning were from NOT following the advice here. Thank you for this course! It will help me a lot for my current career-change!"

The material is presented in such a nice way that makes someone readily identify with what one needs to do in order to become a better learner. 

I recommend this course to everyone regardless of how skillful at learning they are. Understanding your brain and memories is a nice exercise on your road to mastering tough subjects. Kudos Barbara   "

registered the course in order to help me understand more about my brain and improve

The
first week, I feel like both of professors are so weird and the video lectures
like the 1960s movie. Surprisingly, after the first week I was looking forward
to see them and the next session. I very much enjoy it. I like the course content- understanding how the brain work and how to get
better brain.

Both the teachers taught in a very interactive way and I very much liked their teaching style. The bite-sized tests at the end of each video were very helpful in retaining the key parts of the material. I am very sure that this course that I just finished will help me in all areas of my life and definitely will help me learn faster and more effectively, now that I have a brief knowledge of how our brain works. I will recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn, ""How to learn effectively"".  "

I remember i used to write every illustration to feed it in my permanent memory. Also i used to thoroughly read the entire theory part before starting the mathematics illustrations. So i understand and can relate to this course very practically but yes there are enumerous value additions that this course has made in my learning way. Thank you Barbara and Terren."

I am hoping to study a Masters of Research next year, however, it's been a long time since I've done any formal study. This course has given me the confidence to believe I can be successful in my studies, as well as the techniques to make sure that is true.

So I would recommend this course to all students out there. Also recommend it to those who like to learn new things or trying to switch career by learning.
This course gives insight how can you do better in your academic/professional life."
2017-07-10 00:00:00,Matthew S,5.0,0.0,"All the content in this course is really interesting and useful. I watch it at 1.5x speed most of the time. 
This class should be required education before attempting to learn anything else. The idea that nearly all students are expected to learn subjects without having first being taught how to learn is ridiculous.Note to Barbara Oakley for whoever is managing this MOOC: Please remove the repetitive superfluous phrases from quizzes, ""as several of the videos mentioned,"" ""as one video emphasized,"" etc. Just remove all references to the videos. They are unnecessary, and only make the quizzes take longer."
2020-05-06 00:00:00,manjit s,5.0,0.0,THIS Course is extremely useful for every one.The way Barbara Oakley explains is fab .I would recommend any one who is sitting free  to utilize their time by doing this course u will love it professor  Terrence Sejnowski teaches the working of our mind that will be great help for people not only for particular subjects like maths and science but  in each part of life. One  could apply THESE principles can take a full control over the procrastination. The course teach exactly what we need to overcome procrastination and will be enjoying various process in their life.Why r u waiting for enroll it now.
2016-02-13 00:00:00,Armando F,5.0,0.0,"Muy buen curso, creo que todos los estudiantes desde la educación primaria, deberían tener una capacitación previa en el sentido del aprendizaje, y en las herramientas que permiten una mayor retención de lo aprendido. Cuantas veces hemos estudiado alguna materia solo para poder rendir un examen y luego en el tiempo nos damos cuenta que no podemos recordar absolutamente nada de lo que habíamos leído. La base fundamental no solo es adquirir nuevos conocimientos sino que ademas puedan permanecer en nuestra memoria de manera permanente, y este curso proporciona herramientas muy importantes para ese fin."
2016-10-15 00:00:00,Renato G d S,5.0,0.0,"Very good insights. It is nice to understand how your brains works when it is involved on a leaning process. And even though, it uses some concepts and tips we already  know, it is also important to rethink about then, for knowing something exists does't mean you use it properly.
The teacher are just spectacular. The lessons are really enjoyable. And i found it quite useful to learning and practice English.
The questions on the and of each video are very good. They are obvious most of the time but, by reading then, we use the recalling process taught on the second week, and it helps us to chunk then.

2020-04-23 00:00:00,Bohdan P,5.0,0.0,"ENG|UA This course is very powerful.
There are a lot of interesting and, what is important, helpful information and practice
advices how to use your brain more effectively. And the main teller – dr.
Barbara – has a very nice voice, so listening to her is not only interesting,
but also enjoyable. Don`t think – JUST JOIN and ENJOY IT!
Надзвичайно корисний та захоплюючий курс. Багато практичних порад, підкріплених багатьма дослідженнями, та інтерв'ю з фахівцями у своїй сфері, які діляться своїм досвідом з навчання. Тому не тягніть кота за хвіст, а реєструйтеся на курс) Приємного навчання про навчання!"
2017-02-28 00:00:00,Shuchao,5.0,0.0,"This course is awesome. Dr. Oakley has taught many helpful skills on how to learn. But for me, the most important and most helpful thing, is that you are not born to become who or born to be specifically proficient in some subjects. As long as you learn with right methods, you can learn anything. For long I've been trapped and handicapped by the ""einstellung"" that I'm not a math or physics learner. Now I'm completely confident that all I need is to walk away from the comfort zone and learn efficiently with those useful and scientific methods. Many thanks to Coursera and the course team. Thank you!"
2022-01-17 00:00:00,Timothy J M,5.0,0.0,"One of my college professors recommends this course to all of his students. Compared to my normal courses, this class was a breeze. The focus of this course isn't to be difficult though, it's for people of all ages and professions to understand what techniques to employ or avoid in order for them to better acquire and retain knowledge.

If you have a free week, and spend a round an hour a day listening/watching this rather then that next TV drama series you plan to binge you can easily breeze through this course while learning some information that could help you learn some valuable life skills."
2017-09-03 00:00:00,Diego C,5.0,0.0,"Great course. Very useful techniques, easy to understand concepts and helpful to make you more productive. I learned how to stay focused in my studies, keep the information in my memory for more time, how to avoid procrastination, how to prepare for a test and the importance of stress management before test. Also, which part of the material I should focus on when I'm learning new topics. I recommend this course for everyone who's focused in develop yourself and learn techniques that help to learn fast and more easily. The last month was great. Thanks for all. I'm a new student after this course. "
2015-09-14 00:00:00,Kelly J K,5.0,0.0,"This course was invaluable to me in teaching best practices for learning. I consider myself a lifelong learner and have been seeking useful techniques for learning difficult material and retaining new material. I didn't take to any suggestions from a previous informal ""study habits"" mini-course, and for over a decade, I just resigned myself to not being intellectually able or disciplined enough to tackle certain subjects, but Professor Oakley's teachings encourage me to mount and master learning mountains. This was a fantastic course, and I have already recommended Prof. Oakley's work to others.  "
2020-07-22 00:00:00,Maria-Elisa D,5.0,0.0,"I am 50 years old, I love learning, and I keep on learning! I took this course to get ""how to"" learning tips to share with my elementary students and my 11 year-old son in their studies; however, even though I have a bachelor's degree and I thought I knew enough techniques on how to learn, I found myself learning interesting and very efficient techniques that I had never heard of before.
I recommend this course to any student, no matter their age, to learn how to efficiently increase their retention capabilities and even how to relieve stress prior to testing.
Thanks Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski!"
2018-02-24 00:00:00,CHRISTOPHER B,5.0,0.0,"This Course was hands down phenomenal and so fundamental for anyone wanted to facilitate a better understanding in how are brains work and process information. If you ever once wonder why sometimes you beat information into your cranium and come to find out a few days later you forgot everything, well this course will explain and talk about focused mode and diffused mode of learning. I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to be a well rounded and efficient learner.  I would like to thank the amazing instructors for this course and this opportunity to grow and enhance our brains. "
2021-01-28 00:00:00,Bob Q,5.0,0.0,"Wonderful course: lots of useful and relevant information along with a ton of techniques to learn and use to improve your learning curve. I recommend it.

But, I found the online presentation a bit difficult and confusing to use. When I would sign in for study time, I expected the program to take me back to where I stopped yesterday and firmly guide me to my next step/lesson. Or if I wanted to find a video to see again or an article to read again, it took me a fair amount of searching to locate it.  So, I give the course content five stars but the organization and presentation of it three stars. "
2021-05-09 00:00:00,Julia S,5.0,0.0,"Thank you for this course! The form reflected the content, i.e. you used the methods you taught us to help us learn, which is the most convincing thing you could have done! I knew some of the things you shared but learned many more, and as an English teacher I was really looking for a way to help my students learn by explaining to them how learning works, and that course is a great inspiration for that - actually, I'll probably be using some of your videos in class! I've recommended this course to my university classmates as well, but actually... I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE! Thank you so much!"
2020-04-22 00:00:00,Mukul S,5.0,0.0,"well at the starting of this course I think that the topics that are in this course are already known by me. But when I go through this course I found that the small things that we don't consider during our learning phase will make us suffer in the particular subject. So here I have got those small and necessary things that are required to learn new things or subjects very effectively, not only for temporary time period but also for life time.
If someone is thinking about doing this course then my opinion is you should definitely go for this, before starting learning new subjects in your life.  "
2020-04-08 00:00:00,Pavan C,5.0,0.0,"This is an amazing course. First of all, it was well made. Every video is entertaining and informative. They include sources for each point they make. The quizzes are also very useful to help you understand the info. In addition, the instructors speak clearly and passionately in the course. It's rewarding to not only learn how to learn, but also see the neuroscience behind the process. The syllabus is clear and helpful for anyone. It covers everything needed for one to be a successful learner. From chunking to memory tactics to how to tackle procrastination and tests. Overall, a great course.
"
2019-01-12 00:00:00,Matt N,5.0,0.0,"This was an excellent primer on the subject of learning. As someone who's passionate about learning, this course was basically like healthy crack-cocaine - I think I finished it in 4 or 5 days because I enjoyed it so much. I particularly enjoyed the section on procrastination. There is a lot of actionable advice throughout the course that is complemented with solid neuroscience. Learning is basically a superpower that impacts every other area of your life, so a course like this has massive carryover to everything you do. Overall, I highly recommend LHtL and will be pointing friends toward it."
2017-05-01 00:00:00,Ahmad H,5.0,0.0,life changing course for me. i think everybody should take this course and that it should be included in the curiculum of all schools. this course helps you maximise what you learn from every course. to maximise what you learn from this course you need to have taken this course (do you see our dilemma here !). here is a tip from someone who has completed this course using the material he learned from this course. try recalling what you learned after each video. and try to make a list of practical applications that this course has inspired you to do and write them down and start applying them.
2020-05-24 00:00:00,Akvilė Č,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed this course. Just a few days before I've joined the course me and my colleagues have submitted the draft of the course for teachers ""How to apply metocagnition in order to help students to learn"". Improving that course I will be able to use some ideas from this course. It's a pitty that I had not enough time to work on this course because of the very busy time for teachers at the university. But I was also able to see how the distance course ir organized and will be able to apply some ideas working on my distance courses (if it will be needed because of the pandemic). Thanks"
2018-11-15 00:00:00,Kingsley D G A,5.0,0.0,"After completing this course, the enlightenment has not only enhanced my learning of courses, concepts and ideas but also given me valuable tools to be more productive in my personal life: Tackling other topics like procrastination, handling fear, being confident, looking to broaden your passions rather than limiting yourself to things that you are ""naturally good at"", and more has greatly improved my life!



There should be no hesitation towards taking this course, even if you have a way of going about your learning, there's always a perspective you are missing out on (Einstellung) !

I find this course coincidental on Coursera. I am still a student and recently day I lost motivation to learn more and sometimes I feel very frustrated. This course will help me a lot. This is a great fundamental for me to start a lot of other courses. I really happy and enjoy this course. Thank you for this course will help me find my self-motivated for lifelong learning and overcome impostor syndrome. Thank you instructors very much."

I learnt here how to train my mind to learn things effectively and keep them in my memory for longer time. The course explains how to use focused and diffused mode to solve new problems. The course very well explains how to deal with a habit of procrastination and also how Einstellung prevents us from learning new things. Actually every video teaches us so many things. Barb and Terry are awesome in teaching. I recommend this course to the people of all age groups who are willing to learn something."

It helped me to look on learning process with new and fresh perspective.
Some ideas i did't know, I find usefull for me even in daily small tasks as well as during my learning and training process. 
But not only small techniques, the whole cource like big and strong concept how you can understand, organize build you learning process and get you learning goals done more effective

As a project manager, a team leader, a teacher, and just as a person who is always looking to learn new things, I left this course very satisfied and fulfilled. I've already recommended this course to several of my friends and have already applied techniques, such as the pomodoro technique and recall in my daily life, while also examining how einstellung transpires in my day to day decision-making. 

Thank you for the wonderful lessons the past few weeks!!!!"
2015-10-26 00:00:00,Archisman D,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent and valuable course. It is useful for all people, whether young or old. It has the ability to change, not only the way people learn, but also the entire life of an individual. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable, as it is seen from the videos itself, and fascinating too. During the course, I was continuously gaping and marveling at the videos and the wonderful facts that were completely unknown to me. Never before, had I even ventured to know about the brain and the things that affect it. I hope each and every individual has the opportunity to view this course.

2020-05-24 00:00:00,Shir W,5.0,0.0,"The course was fun and motivating. The learned material helped me better learn the course itself. I am now able to accomplish twice the tasks I used too before, which is important to me as a fool time autodidact learner. The whole experience was also encouraging for me to keep pursuing my goals and studies, feeling competent,  as well as enjoying preparing and reviewing the daily and weekly tasks and ways of studies.
Thanks to the tools I have acquired in this course, in just one month, I've been able to improve my third language to the best state it took for the past four years. 
Thank you"

Then I drop the classes and repeat... This course taught me so much that I have already applied to my life, job, and education. I recommend this to everyone no matter there education level, age, career path, etc. Learning How to Learn has taught me how to study, focus, retain, and change the way I view a tough task whether it be a ten page essay, big project for work, or an errand I've dreaded for far too long. Thank you, Professors!"
2021-07-27 00:00:00,Muhammad U A,5.0,0.0,"One memory that keep coming to me about the diffused mode is from the start of my accounting career.  In good old days when ledgers were written manually, tallying  the trail balance was the most daunting task.  Many a times we will work several hours, using each and every technique in the accounting books to find that 25 cents to tally our trial balance - only to leave late from the office in sheer frustration.  And the next morning, within first half an hour, we will find it.  Now I know why - and so many other things that I have been fighting off.  Wish knew these techniques long ago! "

This course gave me some very useful information and techniques that I've already started to apply (Pomodoro technique, chunking, memory palace - all of this takes practice!). I recommend this course to anyone - students, employees who are learning something new on the job, or just anyone who has the desire to gain new skills. Many thanks to the instructors and UC San Diego for providing this course. I was engaged and excited to start each lesson. "

  Indeed, it's a very useful course covering concepts behind how to learn effectively and efficiently.This course is applicable in all aspects of life. Because of this course, now I understand the process of learning better, and because I understand a little better, I've become more motivated in trying new things out.I want to thank the tutors for this wonderful useful course and their videos, and I look forward to seeing more of their work.

2019-10-17 00:00:00,luciano c,5.0,0.0,"In italiano: si tratta di un corso utile perchè si focalizza su qualcosa che raramente viene insegnato (almeno nelle scuole italiane) ovvero a COME studiare piuttosto che a cosa studiare. E' valsa la pena seguirlo. Grazie a tutte le persone coinvolte in questo progetto.
English: it's a MOOC worth his while because it focus on something seldom teached in school that is HOW study and not on what to study. Follow the course is, in my opinion a good way to spend a little of your time to get many cue on how improve yourself. Thank you to all the people involved in this project.

I am being totally inspired by the facilitator Barbara Oklay's syle of the transaction, it has such a social presence and an appeal to the learner. The videos , learning material, essential and optional resources are organised so well, that whatever is taught is applied like chunking, short videos, testing, etc. My own doctoral research is on self-directed learning and the interview with Dr Richard in week 4 was so relatable.
Thank you for such a wonderful, stimulating learning experience!!"
2020-05-21 00:00:00,Sathishkumar K,5.0,0.0,"This is an amazing course. The design, flow and videos help gain understanding of the content in a seamless manner. The learning is highly engaging because of the simplicity of concept and the clarity of ideas provided right from the beginning of the course. Regular assessments and options to study additional content makes the learning more fun and exciting. The best part of this course is that one can apply the learnings of this course to anything and everything that you are learning or wish to learn. This is must do course for anyone who wants to keep learning in this journey of life"
2018-01-29 00:00:00,Maher H,5.0,0.0,"Amazing course given by amazing people! the course chunks the idea of learning and explains it very well. The course provides techniques to learn and to combat procrastination. I have discovered that I didn't know how to learn and all my previous study sessions were totally ineffective! This course doesn't just apply if you are learning in school or college but also it applies in the work place! More and more we as individuals are committed to a life long learning, and this course is the perfect companion to hone in the right skills needed to learn! Thank you for such a brilliant work! "
2021-11-14 00:00:00,Sameer D,5.0,0.0,"T​his is a wonderful course! 
I thank Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski and all the team members who put the MOOC together. 
The videos are wonderfully edited with change in image sizes, animation and supers providing a pause which helps in the learning process.
 The content is superlative and extremely helpful. Of course, it will require spaced repetition for the knowledge to become part of my long term memory : )
T​hough I am not a student in the academic context, I found the material very beneficial. The optional readings and videos had surprising bonuses.
I​ recommend it highly to everyone.

2020-11-17 00:00:00,Iulia F,5.0,0.0,"This is the first Coursera course that I finish. Large part of this is due to the instructors. Their candour and dedication to the job took me back to my 7-yeard old self, eager for and excited about school and learning.  The work and passion put into every detail in this course - references to personal situations, funny quizz questions - are off the charts and contagious. Dr. Oakley and dr. Sejnowski (and the whole team), I hope you are reading this. Big, big thank you for this course and for all the efforts to connect with your students. Everyone deserves professors like yourselves!"
2020-04-18 00:00:00,Nicolette v Z,5.0,0.0,"I loved doing this course. It gave a lot of insight in learning, always in short clear video's. I especially enjoyed it, because you didn't have to view all videos at once to understand the information. You could easily stop somewhere and pick it up two days later. The test at the end of a ""chunk"" of information was nice to really check if you understood everything. And after this course I not only have some new tools which I'm using when learning, I was also able to find out where in my learning I could improve. Thank you for making this course available for Free. Much appreciated!!! "
2020-07-10 00:00:00,Swarnim N,5.0,0.0,"Amazing course! I took this course out of curiosity, but it turned out to be a prespective-changing course. I am really inspired by the contents of this course and the efforts they have put into making the complicated contents easily understandable. The Instructors have addressed many problematic issues for students such as imposter syndrome, procrastination, and also preparing for the test. I am really grateful to the instructors for making this course. I recommend this course to all the students and lifelong learners. I hope you find this course as helping and interesting as I did.  "

2017-09-22 00:00:00,Carol E,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed this class. It gave practical and immediately useful ways of learning just about any material, and was a great motivator for trying to learn not just about learning, but several other subjects that I've been putting off. Dr. Oakley's clear, and fun examples not only helped me remember the concepts, but also modeled what methods I could be employing as I learn on my own. Highly recommended (and sent to a couple of college-freshmen-to be!). Wish I'd had it back in my college/post university studies; it would have made life and learning both more effective and more fun."
2020-06-15 00:00:00,Vibhor V,5.0,0.0,"Although I started off the course with not a lot of dedication and concentration (one of the reasons why I decided to take it up - my lack of commitment), the course definitely got me hooked even though it sometimes used terms I have been unaware of. Barbara really made it an easy to understand and take control of two of my age old enemies - lack of willpower and excess of procrastination. Now that I understand the science behind why we do what we do, why we think why we think, I believe it will definitely be much easier for me to tackle this in the future. Do give this course a go!"
2020-01-18 00:00:00,Sonya N,5.0,0.0,"As opposed to having one long video or lecture per week, the short video clips made it easier to complete the weekly assignments thereby completing the entire course.  The course has increased my self-confidence in my learning abilities by realizing that my way of learning throughout the years, by writing the material and testing myself, has not been effective because of a self-perceived learning disability, but these methods are truly effective for all learners.  As for my school-aged children, it further validates their Grandmother's advice about learning and test performance. :) "
2020-05-02 00:00:00,Chezarina M,5.0,0.0,"This course was amazingly eye-opening and encouraging! I've struggled my entire life with the limiting belief that there is something wrong with my brain because I don't seem to retain information as easily as my fellow peers. Thanks to the information in this course I've realized that this belief, coupled with the ineffective techniques I've been using are the real reason I've been struggling. My brain is in fact completely capable! This course is a healthy dose of vitamins for the mind. I'm so excited to apply what I've learned to all the subjects I've avoided learning thus far!"
2020-07-12 00:00:00,Namita S,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course that brings scientific knowledge about the workings of human brain and teaches the ways to maximize results when studying for a test/examination or competition. The course is full of research backed data and interviews from academicians who shed light on their own ways of learning and success.
I was glued to this course from start to end as if it was a Netflix TV series. It is that gripping and delivers great information in lucid and easy to digest format. Highly recommended for anyone preparing for any big test in need of an extra edge in their performance!
"
2022-01-08 00:00:00,Pankaj D,5.0,0.0,"Everyone should read this book right at their teenage or before and follow up the concepts throughout their lifetime. Even if you missed it don't panic!  it is still equally worthy if you consider yourself reading anything generally for academic purpose; just give a few hours a week to this course and you will feel its merit...throughout your life. Thanks for the instructors and COURSERA for scholarship to University-attached email due to which I got to study one course for free per year. Even if you cannot pay, don't panic, still you can consider filling the financial aid form.

2019-04-30 00:00:00,Jay S,5.0,0.0,"Thank you for providing insight into the indoctrination process that began in early childhood. Antithesis modeling of globular science, Darwinian evolution and the total elimination of the Creationist model of belief. This course further reinforced my belief that men and women in power have abandoned critical thinking but will blindly follow the beliefs of previous generations without having the ability to go against the schooling from liberal institutions with only creating sheep. Thank you again for reminding me of the power of illusion that is witchcraft of the highest order."
2017-09-18 00:00:00,Felecia W,5.0,0.0,"I love this course! It is endlessly fascinating to me, and actually one of my ""problems"" is I NEVER want to just do the coursework. I want to read EVERY optional reading, and view EVERY optional video, and so on! The ability to switch sessions has been lifesaving for me! Although I'm not getting the certification, so I do have that flexibility, thanks to Coursera and the instructors! I am very encouraged by Dr, Oakley's personal turnaround in her areas of expertise AND career-satisfaction! I highly recommend this course to ANYONE who is trying to learn, and who enjoys learning!"
2016-07-20 00:00:00,Goldie J,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course! I thought it would be just another bit of practical advice to scroll through and pick up a couple of gems of insight from the rubble. But the whole course was amazing! It provided so MUCH insight into the neuroscience and brain processes involved in learning and paired it with techniques to hone skills. I came away recommending it to all of my friends, and with a better grasp on the second language (espanol) I've been working on for forever. I never thought I would get such immediate real world application from what I had considered an 'extra' type of course. "
2015-09-22 00:00:00,Peter J P,5.0,0.0,"This is a fantastic course and should be either a prerequisite or recommendation for anyone taking any Coursera course. It's simple, easy, insightful, and yet very powerful. Most of the the observations on how to learn may already be familiar, but the explanations put things into a coherent framework. A great review of some useful techniques to help save time by learning more efficiently and productively.
Kudos to the presenters and UCSD for keeping it light hearted, interesting, and engaging!
I can not recommend this essential course highly enough: Does what it says on the tin!"
2020-05-26 00:00:00,Kavin P,5.0,0.0,"Today, when social media and many other platforms are affecting career choices of many people- just due to the fact, that technical stream needs more efforts to be put in. Young people take it as their own inability or that the subjects to be very tough... This course fills our minds with motivation, energy and equips us with the necessary skills to study in the best way.
With psychological and biological reasoning, it brings us the best effective way to - how to learn anything in the best way.
Thank you so much to both the instructors - it has entirely changed the way I learn."
2020-04-30 00:00:00,Pallavi M,5.0,0.0,"  I had seen many video's before and thought this course would be the same, but I was wrong, Beautifully organised lecture sessions, simple visuals to understand the concepts made my learning experience very productive. I am an Instructor and will be using these techniques not only for myself but also for designing exercises and problems for my students. You guys have nailed the actual understanding of how to learn. the Interviews and reading material were very useful and motivating. Kudos to the team for such in depth work and your passion for this subject is just contagious!!  "
2020-04-22 00:00:00,SaharM,5.0,0.0,"I absolutely loved the course. I genuinely think it helped me learn and improve on things I've been wanting to learn for ages, and I'm so much for enthusiastic to learn now. I appreciate that you took the time to explain everything, even on the neurological level, and so empathetically, that I wanted to come back to the course and learn more, and also for patiently repeating material over the videos so it stayed rooted in my mind. I do think I respond well to kinder teachers so thank you do much for being so patient and hopeful and encouraging. Can't wait for the next course. "
2015-11-15 00:00:00,OumaimaRharib,5.0,0.0,"This online course absoloutely deserves to earn these 5 stars , I can't seriously believe how much I've been taught and how much I've learnt in a such short period of time .
I'm beyond happy and pleased to be quite honest since this course reveals and uncovers many extremely helpful tools that we can use on daily basics in our lives and which will also come with great benefits and results to us , so therefore I would really like to cease this opportunity in order to applaud and show my big and sincere gratitude to whoever has  contributed to the success of this splendid work !"
2017-09-10 00:00:00,Taufiq P,5.0,0.0,"A great course, divided into mini digestible parts that any person can grasp. Although sometimes it stated some obvious things, but that does not, in any way, lessen the impact of this course on forming a wider perspective towards learning. What I really loved is that, during and after finishing this course, I started to implement what I learnt here to other fields and in my daily life. I felt happier when I could relate the things they said while actually doing  day to day chores. Maybe that was the main objective of this course, use this to better other parts of your life."
2017-09-24 00:00:00,Andrew,5.0,0.0,"Wonderful course!  I am a student that has been diagnosed with severe ADHD.  My goal going into this course was to find a few techniques that would help me along the way but I found so much more here!  
First, the instructors are clear and concise; giving just the right amount of information that you need to comprehend the material.  I was certainly able to understand the techniques and have been able to apply them successfully to various parts of my life. I cannot thank you enough for putting this course out there as I can truly say that it has changed my life.  Thank you!!"
2015-08-29 00:00:00,Agnieszka,5.0,0.0,"Very professional course, thank you for that! The only thing I was missing in this course was how to learn in non-academical conditions. How to find time if you work 8 hours per day and come home tired while you have prepare something to eat and so on...? How to motivate yourself if there is no test, if you are learning only for yourself? How you can practice that what you are learning if you are doing something completely different in your professional life? These are questions for that I really need an answer, the rest I know from your course, big thank you once again! :)"
2015-08-15 00:00:00,Jennifer,5.0,0.0,"This is an incredible course that gives insight on techniques to improve learning, and also helps you develop a better understanding of your learning style. Professor Oakley has a great lecture style and she also includes many other resources, such as interviews with academics of all different fields and even our fellow classmates,  and plenty of reading material. Professor Oakley makes great connections from the material to real-life situations, and she shares some anecdotes and experiences, which really makes for a fun class setting.   
I recommend this course to everyone!

2020-08-29 00:00:00,Mitzi C,5.0,0.0,"Taking this course has changed my all my pre-existing views about learning thus allowing me to be the best learner I can be. Our lovely professors will teach you about how your brain works, giving you more insights on how to take better control of your learning. Learning is something we do lifelong, and I think that taking this course will really change your life and your approach. This is not just about ""academic"" learning or ""learning in school""; this will really change your outlook and teach you all the things you deserve to know that weren't taught to us anywhere else."
2020-04-22 00:00:00,Amitabh S,5.0,0.0,"Learning how to learn is an exceptionally well planned & executed course. For people who have like yours truly are pursuing a degree, also the same is very beneficial. To loosely refer to one of the quotes from the this course that I have completed , If we are thrown into the water and we do not know how to swim is akin to trying to learn something new without learning to learn. I thank Coursera & University of California to literally teaching me to swim (in the ocean of learning) & now its upto me to swim ashore or may I add cross the channel. Much Thanks & most grateful."
2020-04-19 00:00:00,Miran d,5.0,0.0,I have been in the work force for over 30 years and need to take courses to upgrade my skills. I decided to take this course to help understand the techniques that would help improve my chances of retaining the information that I'm learning in other courses. I enjoyed taking this course as it was fun and easy to understand the concepts and material being introduced. I recommend this course to anyone who think only their method of learning is perfect for them. You will realize that there are other methods that are much easier to implement. Thank you for this amazing course.
2020-02-14 00:00:00,Gillian H,5.0,0.0,"Inspiring!
There are truly no limits to what you can learn and achieve. Find out how you can move on from the limitations that you, or others, might have placed on you because of your earlier academic performance or the subjects that you have studied. 
This course will also show you how to best utilize your study time to get the best results. Some of the principles taught can be used beyond the classroom and can help in other areas of your life.
The course content is always interesting and I've thoroughly enjoyed the bonus interview material.
Thank you for an excellent course!"

I hope to use this knowledge for the many topics I still wish to learn throughout my life and also to teach my girls how to learn better . Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for sharing your knowledge with the world. Learning is one of the most fulfilling and empowering experiences one can have. Thank you for encouraging and making this experience accessible to anyone who wishes to pursue it.

2015-08-27 00:00:00,Dermot P D,5.0,0.0,"I have given this course 5 stars even though I think that there is room for improvement in the videos.  At times it feels like I am watching somebody reading slowly from an autocue/teleprompter.   Apart from this I would recommend this course to everyone.  I would even like to see Coursera have it linked directly to their landing web page.  After all, this site is all about learning, and making sure that everybody is approaching the learning process as well prepared as possible is in everybody's best interest (including Coursera and those that create the course material)."
2018-05-11 00:00:00,YUANYUAN L,5.0,0.0,"I have learned the really powerful techniques to tackle procrastination in this course. Time plan is really useful and efficient. Write down the task list for the next day is really helpful for me to keep thing on track.  Review the task list to mark the unfinished work is also important. Before taking this course, I always waste time on trying to remember what to do at the beginning of a day. And I always begin to do a task without finishing it, then forget it totally. This is the only course I have persisted to finish all the quiz. The feeling of fulfilment is amazing."
2017-08-31 00:00:00,Muhammad S K,5.0,0.0,  This MOOC will change your mindset about learning. I have learned a lot about learning during this course. It is well-structured. I loved the optional readings and interviews because these helped me gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.I have unintentionally practised some of the methods taught in this course in the past and I would endorse them like spaced repetition helps you recall materials much quicker and working on difficult problems helps you become a better and faster problem solver.I hope to incorporate the teachings from this course in my study routine.  
2020-06-25 00:00:00,Nufile U A,5.0,0.0,"Hands down one of the best courses I have ever taken. The reason I found the course extremely helpful is because even before taking the course, some of the techniques discussed were implemented in my study routines and they helped me boost my grades significantly. So naturally, when I find those techniques and many others that I wasn't aware of in the course material, I am assured that I am in the right place. Also Dr. Oakley radiates such a warm and encouraging vibe that that makes you want to have some patience and take tiny steps toward your learning goals! 
Loved it!

2019-05-25 00:00:00,Molly M H,5.0,0.0,"I'm a bad learner, and have never been a teacher favorite. I've struggled with procrastination for my entire life and it has knocked me down over and over. I found the tips in this course to be helpful, and relevant. I started this course to give myself the best chance in a college program, and I even started it with a bad attitude. After finishing the first week, I'm so excited to put what I've already learned into action, and I really feel a connection to Barbra Oakly, guys shes a northern badass. Thanks for this course, you've got this bad student on the right track."
2017-05-17 00:00:00,Richard K,5.0,0.0,"Looking for something different that will increase your knowledge of new areas?  Consider taking this course.  One of the most fundamental skills that people are not taught is how to learn.  This course will give you some very insightful insights about how to be a more effective learner.  Topics such as memory loss, procrastination, connecting ideas, sleep, and so forth are covered on this.  It is an easy course that does not require a lot of time, but will be valuable for learners.  My learning abilities greatly increased after taking this course.  Highly recommended!"
2015-09-07 00:00:00,Marie-Louise B,5.0,0.0,"I absolutely love this course. I have studied Positive Psychology and are working with children with learning disabilities. Everybody can learn and succeed with these tools... Regardless age, regardless ""labeled with learning disabilities"". Im personally deeply fascinated by the brain and I am very fond of the explaining of the brain in the course, which explain so perfectly, why we act as we do.... And for children (or families) with working disabilities they need more than anyone to understand why they act like they do.
EVERYONE CAN LEARN.....EVERYONE CAN FLOURISH.... "
2020-12-11 00:00:00,Lau M,5.0,0.0, I started this course because I was spending a lot of time procrastinating and for me was very difficulty have concentration in finish my task on time.What I found in the information and concepts below help my mind and me to be better with my projects and studies.I began in use the pomodoro technic in most of my activities and the results are amazing and stunning.I feel less anxiety thinking in the process and not in the product.Understanding how works my brain in terms of distraction or building memory can improve myself in choose a better way to do every assignment.  
2019-07-13 00:00:00,Mohamed K B,5.0,0.0,"a life changing course! During the course i have changed many small habits that were keeping me from reaching my personal and professional goals. By understanding how the minds works, you can trick it by setting rewards and following well studied anti-procrastination methods.
During the course i was also listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson podcast, which made a lot of sense in according to this course's material, so if you're looking for an extreme change to your life, take this course, listen to Jordnan Peterson, and you'll be a different person within weeks.
Thnak you!"

I am looking to change my career and trying to learn computer programming and which is exactly why I have done this course. After finishing the course, I believe it is not only my study that is being helped, I believe I have got a very good amount of real life tips as well which will help me in my career as well. Being a procrastinator, I have harmed my life already a lot. But now that I know how to handle procrastination, I will try my best to implement the tricks that I have learned in this course. Thanks a lot!   "
2016-11-06 00:00:00,Dylan D,5.0,0.0,"Learning How To Learn will get you to think differently about procrastination and what you can do about it now. Do yourself a favor. If you are struggling to understand tough subjects or suffer like most people from procrastination, this course will offer a fresh perspective on why we do what we do and what you can change to turn it around. This course should be mandatory in high school or for first year incoming college students. You will walk away learning at least one new thing that will help you to improve your studies, test taking and performing under pressure.  
"
2016-03-04 00:00:00,Andriy G,5.0,0.0,"It is a wonderful course that indeed makes the difference. Over it ""I've met myself"" almost in each video and each topic. Very surprisingly that somebody knows me better than I do and is searching for sintific solutions of my problems in a daily professional fashion. I did realize a lot of things about myself and how things work for or against me, how to reinforce my cons and extract maximum efficiency of pros. How much learning means and how strongly influences human beings. All from the above will be essential for you if you wish to upgrade yourself and your life.   "
2022-09-01 00:00:00,Sally D,5.0,0.0,"I have studied successfully for many exams in different subjects over the years and when this was suggested to me as an option to do before undertaking a new degree subject I was sceptical/dismissive as ""I knew how to learn"" already.  How wrong I was! This course was fantastic. It has taught me some excellent new techiques and theories, shown me why what I have done naturally has worked previously and how what I have also done has slowed down and lengthened my learning process.  Moving forward I hope to be a more efficient/productive and creative student. Thank you"
2021-09-10 00:00:00,Ambur F,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course. I now have tools to help me learn mathematics for a career that I love. I am interested in marketing and data analytics. In order to obtain a degree in this field I would need to take classes in statistics and other types of math that I thought I could not do. I am now more confident because of the tips I have obtained through this class. I have also been able to keep up in my present data analytics class with these techniques. Learning to Learn is one of the most informative empowering classes that I have taken. 
I appreciate Barbara Oakley. "
2020-06-11 00:00:00,Fiona O,5.0,0.0,"Really enjoyed this course and it helped me get back into learning during lockdown! Very effective format and really helped me understand and unlock more about how the brain works to learn (or try to not learn) and what I can do to get myself out of those procrastination ruts and to switch off from things I think I have no aptitude for when actually it's all about my efforts. Barbara was an excellent Teacher and Facilitator, loved her insightful and interesting explanations that kept me engaged throughout the course. Loved this so much I've signed up for Mindshift!"
2021-07-06 00:00:00,norbert b,5.0,0.0,"Great course, i would recommend it to all human beings. Prof Babara Oakey and Prof Terrance Sejnoskwi are great facilitators of learning. Their presentation materials are well done. The course was so captivating, when i started a module, i could stop till i take the examinations. The examination were challenging so you had to understand the topic well to pass it. This is the best course on learning, the neuroscience in it, rubbishes that old and tired theories of learning that we have taught for years. It does explain how people learn. Thanks  for the sponsorship."
2021-04-21 00:00:00,JOSE T M,5.0,0.0,"I recommend this course to anyone, mostly to high school students. Why, math is a subject that most of them say hate or don't understand; however, Dr. Barbara Oakley's testimony is on of inspiration and motivation. I got through the course in order to motivate my daughter but...guess what? - I learned a lot myself. So I bought the book, ""A Mind for Numbers"" along with the Audio, same with, ""Learning How to Learn"" and ""Mindshift."" Reason for that, I recommend it to every parent I know and friends too and is always good to have the book as a good reference material. "
2020-10-04 00:00:00,Ivan C C I,5.0,0.0,"I love the course, I am a procrastinative person but with studying through the course I realized I could do so much more. This process wasn't boring, in fact it was made easy! It was like learning something you're interested in, and I wasn't even all too interested in the beginning. It made me feel (and know!) what it's like to learn and gave me things and techniques to look out for in my study habits. Not only in studying in academe but in learning in life, by having this beautifully made 'manual' to the brain I am thankful. Cheers to a brighter fulfilled future!"
2020-04-11 00:00:00,Maninder S,5.0,0.0,"First and foremost, Thanks to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski and the team for creating such a wonderful course.
This is the first course that i've completed on Coursera. It has completely changed my mindset and how i approach my life day to day. This course may seem like it's just useful if you are preparing for a test, but it's much more than that. You'd have different techniques to tackle out some fundamental problems, like Procrastination, Lack of interest in new things, afraid of new areas be it in your current field or a new career altogether.
Highly recommended."
2018-01-18 00:00:00,See Y C,5.0,0.0,"This course is condensed in such a way, with amazing visual cues and guides, that it is very easy to understand and commit to memory. The videos are short enough, such that it is very easy to schedule breaks inbetween. It is also such that each video is neither too long or too short, fitting the length of one's attention span. Overall, the attention to detail, both within and outside the contents of the course (i.e the content itself and the way it is structured) is masterfully developed for easy understanding. The course is amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone."
2015-10-27 00:00:00,Revol R,5.0,0.0,"C'est le cours qu'on devrait suivre avant tout autre chose. Des vidéos claires (sous titrées pour les non anglophones), dans un format compact, des astuces pour l'apprentissage et la mémorisation tellement évidentes au final quand on y pense, mais tellement efficace. 
That's the course we should complete before anything else. Clear videos (subtitled for non english speaking people), un a compact form, tips & tricks for learning and memory which are so obvious finally where we look back at them, but so usefull. 
Bravo and thank you very much for publishing this MOOC."
2017-10-15 00:00:00,Michael G,5.0,0.0,"Wow! This course came just at the right time in my life. Unemployed and doubting my own self-confidence, I had internalized all my failures as innate reflections of who I am––a failure. This course taught me (and in some points, re-taught me) the neuroscience, psychology and physiology of how human leverage their greatest evolutionary advantage, learning. Having completed this course, I've regained much of my self-confidence, and I am, once again, ready to get back out in the world, now knowing, I am capable, with hard work and perseverance, of learning anything. "
2017-06-08 00:00:00,Jamelah M,5.0,0.0,I love how friendly Dr. Oakley appears to be. She is always so excited about the material it automatically makes me more interested in what she has to say. I think sharing her background and struggles made her down-to-earth and made me feel like if she can do it I can do it too. Many professors act as if they are high and mighty and that you could never be as intelligent as they are. Dr. Oakley showed me through her personal story and her teaching material that if I use the tips and techniques I've learned through both of her courses I can truly learn ANYTHING!!!
2016-09-21 00:00:00,EL K D,5.0,0.0,"Thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terry Sejnowski for this amazing course.
This course was very challenging for me because I haven't studied for 20 years and it was my first english specific course with an anglophone university ...
 You definitively changed my way of thinking about learning and my life thanks to all these mental tools...
learning how the brain works, how to built more neurons and to strenghten them was amazing... I discovered Neuroscience and I love it.
Learning has become for me an evidence because it opens our mind ... 
So thank you very much :-)

2021-05-07 00:00:00,Margarita G,5.0,0.0,"  I took this course on May 2021.I think it's a great MOOC: the information is structured very carefully, each video is helpful, you can learn 1-2 hours a day and do everything in time.Mentors always cheer you up, and there's plenty of fellow learners you can speak with.I personally felt an everyday craving to sit and learn - it's so exciting to discover how your brain works!Course provide a giant amount of additional information so you can deepen into subjects you more interested in.I really started to tackle procrastination and fear of learning more effectively.

2021-01-14 00:00:00,Orian W,5.0,0.0,"The course is beneficial and relevant to these days that we humans are overwhelmed with so much from the world we are living. People like me lacks in understanding how our brain works which led us to our inability to fully explore our potentials in the different facets of our lives. I truly appreciate everything that was taught and presented here in this course, and I will try my best to put into practice and be mindful of the relevance of learning and how the mind works. Taking this course will make you realize how much of it is applicable in our everyday life."
2018-07-28 00:00:00,Kyle C,5.0,0.0,"I wish I could have taken this course at the beginning of high school. While I always did well enough in school, part of me truly believed there were some things I just couldn't do well because I didn't ""get"" them. This course set me straight. Learning takes time and practice - the people we think are the ""smartest"" or ""most successful"" are often the ones who work hard and focus on doing better. It sounds cliché, but I realized upon completing this course that my own fear of failure has prevented me from learning some really hard (and often meaningful) subjects. "
2017-03-27 00:00:00,Louise E,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course that you can apply to a broad number of things. From learning a new hobby, to acing an exam. I've been slowly applying what I've learned even during taking the course. I know understand my brain better, and see the cues of procrastination and have been better at avoiding them—but still fall into the trap. I feel like a much more functional human being just from taking this course, and have already gotten over a work slump that I having trouble with (a difficult project that I've been putting off was completed by doing the Pomodoro Method.)"
2022-06-25 00:00:00,Alessandro S,5.0,0.0,"It's really a very important, effective and useful course that everyone should take.
In this course, all aspects of learning have been covered in a very interesting and simple way. you will learn more about how your brain works, how your memory is going on and how you can improve it. You will learn very useful studying techniques that will help you learn more effectively like chunking, pomodoro technique, Anki flashcards, spaced repetition, recall, frequent testing and To-Do list. You will also learn about how to overcome the enemy of all of us, procrastination  "
2020-08-10 00:00:00,Tripta B,5.0,0.0,  It has been a wonderful experience learning about the learning processes. One can easily see the amount of work done behind to get all these ideas together. The instructors both were highly dedicated to this work and I can see there efforts through the massive amount of research papers reviewed while forming this course materials. I found the course to be very helpful in changing my perspective on the process of learning and cannot thank enough for including the interviews of such highly ambitious different thinking peoples. Thank you for preparing this course.  
2020-05-23 00:00:00,venkatesh m,5.0,0.0,"  I am very happy to share my feelings about this course, before this course I have my own methods of reading and preparing in that some are helpful and most of them are not, after completion of the course I have understood the structerd way of learning. How foucused mode and diffused modes of thingking works. The interviews with some of great minds also inspires me a lot.
 Not but not the least Thaks to Dr. Barbara Okley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for providing such a wonderful and helpful lecture series. Finaly thanks to the total team of Learnig How to Learn...  "
2017-06-29 00:00:00,Rohan P,5.0,0.0,"This was an amazing course, that not only help deepen my understanding of the brain, but also my own brain and how I work. It's hard to really delve into graduate level course work, especially in a high stakes field like medicine. As I go through medical school, I realize that I am doing well to get A's or B's on my exams. But that isn't helping me fully deepen my knowledge. I'm really good at just recall. But this course helped me understand how to really improve my memory and my understanding of a subject, and not just regurgitate the information on an exam. "
2020-10-31 00:00:00,Preetika K,5.0,0.0,"This was hands down one of the best courses I have ever done. Do not hesitate, I am practically begging you to do this course! The course was so interesting and had my attention throughout. I wish this content was taught to students early on as it makes a world of a difference knowing how you can learn better, not only academically but also in general life. I would like to wholeheartedly thank the instructors of this course, it wouldn't have been the same with anyone else. The quirky little edits and details in quiz questions made the course that much better. "
2020-04-09 00:00:00,linnea S,5.0,0.0,"Thank you SO MUCH ! This has been GREAT! I have learned so much about myself and my former destructive habits. With the insights from this course, I'm now starting to build up new skills that I have been dreaming of for years. Instead of blacking out when I meet obstacles or challenges, I move forward overcome them - and incredibly GROW STONGER! This course has served me not only with power study skills, but as way to understand myself and how to work with my competences in a more enjoyable and creative way. This course has changed my F''' lyfe. You rock BARB "
2018-09-07 00:00:00,Pablo,5.0,0.0,"This was one of the best courses I've ever had here, on Coursera. I could think out of the box and also help my students to achieve different ways of studying English. I saw different approaches in learning tough subjects that I study by my own, and I also shared with my students to help them how to study, following the Hard start - jump to easy method; the benefits of sleeping to learn better; the chunk formation, and other powerful tools you'd shared in this course. Thanks Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and all the team that made this course."
2017-10-23 00:00:00,Alejandro G,5.0,0.0,"  I wish I had taken this course when I started school. Put in better words an adequate version based on age and grade of study. This is definitely something that has to be taught to students in some degree to provide them with tools on how to learn and study better.That would take most of any negative connotation related to school, homework, testing and studying. Not only teaching and learning would be better and easier but also the level of performance would be astronomically greater.Hands down one of the best courses I've taken so far!! strongly recommended!  "
2017-04-25 00:00:00,Carlos E P V,5.0,0.0,"Make yourself a favor, just take the course. I have done a lot of the opposite of what I should have done. Barbara Oakley is so nice to explain to you, every video is easy to muster and follow. The course is not solely study techniques in the conventional form, the most valuable parts are how our brain solves problems and the basic chemistry that affects it. I enjoyed, I have not finished watching the optional videos but I will and even bought the book. Definitely will review it often or as Dr Barbara said ""try to recall"" big parts of it and learn it deeply."
2020-07-24 00:00:00,Almyn C A,5.0,0.0,"This is an amazing course. While deceptively short, it holds a wealth of information about learning and the science behind it. What I like the most are the optional videos and readings. I think half the time I spent on this course was spent reading blogs, articles, scientific journal articles, and reading video transcripts from optional resources. While some of the tips seemed to me, at first, pedantic and repetitive, learning the science behind them instilled in me new appreciation for them. This course was also a great reminder why I truly enjoy learning."
2019-05-11 00:00:00,Ramon M,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course. Being 78, I have developed during the years, mainly by trial and error, some learning techniques.
It is very rewarding to find out the reasons why some work, and learn many other, some counterintuitive, ways of improving concentration, avoid procrastination, and get better at passing tests.
Course is very clearly explained, has ample bibligraphy to further develop any subject of particular interest, and presents interviews with people who have either developed or succeeding in applying these techniques in defferent fields.
Highly recommended"
2016-09-28 00:00:00,Maribeth C Y,5.0,0.0,"This is a marvelous course. Lectures sent my enthusiasm into deeper learning at additional resources many time. I have recommended the course to peers (retired) and to parents of struggling youth, as well as to folks who need to master new skills. Oakley is fantastic and so down-to-earth and real. Never enjoyed a course more, and will probably go thru it again to refresh periodically. Highly recommended for anyone to wants to get a handle on the pragmatic steps to getting something into your head! Let Oakley take you by the hand, you won't regret the time."

Just finished the course and I'm very impressed. I came to the conclusion that I had many pits in learning. This course offered me the opportunity to pinpoint these obstacles. It further widened my insight into what learning is all about and how to maximize benefit from learning any topic. Throughout the course, I've done many tasks that either involve me learning new material or ticking off some points off my to-do list. To my surprise, I was able to finish off many tasks and learn in a non labored and efficient way. Learning became rather interesting!!!

2018-05-10 00:00:00,Mike,5.0,0.0,"During this course i've had the pleasure of deepening my understanding of memory tools I knew of, and learning about memory tools I had never heard of before. The course has a very logical and easy to follow program. Applying everything you learn, will definitely help you in life as you seek to broaden your horizons.

I took this course because i wanted to take other courses after this one and starting here seemed to be the most logical thing to do. I recommend learning how to learn to anyone who has no idea what learning is beyond reading stuff in a books."
2022-09-22 00:00:00,Ella M,5.0,0.0,"T​his course was eye opening as a student dealing with a lot of the discussed ""learning blocks"" or bad habits of learning. It was very helpful for me to see the chemical processes of the way the brain deals with all of the information from learning, which helped me to form a better study plan to coincide with it. I found the lectures to be entertaining, and the quizzes engaging and well suited for pre-final preparation. I would highly recommend this course to any student or individual who would like to improve their ability and understanding of learning."

2019-08-29 00:00:00,Aleksa G,5.0,0.0,"An amazing course which should be obligatory in every high-school. Learning how to learn in the early stage of your life (especially before you start going to the faculty) can be invaluable. Some people are ""lucky"" enough to find their own methods (which work amazing for them) during their learning journey, as was the case with me, but we should make it systematic by integrating it into the official school system! And even for people that already have success with learning, we can always learn new and useful tips & tricks, as I did finishing this course."
2019-08-01 00:00:00,Gyorgy G,5.0,0.0,"I found it very interesting, came in well-sized portions (chunks) on an easy-to-understand way. You do not need to be master in neuroscience to understand and it actually showed some useful techniques what resonated with my past experience in learning.  I try to get my son to complete it as I would have benefited a lot from this knowledge if I had the opportunity to learn how to learn when I was in his age.
Thanks a lot for Barb

I've taken away many practical tools to help me better learn, most notably the pomadoro technique and allowing myself diffuse thinking when writing. This latter tool, by turning my screen black when I type, has been a huge help to get my out of Einstellung  and the focus/edit mode which can prohibit my writing and leave me stuck.

It has helped me build mental calibre to approach learning new things while being excited about it rather than having any kind of fear. The course is very insightful and will make one realize every single damn thing they have been doing wrong while learning. Lastly, the learnings from this course is going to stay with me for the rest of my life and I am gonna learn everything more effectively.

Dr. Oakley teaches techniques to use, the best methods for using them, and the reasoning behind them. During the course, both instructors apply techniques to varying subjects and varying levels of study. I enjoyed this course both for the serious science and practical information, and for the levity and enthusiasm with which the instructors approached the topic. The further reading references were very helpful and thought provoking, as well."

It could have saved my a lot of time had I learned it growing up, not to mention that I could have earned better grades as well. Thanks to Barbara and Terry, the current and future generations can benefit from the research and the ways of learning they put together. I want to point out that the course caters to a broad audience, so it does not go into the depths. Some of the reading materials they put down are great. It is worthwhile to read them.  "

Now, I just have to get every, single human I know and love to take the course next time it's offered. (Thank God that's only a week or so away!)  I'm going to take it again, too.  It's changed my life once, and I've got this feeling that if I give the information a second go-over, it may change my life at an even deeper level."

J'ai appris des nouveaux concepts formidables et je vais aussi pouvoir corriger certaine mauvaise habitue ou illusion que j'avais.
Ce cours est une grande générosité, il permet aussi de constater à travers les entrevues, que même si vous êtes un peu différent de la masse, vous pouvez vous accomplir à des niveaux d'élite.

All of them not only cover concept but help to explain on how to turn them into actions, which are very helpful.This course should greatly help students, but even if you aren't a student, I still believe it's beneficial as we all need to learn new things (especially in this world of rapid change).Highly recommend to give it a try!

Some of the tips resonated with what I've been hearing about education & learning since my growing up days, but I wouldn't have known what my deficiencies/drawbacks had I not taken this course. This course made me reflect about myself & my methods. As Prof. Oakley has stressed in this course, ""One has to take responsibility for his/her own learning"" and I would highly recommend this course. Happy Learning !!!"

It's a great course and the instructors are the type of professors you can easily get along with. It's an easy four week course and I highly recommend this as a first course for the first timers as it will be a good reminder that learning isn't just about reading books or making notes. It's also how you put that knowledge in your life and how to deeply ingrain it in one's mind for a long time.

They have given lots of practical and interesting suggestions to improve our learning. They are so simple techniques that we do sometime unknowingly or saw someone doing it, but we ignore it most of the time. 
Now that we can see what they do actually to our learning , we ca kind of hack the mid to learn the stuff we need.

The great techniques put forth from test taking to tips on avoiding procrastination, to the memory palace for remembering lists and focusing on process and not on results were were very well put forward  in this class.
I am a 60 year old adult, who has lost  complete faith that she can read and learn.  This class has given me courage to move on and has given me a great sense of accomplishment. And has also taught me a lot along the way.

It's tips on memory, how to beat procrastination, and the use of focused and diffuse attention modes, as well as the diferences between working memory and long term memory and how they work, without forgetting the best ways of learning and the not so effective common practices called illusions of competence really were very helpful ideas that I'm decided to review them in spared days of the week to best retain them in my mind

It changed my way of thinking (gradually not suddenly) and the way I receive things.It helps me see things from a big picture like for example if you're struggling with material , it is not the end of the world , you just have a good sleep and come back tomorrow in which you would find the material much easier . It helps you tackle procrastination and memory issues and addresses you with simple yet power techniques you can master subject.Thank you Barabara,I loved her so much  "

This course fills this gap and provides opportunity to take a step back and relate to what your process of learning has been what you have been missing. I am sure after completing this you will walk out with new tools, better understanding of your own learning methods and apply more consciously and confidently what you learn here in improving your PROCESS of your learning!"

You can work it through with not much time on your hand and if you want to deepen your understanding of the subject there is a lot of optional recourses to work through. The not optional content is cut down to its most important information.
The two instructors are really passionate about their subjects and present it in an informative way assisted by analogies, mnemonics and multimedia.
Only thing that is probably my preference is that Barbara Oakley talking feels slow, which can be adjusted by video speed."

2020-05-20 00:00:00,Janaka J,5.0,0.0,"Fantastic Course. Definietly I changed my thinking pattern and the way look into my problems and learning completely changed. I believe through out the years I have done and gone through the completely wrong pathway. I had to make lot of efforts to get through my exams and now I know the reason. If I listen to this vedios earlier I may be a different person with lot of achievements. I do think every teacher, professor, lecturer , student should do this course. Can't even imagine that such a world class course is available free of charge. "

J'y ai trouvé toute une série d'outils et méthodes pour être plus efficace dans l'apprentissage comme dans le travail au quotidien. J'ai mieux compris comment le cerveau fonctionne, et comment je peux mieux utiliser son potentiel. J'ai aussi noté des ""trucs"" pratiques que j'ai déjà mis en œuvre au quotidien, et pas seulement dans le travail ! je l'ai suivi en anglais, mais il y avait des documents de référence traduits en français

Many practical techniques were also presented, which I will utilize in future coursework and will also share with my colleagues.  The professors were interesting and gave information in logical sequences enabling easier recall.  Frequent quizzes also supported the acquisition of new ideas and concepts.  Many thanks to Drs. Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski."
2020-04-12 00:00:00,Hem P,5.0,0.0,"As I took this course, I realized if I could have taken it years ago, would have definitely helped me for my undergrads. The process of learning is so important, we are just focused on the product. I believe the techniques that I learned from this course will help me for my further studies, as learning never stops throughout the life. I am planning to study Data Structure course for job interview, this course will help me for my career growth.

2020-05-26 00:00:00,Deepti,5.0,0.0,"Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have been my best mentors to date. The way the whole course has been designed with its contest, tests, quizzes, assignments - everything has been designed to practice what is been taught, put it to practical application, learn from the mistakes, and ace better. I have been applying the techniques to my life now and it has made a remarkable difference with the way I use my time. Learning has turned far more efficient! Thank you so much for this well-designed course! It has changed my life!!!"
2019-07-26 00:00:00,Ricki M,5.0,0.0,"An excellent summary of the latest research into how we learn. As well as introducing the theory the learning approaches and tactics presented make it a highly practical course. Although I'm now past the stage of formal education, I'm still finding applying the skills I've learned in this course very useful in my approach to learning new skills, whether at work or at home. I would highly recommend this course to anyone, whether in school, college or university, or like me just looking to continue learning in your job and personal life."
2017-10-09 00:00:00,Elena P,5.0,0.0,"  This course is well structured and grabs your interest from the beginning. If you go through the course, you learn some valuable learning techniques, as well as methods for fighting the procrastination and overcoming the frustration that sometimes we all get.I was already using some of the highlighted methods of learning, but I did not know that there were some special techniques that are proved to be more effective to learn something new. The course helped me to see the studying process from new perspective and make it more conscious.  "
2020-09-30 00:00:00,Kyle C D,5.0,0.0,"  The learning techniques and how the brain works that can be learned from this course is very insightful. I particularly like the mnemonic and memory palace techniques because I want to improve my memory and creativity. I tried applying some of the techniques into my studies and I can say that I have retained what I learned better because I am less stressed due to sufficient sleep and the diffused mode of thinking as the course has taught. The things taught here can even be applied to lifelong learning, so overall, it's a great course!  "
2020-06-04 00:00:00,Luis C J,5.0,0.0,"This course touched on a plethora of researched material that, if applied, will undoubtedly make your learning more effective. The knowledge and tools that this course has shared will, without a doubt, make my journey in life much more enriching. As humans, we are curious, and through curiosity, we learn and create new synapses in our minds. Having taken a course that assists in effectuating this learning process will prove priceless in the days ahead.

It presents basic neuroscience topics as they relate to learning, memory and test taking in a simple and approachable way. It also encourages you to reflect often throughout the course so that you think of ways to apply the concepts to your own experiences. The instructor is an expert and is a great speaker that keeps you engaged. I enjoyed listening to the videos while driving my car, and because of the course's good structure and assessments, feel I internalized much of the information well."

Now it is amazing to me to discover that not only was I correct, but that there are some very concrete, evidence based, efficient and simple methods by which to become an excellent student. Time spent has always been important, but the opportunity to make any time spent well worth the investment is invaluable. Truly excellent course, that I have already and will continue to recommen

2016-06-10 00:00:00,Dean B,5.0,0.0,"Throw out your old ideas about learning and studying!   No more cramming, re-reading, or excessive highlighting.  Bring on the self-testing, deliberate practice, and interleaving.  And don't forget to get some descent sleep and exercise, too.
The concepts I learned through this class are already paying dividends for me.  The material is presented in short video segments that allow time for your brain's diffuse mode to help you along.  I also browsed through the optional interviews and readings which are excellent.  
Highly recommended! "
2019-05-02 00:00:00,Adam V,5.0,0.0,"This course provides phenomenally powerful tools for improving your ability to learn, as well as a deeper understanding of the best available models for how our brains work. All of the material is backed by scientific research, which is well-cited throughout the course. The instructors are both entertaining and informative, creating a really great learning environment. I have recommended this course to all of my friends, though I can't recommend it highly enough. You owe it to yourself to make this the next course that you complete."
2017-12-03 00:00:00,Paul B,5.0,0.0,"After 50 years of learning there is still much to learn about how to learn!  This course describes some of the brain's mechanisms related to learning and prescribes tips and methods to overcome frequently encountered impediments to learning; such as procrastination, over-learning, einstellung, illusions of competence, etc.  Presented in a joyous style by Dr's Oakley, and Sejnowski, makes you want to dust off the old Calculus text to see what you missed the first time around.  Wonderful for the wide-eyed young and the young at heart!"

When I presented this problem to my friends, I was recommended by one of them to this course and it was really an enjoyable experience. Now I am more able to remember the things I am learning and finally I loved Dr. Barbara Oakley she was more than a friend she felt me as i'm home. Dr. Terrence Sejnowski was totally academic i felt it in this way but it was also interesting since i still an academic student so it felt me comfortable

2020-10-18 00:00:00,abdullah,5.0,0.0,"Don't procrastinate.  Stop it. Say I am going to work 25 mins. then break and relax. While learning, understand the core concepts, give some time, or few days. Come back and check your understanding, Learn at interleaved intervals; Sleep well for your brain to be super-functional. Walk, jog, breathe fresh air. Let your creative part of the brain stimulate. You can learn new concepts ! You can!! Those interviews... really cool part of coursera, you need to hear from the experts.Thanks Barbara and Dr.S. and Coursera, Simply Amazing!!"
2020-08-03 00:00:00,Dwight W,5.0,0.0,"The two Drs. Oakley and Seg were perfect, no distracting mannerism or verbal quirks. I like there slow mature deliveries and how the projected verbal content was totally in sync with the graphics content. The voluntary readings at the conclusion of a week's material were insightful and force multiplier to the course. Please keep that feature. As I intend to take advantage of my work furlough during Covid the tools of Learning How to Learn were the right mix before starting a more ambitious learning routine going forward. Thank you!"

Tools and resources are in abundance as well. Learn how to learn, and specifically, learn how YOU learn, so that you can set yourself up for the successes we crave. The above is a pre-made paragraph that I felt no need in changing because it's all true. I desired mental tools to help me learn and find consistency and discipline in my successes.

Gently presented so that My confidence has not been undermined and with the frequent testing to help me gain confidence has now enabled me to look to furthering my studies. 
Coursera has come up with a fine platform and as I have no funds I feel I am free to explore in my own time to a point where I am confident enough to look for funding to fulfill my dreams of a new life. 

Thank You so Much "
2015-12-13 00:00:00,Prathamesh P,5.0,0.0,This is perhaps one the most useful and essential course that I have came across. This is for everyone who wants to and love to learn things not just for the sake of doing it but for understanding the nuances of it and making it permanent. I could appreciate many ideas from this course those I were already practicing in studies and made me think of ideas I were lacking while I used to study. I am definitely going to apply as much approaches mentioned in this course as possible in my studies. Thanks for making a such a good course.

2018-05-09 00:00:00,Lukas J M,5.0,0.0," I have recently received an EdD in adult education and as a result have learned a lot of theories of adult learning. This course really enlightened me to the biology of learning and helps me better understand the ``why`` of the theories and how many of them, seemingly unrelated on the surface, really complement each other.  I appreciate they way the content was delivered, in a straight forward, easy to understand format which helps us to master the material quickly and apply it to our lives. 
Thank you Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski!!!"

I really want to congratulate you for this interesting and useful course for the life of each one of the people who take it. In my case personally, if I would like to certify myself, but I do not have the resource and believe me that the effort I had to make to do it was quite great, since I have to take care of my parents who suffer from Alzheimer's and I don't really have time left, but This same course made me correct some things in my daily life and so I could organize myself better and did my best to finish them. Thank you!  "

I'm so happy that this course is my beginning.
according to Dr. Barbra, I did love her way to explain the material, I see she does her best to produce this course to the fullest.
Dr. Sejnowski , I did benefited from all you teach us and hope to learn more from you in the next courses.

Now I have entered the society as a primitive engineer  and I have much less free time in my daily life, which actually inspires me to take advantage of my time. I would treat this course's finishing as a new starting point of my life. Like the last interview said, write your own autograph, and I would try to make it as brilliant as possible."
2017-03-25 00:00:00,Марія С,5.0,0.0,"This course was extremely helpful for me, although I'm already familiar with a lot of concepts and researches about learning. It's well structured and sometimes sims to be to precise, but then it's become obvious, that it follows all the tips it's talking about. So now that I finished it, it's impact on my learning is a matter of practice)
It's also very inspiring to see all of the personal examples (see additional interviews), especially from Dr.Barbara Oakley, since I also didn't expect that I would study math-related subjects."

I knew the problem was not in myself, but my techniques, so I decided I need to spend some time on improving my demolished ways. I had little expectations starting this course, as it was the first online course I had ever started, but I was taken by the quality and style of presenting this information. I had my doubts, but this course was up for the challenge. "
2016-01-07 00:00:00,Ron W,5.0,0.0,"Are you a procrastinator? Participate in this course when you should be doing your ""real"" classes or work. 
Even if you're an expert in all the latest productivity hacks, you'll learn the biological reasons behind such subjects as putting things off and why you may not be learning even though you're covering all the material. 
Once completed, you can apply what you've learned and get down to more efficient learning.
Additionally, it seems that the professors do a good job of keeping the course updated and communicating to students."

I liked all the aspects of the course. One of the aspects which I always put in the lower priority is physical exercise, this course changed my mind, exercise is not waste of time, instead it boosts your learning. I am not here to provide the summary of the course, however my intention is that everyone should take this course, take the learnings, and effectively learn.Happy learning.  "

While I am already a 30-year old professional, all ideas here will help me be a more productive individual optimizing my learning from all that I read and experience. My only regret is not taking this earlier. Even the optional videos are must-see. I recommend this to everyone that are in Coursera to include this on the first courses that they take here. Thank you very much, Dr. Barbara Oakley. I would want a part 2."
2020-08-27 00:00:00,Viviana Z,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course. I learned new techniques to help me study any subject such as chunking, using metaphors and how exercise and sleep are more important than we think when learning new and difficult subjects. I especially enjoyed the different videos from renowned experts in memory retention, brain function and other related videos.  I learned about the focused and diffused mode of thinking and how shifting between the two helps you to think better, be more creative and solve problems. I highly recommend this course."

I enjoyed the explanations of learning physiology as much as the discussion of specific learning strategies and techniques. The supplemental reading and videos are also very worthwhile.
As an educator and constant student, I got a lot from the course and will take it again. I strongly recommend this course to all students, educators and parents. "

Personally I was familiar with many of the learning strategies that are being represent along the course, but together with the explanations of why are thous any good, and the organised way the material is being laid it helps you ""chunk it"" all together  , it did have a big impact on me. And it gave me a lot of motivation and already I feel that I am a better learner and more confidante. Thanks for helping me learning how to learn.   "

I learned many things from this course. I'm not only talking about theories and principles but actual practical lessons I can use in my daily tasks. This course gave me a fresh look on learning and hopefully will allow me to unlearn certain habits. I'm excited to use the tips in my work and share them with students and colleagues. It's worth my time and effort - yours, too!"

I've found ways to improve my learning and rekindled my love of learning - am really thinking about how to apply to my creative writing, but also it's nudged me back into taking up my Tibetan and Spanish learning again. I've used Pomorodo before, as an academic on a writing retreat, enjoyed it, then forgot about it. This course has confirmed - with me testing it in practice - that it really is an effective technique.
Can't recommend enough. "

At the age of 35, I'm gearing up to going back to school o pursue my Master's and this course has got me excited to be studying again.
I love the depth in the topics you've covered, the simple language with which you put across complex medical terms, the humor, the encouragement, the tips, and yes, the zombies.
I will be back in some time to review this course again.

As a child, I had so many negative scripts that I never tried to do good. While doing the course, the tutors rewired my thinking pattern. I feel normal. I am enthusiastic to apply the knowledge. Also, I never wanted this course to end. It felt right to interact with such wonderful teachers."
2020-05-06 00:00:00,Khaled B,5.0,0.0,"This is an absolutely fantastic course in my opinion. I just realized that I have been utilizing extremely bad habits in my studying for so many years. The concepts that I found to be of great help to me are chunking, interleaving, and also the types of human memory (long-term memory, and working memory) as well as how our brains work in relation to procrastination. I highly recommend everyone who is taking the course, to make neat notes for each week, I found this advantageous in retaining much of the content. Peace & love "

Due to my procrastination problem, I enroll for the coursera courses now and then, but middle of the session I drop out from each of the course. This is the first in Coursera that retained my interest to finish the course. I loved the concept of Pomodoro, Chunking techniques that have been taught in this course. I'm looking forward to apply these techniques not only in my professional career but also in my life-long learning process. Happy learning everyone!"

You can imagine how much I suffer from learning and memorizing things and I always suffer from studying and making exams and I hate going to school. This course taught me how to overcome my problem in studying and to memorize things easily It makes me more confident with myself. I found myself going thru the material easily and confidently doing the practice exams.  I wish I had this course before. I'm 63 years old. Thank you for the marvelous course.

After taking this course it really gave me some powerful mental tools that I've never known about, my favorite is the Pomodoro technique and focusing on the process rather than the product.

The sincerity of both professors to provide us all the learning skills and techniques that helped to become who they are was done in a very skillful and comprehensive manner. I wish I would have found this course a bit earlier so that I could have used it during undergrad, and taken out all those preconceptions away about learning things that I felt would be out of my scope in general. Anyhow, better late than never as I always say. Thank you for this, and looking forward to taking more MOOCs as this one. "

It's packed with a lot of resources with a lot of useful and interesting information but you will not feel the time pass by if you want to improve your learning skills and want to know more about the whole learning process, which is very interesting.

Both instructors are engaging and lively, the material is presented in straightforward and clever manners, and it achieves the balance between technical background information and practical techniques.
I would heartily recommend Learning How to Learn to anyone from high school students looking to improve their grades through to adult learners returning to education after an absence and EVERYONE in between."

Now, I have come to know about how my brain works and how it can be managed to do things. I wish I will be able to apply what I have learned in this course. Believe it, it was worthy of time to waste in such a course that won't help you to earn your payscale directly but it will bring a major mind-shift to believe in yourself when you will get to know where you lacked and what do you need."
2017-03-16 00:00:00,Paul M,5.0,0.0,"I found this course for my 12-year-old daughter.  She is starting to get classes that depend on tests for the grade, and she was really unclear how to study effectively.  I decided to take the course also, and my 6-year-old son, who is highly motivated, participated with me.  I got some key benefits from the course, particularly the pomodoro technique, which I am using.  The side benefit to doing this ""as a family"" is that it gives us a vocabulary and common experience around which to discuss learning concepts together.

Really helpful, while learning the course, I recalled of many words that my teachers told me when I was at school. Such as look at the last few questions (the most difficult ones) first during an exam, and recall what I've learnt after each course, they were really helpful, but back then I couldn't understand very clearly so didn't try hard on them. But now I know, and I become more confident with these 'tricks' and become more willing to control my learning process to make it more efficient and enjoyable.
Thanks a lot."

This course also provides a lot of practical information and you know that it's evidence based. It's definitely worth the time and effort to watch all the videos and I recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn something.  More important: This course is mainly focused on academics but it also links the knowledge to everyday learning (skills like cooking great dishes, learn a sport or any other skill really)"
2020-03-22 00:00:00,Wolfram F,5.0,0.0,"Great info, I also read the book to further interleave the learning. In the future I will definitely use techniques presented in this course. One little point of annoyance, for most of the tests, the multiple choose questions contain very clearly right and very clearly wrong answers. In my opinion this makes the effectiveness of taking those tests much less. I think this is a missed opportunity since this course itself speaks so highly about the value of serious test taking. But overall I'm very happy with the course."
2016-01-27 00:00:00,Dotan F,5.0,0.0,"I felt it was mainly fun, and I did talked about the principles and interviews I've seen during the course, so I guess something about the course works!  :)
Also, It helped me understand some of my behaviors (for good and bad) .
There are a few things that were a bit...well...made me go somewhere else for a while during the course:
1.
It took me a while to get used to the lectures tempo. For me - they are a bit too slow.
2.
In many cases - the answers for the question were long. From time to time - It was really exhausting.

2017-02-24 00:00:00,Ruben D,5.0,0.0,"Through this course I learned about the mechanics of the learning, techniques for learning better and also how to retain what we learn in our long-term memory.
The course covers a wide range of topics such as procrastination, different thinking models, the importance of physical activity for your brain among many others.
The course has the contribution of experts and scientists from different domains which I believe that contributes for the overall quality of the program.
I highly recommend everyone to take this course! "
2022-05-05 00:00:00,Evgeniya A,5.0,0.0,"Good afternoon! I am eternally grateful to the authors of the course and all those involved in it. This is the best thing I've learned lately, I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. The course is very exciting and useful, it is literally an instruction to the brain. Awesome! Special thanks, Barbara Oakley she is so friendly that it cannot leave you indifferent. Dr. Terrence SejnowskiThank you for your invaluable knowledge. Thank you for helping people from different countries to be kinder and smarter. Thank you!"
2020-06-22 00:00:00,Sandra M,5.0,0.0,"I found it an amazingly well organised course. It cut no corners. A spade was called a spade. Most things we know but it's good when its re-enforced and we are made to face reality - illusions of competence. We fool ourselves so easily. Its hard hitting and extremely beneficial. I particularly liked the palace technique. It took me a while to actually understand but it was quite astounding how it worked once put into practices.
It was a great course and I am glad I got so much out of it. Thanks to Babara and Terence."
2022-04-19 00:00:00,Andy W,5.0,0.0,"This is a must-take course for any adult learner about to undertake any significant learning activity.

In my humble opinion it should be required material in every degree course and I would not be exaggerating to say that completing it has changed my life.

As an adult learner with ADHD, I found it useful in particular to enhance my self awareness and understanding of how my brain works.

Although I had heard of pomodoro and anki cards before - I did not have a technical understanding of WHY they worked until now.
"
2017-12-04 00:00:00,Keeya V T,5.0,0.0,"The course is very intrinsic in its teaching and i would most definitely recommend to nay student starting out either in their academic career or simply considering one in the near future. Even if it might not be education purposes, it can also be for job as it was in my case. Unfortunately, it was too late on my end, but I look to making changes in the future as advised by my peers in this course. It will teach the reason why slowing down is very important and vital to undertaking as well as mastering of concepts."
2016-10-31 00:00:00,vivek,5.0,0.0,"Absolutely game changing stuff! I always was curious about  figuring out a set of principles that will make my learning more efficient. I used to avidly read the Learning on Steroids material by Scott Young. Although I had known much of the stuff taught on this course, I never had the right structure to put all this in perspective. The much-needed structure is  what this course gave me. I'm currently a broke entrepreneur. But, when the time comes, I want to buy this course as a token of thanks. Thank you, Coursera!"
2015-12-25 00:00:00,Elizabeth H,5.0,0.0,"It is true that there is a broad applicability of the concepts 
presented in the videos.  Using scientific data and concrete examples to
 illustrate points, the instructors truly delivered.  
As a medical student, I find this course really worth investing into.  I
 still am amazed of the things I've learned about learning.  I am 
surprised at how much time and energy I've wasted before studying 
inefficiently.  No wonder I'm burned out time and again.  It was 
delightful embarking on this ship.  Thank you very much!"
2015-08-23 00:00:00,Alex M,5.0,0.0,"Highly recommend to take this as your first MOOC course. Very easy to understand, all topics discuss are presented in an easy, painless manner. The professors have very informative and brief video lectures, and taking the questions and quizzes right after the lectures is very helpful in staying engaged without using up too much of your time. This is coming from a person who has had a hard time with going to school, so the result is very good. Hopefully the other classes are as good and to the point as this one was."
2020-03-21 00:00:00,Leonardo M,5.0,0.0,"An original, interesting, well organized course that sums up many tools that you can casually find on the internet when you get frustated about not learning effectively what you want to learn. It gives useful tips to become a good learner (boosting your morale!) and a fundamental explanation of our neurological processes. Barbara Oakley is a pleasure to listen to! Thanks!
PS. Just a small criticism to improve: 1) tests little challenging 2) optional interviews are nice but usually generalistic despite being so long
"
2017-05-27 00:00:00,Barbara H,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course. The instructors were so encouraging and positive about what they taught. Thye gave great information but it did not come across as ""lecturing."" By giving examples from their own lives it made the lessons so much more meaningful and also gave me ways to remember some of the learning lessons shared. I wish I had this course many years ago it would have saved me so much time. I eventually self learned some of the information shared here. Hearing it now was so validating and empowering. Thank you!"
2017-04-04 00:00:00,Daniel A R,5.0,0.0,"This is an essential course to understand a bit clearer how to learn new concepts and more important, how our brain works and how we can maximize its performance.



Both Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski master all the subjects taught, and it's remarkable the passion they show in the different videos and the useful optional interviews.



I can only highly recommend this video to those who want to improve their capabilities regarding memory, thinking or best understanding and brain performance in general."
2015-09-17 00:00:00,David F,5.0,0.0,"
Great and simple-to-follow course. It teaches you very useful techniques to improve your learning and tackle procrastination, with day-to-day examples and metaphors. Even though part of the course is presented in a simple and intuitive language, some lectures will go deeper in psychological and neuro-scientific explanations to  let you better understand how the brain works regarding learning.  A must do course for every passionate learner who's willing to optimize his time and effort when approaching new concepts."
2022-08-20 00:00:00,OSAMA D,5.0,0.0,"I​t is very helpful topics discussed and lots of new information and new areas of knoweledge. I believe it should be introducred earlier to adults or students as It will be so beneficial to their study for sure as will as old people like me. This topic deserve more deeper learning as it is very vital to gain more knowledge in shorter time and maximizing the value of valuable resource - Time.
T​hanks for the tremendous time and effort spent in this material, interview, and other available sources for extra readings"
2020-01-28 00:00:00,Hope F,5.0,0.0,"This class will help you think about learning in new ways because (1) it includes recent findings on brain structure and processes (2) it provides concrete tactics for learning more effectively and (3) the teacher grappled with having to rewire her own brain early in career. So, she serves as both proof of the power of the process - and inspiration. She is just so darn NICE. She really wants people to take control of their learning and their lives.  By the time the course is over, you just want to make her proud."
2016-09-19 00:00:00,Yuki I,5.0,0.0,"I knew that this course was one of the most popular courses in personal development genre but the course surpassed my expectations. I began to think learning as a fundamental activity in my daily life rather than simple techniques when facing exams and tough subjects. There are many books on study methods and how to learn effectively but so far, the lecturer is the only one who was successful in connecting the daily life with learning. I believe my notes that I took over the course will be valuable for some time. "
2022-08-02 00:00:00,Gabriel S,5.0,0.0,"Helps a lot to understand how to learn, how our brain and memory works. 
At school we were teach to put a knowlege ""with a hammer"", forced ourselv reriding meterial again, and again, and again. 
Sometimes less is better - more getting away to get new perspective, give brain time to create chunks, to understand all connections better. And practice! Ehen we get some basic idea only practice can do us better. 

If you learning anything (and you should to, believe, it satisfaing!), try this course. You will not regret!a"
2015-09-09 00:00:00,Natia A,5.0,0.0,"Fantastic course. One should make it mandatory to all university professors and would be great for high students and first year university students. I am planning on integrating it into my teaching and presenting some of the ideas and techniques discussed in the course to my students on each class. 
I have tried a few other courses on Coursera and this course seems truly exceptional: the way the material is structured, presented and you can really feel the enthusiasm of the course instructor. 
Thank you very much. "
2021-01-15 00:00:00,Rula Z,5.0,0.0,"As a lifelong learner I found this course invaluable in reaffirming techniques I already employ but also clarifying the science behind how & why we learn. It provides innumerable new insights & techniques to learn more effectively. 
Professor Barbara Oakley is a gem of a Professor and she truly practices what she preaches from the way the material is presented to how we are tested on it. 
This was my 1st course here and my plan is that it will pave the way for a binge festival of all the others via Coursera Plus!"
2020-01-30 00:00:00,Dronile H,5.0,0.0,"Great course! There's so much in here that can help college students, professionals, or lifelong learners on how to better themselves and grasp new concepts or ideas. I'm excited to apply this to future courses on writing, social media, and health. I especially appreciated hearing about the best ways to study and the best ways to retain information -- I've always heard that 10,000 hours of practice was important but this course really laid out why! And gave helpful tips + strategies on how to master a subject."
2019-03-16 00:00:00,Sayanee B,5.0,0.0,"This course includes many practical tips that are backed by research especially in psychology and neuroscience. I have found the concepts of diffused mode of thinking, illusion of competition, working memory, chunking, Pomodoro, spaced repetition, habit steps, hard start, exercise, social sharing and a good night of sleep very helpful. I'm not a student anymore, but as an engineer in the world of fast-paced technology, I'm confident these concepts will help me keep abreast with new ways of thinking and skills."
2018-02-15 00:00:00,Mark J,5.0,0.0,"Lots of nuggets of good information backed with practical advice about how to implement them to your benefit. The explanations of the learning process also help you understand what you (perhaps) are going through currently in coursework, or in your professional life
Honestly, these teachings should be brought up early in someone's academic career, and most beneficially when someone has taken on an independent learning mindset for maximum effect. Since you're on Coursera, that's probably you, so take this class! "
2017-07-12 00:00:00,Jiacheng J,5.0,0.0,"Very helpful. I'd been thinking of myself as a quick learner for years and found it a mere illusion during this course. It points out that my over-learning in a specific area fooled me and hence myself stuck somewhere. The question 'why am i not making any progress along the career path even if I'm learning quickly' now never frustrates me.
This course has more than just pointing out this illusion. Invaluable advice of learning will obviously help me for the rest of my life, at least 40 years as I'm expecting:P"
2016-02-02 00:00:00,Ravi K K,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course, 2016 is going to be a very challenging year form me as I have
to perform in new role in my job. And I have enrolled in a one full year
course.  As I have limited time, I need use my time effectively with
better learning techniques. 100% satisfied, I will highly recommend this course to every one as learning is
every day job.
 
Now I am doing physical exercise every day, preparing task
lists and more importantly I am using spaced recitation.
 
Thanks to trainers and the Coursera team. Great job!!!"
2015-12-24 00:00:00,Gursharan B,5.0,0.0,"
First course on Coursera I completed all the way. Excellent instructors and very valuable advice. Anyone can benefit from this course, no matter their age, profession, or interests.
Learning about how your mind works was the most valuable thing I gained from this course. It added meaning and context to all the learning techniques that were explained, so that everything made sense. This is also a very well researched course.  All the information presented is backed up by numerous references to scientific papers."
2021-03-13 00:00:00,cornelius c,5.0,0.0,"  This course is really amazing. Even though I haven't implemented all the tips. I will try to do it. The course told me a lot of interesting tips and some of them maybe I've implemented in the past and it worked, but I haven't realized that it is amazing and I should do that again. The teacher Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski nailed the way they present the materials so that even after some weeks of skipping the courses, I can still recall the materials. This is one of the best courses i ever learned.  "

There's also a lot of great additional information like interviews, articles, books, etc. I've found a lot of new information about learning and I've started to use that information. I feel more confident now and I've started to enjoy the process of learning in a new way. And I've already recommended this course to some of my friends and colleagues!
All in all, it's the best course I've ever been enrolled to!"

C'est un cours que j'ai pu suivre à mon rythme c'est à dire celui de mon environnement (mon travail, ma famille et ma vie personnelle) j'ai apprécié la progression globale, la diversité des sujets qui tourne autour de l'apprentissage et aussi l'empathie que les professeurs dégagent à leurs étudiants. J'ai eu l'impression de faire partie d'une équipe.

2020-05-13 00:00:00,Syed M D S A,5.0,0.0,"This was truly a learning ride. I got to experience many different ways to improve my learning. Not only that, but the course also helped me point out why some of the learning techniques that I have been using don't work(Excessive highlighting is one of them). Besides the regular course material, the optional interviews were revelational. Inspired by Benny Lewis, I have started to learn Spanish. I want to thank the instructors and the people who helped create this brilliant course. Kudos for a job well done. "
2019-11-27 00:00:00,Tien D,5.0,0.0,"Terrific! THANK YOU! Awesome! This excellent course outlines from A to Z all you wish you had known about learning before going to school. I really appreciate the vast body of knowledge presented in the course: neuroscience, science, art, psychology, philosophy, writing, humanitarian.

Besides, it was very useful for me to tackle some learning problems I had, like procrastination or reading problems. It also provides good tips on how to manage your stress before taking a test and on how to improve your learning, all from a scientific basis! I like a lot the lectures of Dr. Barbs Oakley, she is a very good professor. I enjoyed a lot listening to her videos. Thank you team for this good course! Happy Learning! "

I learned new way's of thinking, and learned about focus and diffused modes. I could go on. Taking this course will help me in my college classes and it will also help decrease my anxiety about taking tests, procrastinating and studying. I also feel confident that I will have success in college if I apply what I've learned from this course. Thank you very much for offering this class!

2021-06-09 00:00:00,Sanjay G,5.0,0.0,This course was really helpful to make me understand about the concepts of How actually learning process work on and how we can able to understand any difficult subject in easy way.  This course really helped me to understand what mistakes i have been doing in my past and how i could make it correct and better. It showed that how i can maintain the flow of learning all along my life. It is one of the best courses i have and teachers were best to explain. I am very satisfied with this course and its content.
2020-12-03 00:00:00,Amalia D,5.0,0.0,"Learning How to Learn has been a great learning experience. Although the course has been released several years ago and so, many of the techniques described were not entirely unknown to the learner of 2020, it remained to be interesting and pleasant throughout these four weeks. It can easily be perceived as an easy course. In my opinion, this is a big victory of Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski being extraordinary professors, fun and educational at the same time. It has been a great experience. Thank you!"
2020-05-10 00:00:00,Jonathan S,5.0,0.0,"The takeaways from this course are of practical benefit to learning and mastering a subject. Be it a technical or a creative. As the title suggests, it is a vital prerequisite to any subject you wish to study. A consequence of completed this course is a complete review of the choices I have been making on a day to day level regarding learning. It is time to switch out the bad habits and install the new ones that I have both learned and been convinced of on this course. It might just change your outlook too. "
2017-10-22 00:00:00,Artem K,5.0,0.0,I think anyone would benefit from the course *as a place to start* because it provides a great quick overview of available tools and strategies. I wish there was a part to the course which puts all this strategies into practice by really driving the point home that this or that particular technique really works. It would be easy for example to to have people memorize a 20 item grocery list using Memory Palace or delight students with fun and clever metaphors to teach a rather complicated scientific concept. 
2020-10-26 00:00:00,Jinan M L,5.0,0.0,"Concise lessons, easy quizzes, cute analogies and superb additional material make this course an obvious choice for learners of all ages. I saw a significant improvement in my studying efficiency after just the first week! And a tip - do watch the optional interviews and check out the supplementary reading, I learned a TON from those as well! Whether you are completely inexperienced or have already explored the science of learning, this course will have something new to teach you. What are you waiting for?"
2020-07-08 00:00:00,Debanshu S,5.0,0.0,"  I rate this course a BILLION STAR. This is by far one of the best and most brilliant course i have taken with an life changing impact. lately i being a senior Technical professional was struggling with procrastination, Illusion of incompetence, Einstellung and almost all negative symptoms discussed in this course. [Yes,I learned all the above terminology from this course] . With the mitigation techniques shared,i am resolute to change my life.Lots of Love and Respect for you Prof. Barbara and Prof. Terry .  "
2020-05-09 00:00:00,Nicole W,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed this course enormously. It made me rethink many fallacies about learning that I have believed. I feel inspired to not only improve my understanding of my current chosen field, but to branch out into other disciplines in order to expand the way in which my brain can creatively solve problems. I wish that I had this course as a resource when I was still in high school. But here we are, 30 years old and ready to get my learn on in a far more meaningful way than I had previously thought was possible."
2021-01-16 00:00:00,Richmond A,5.0,0.0,"This course is very informative, It really helped me understood the many strategies to use in learning and also realizing that repeating something to one's self many times for a long period of time isn't the best ideal of learning. Instead space the repetition out.  I also learned about the focus mode of learning and how to switch into the diffuse mode when necessary. This are all information i got for free that i never knew of until i leant learning how to learn. Thank you to the team behind this course."
2020-06-07 00:00:00,Feras Y I,5.0,0.0,"one of the best courses, and those where I retained a lot of the information. A lot of relevance to so many aspects of life, not only learning. The teaching methods are great, including the sequence, the illustrations, and the exams. I finished it, including the extra -tasks within 12 days, but I had some spare time to use.Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski are great teachers who delivered it in an eye opening way that will affect my approach to many things in life, most importantly, how I guide my kids to learn!"

I, wholeheartedly, place on record my sincere gratitude to both the faculty members for providing an enriched learning experience! "
2018-10-14 00:00:00,Peter H,5.0,0.0,"This is an engaging and entertaining presentation of current research concerning learning that offers practical tools for every learner.  The ""bonus"" videos are fascinating interviews, right to the last one, and the ""honours"" assignments are excellent opportunities to test and demonstrate one's mastery of the subject.

2017-11-05 00:00:00,Coen V,5.0,0.0,I really enjoyed this course! Dr. Oakley has such a great way of explaining concepts and it was such a pleasure taking this class. I learned so much about how to learn and a lot of it was completely new to me. I have started to implement what I've learned and it has already drastically changed the quality of my learning. I especially love the Memory Palace technique and I still remember lists I memorized weeks ago! That is just phenomenal. Thank you for such an awesome class! I recommend this to everyone.
2016-11-07 00:00:00,Anand G,5.0,0.0,This is the best course which helps to understand how you can learn in better way. How you can manage stress. This is great course for anyone regardless of age and what subject anyone want to learn. I would suggest this course should be mandatory before taking any new skill course as it will give you confidence as well as technique using which you can learn the material quickly as well as master the subject in no time. Thank you very much Dr. Barbara Oakley. Appreciate your effort to build up this course.
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Anita K,5.0,0.0,"As an educator, I am glad that I took up this well -structured Modules. Thanks to amazing and in-depth work done by the team. Barbara Oakley has a natural flair and explained very well, easy to follow her well though out interviews with some amazing intellectuals will remain with me as inspiration. I am also in awe of Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and his explanation about the working of a complex machine called the brain. Thanks to the well-developed course it has added value to my learning and worth the time."
2020-05-26 00:00:00,Alejandro G Z,5.0,0.0,"In a very calm, clear and warm way, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski give a very helpful and practical insight into how our brain learns and many techniques and tricks to tackle the many problems (both external and internal) one can face during the learning process, whatever complexity of the subject at hand.
I have personally and immediately benefited of what I learned in this course and I highly recommend it to anyone strugling with the learning process, whatever the age or the academic experience. Thanks!!"
2020-04-18 00:00:00,Rakshith P,5.0,0.0,"When I started this course, I wasn't expecting something that I didn't already know. I have watched several YouTube videos on how to learn and understand better, along with a lot of articles on this topic, but as I progressed along the course, I was surprised at how much I DIDN'T know about the right way to learn. I'm glad I chose this course and it's a course I'll definitely recommend to my friends!
I loved the optional videos and I suggest everyone taking this course to not miss those! Happy Learning :D"
2020-09-22 00:00:00,Diego I A T,5.0,0.0,"The videos are really well structured, they catch your attention and proceed to explain the concept of it. The quiz at the end of them gives a perfect chance to recall the topic reviewed, and they are not hard quizes, sometime they are funny to answer!
And although the weekly test may seem a little sraight forward, you make sure you've learned all the logic in the explanations.
Really good course, my thanks (and congrats) to both Instructors on the efford putted on it, had a really good time finishing it."
2019-07-21 00:00:00,Phatchari O,5.0,0.0,"I wish I knew this course before I started my high school or freshmen in the university year so I could build my knowledge and ability to learn more and not just learned to pass tests.  This should be a curriculum as fundamental for students to learn the fact that they can do everything. Tips and techniques such as Pomodoro, how to access your diffuse mode, how important of sleeping, use metaphor or analogy, change your thoughts / shifting your thinking, a test checklist,  and hard start - jump to easy, "
2017-09-09 00:00:00,杨达,5.0,0.0,"Very Good Course!
The feeling of this course is like a punch in the face. The image of this course in my head is two gurus in learning saying ""Boy, learn in this way"" with a smile and pointing to a mysterious and exciting trod.
I've failed several tests after entering university. Feeling desperate this summer holiday. I began to realize the problem was my learning attitude and methods. By learning this course and applying it in studying ,I feel more confident when take a test or doing study for a project."

I am excited to go back to college and use the tools I've learned in courses and life in general. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone looking to become a better, more engaged learner. Excellent all the way through and it was neat how they used their own findings and implemented them into the course structure. It really helped cement the ideas in my brain for future use while proving their effectiveness."
2019-09-25 00:00:00,Jacqueline B,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course so much.  I found it to be highly valuable in so many aspects.  It is a wealth of information & brings context to the information provided.  I understood many topics from previous areas in my life or areas or study, but I loved how much recall that was impressed upon me throughout the course.  I am absolutely going to be looking into the recommended books and I really enjoyed the optional videos, interviews, and readings. Thank you so much to everyone involved in making this happen."
2018-09-08 00:00:00,Aliaksandr B,5.0,0.0,"Good course!
Quite easy to get into as most of the concepts described are common for everybody, so you can easily map it to your own struggles with learning.
Systematised pieces of knowledge about how our brain works in the context of studying new things. Nice section of optional interviews with a handful advices.
As I got it latter it is based on ""A Mind of Numbers"" book by Barbara Oakley, which has most and even more material, so I would highly recommend that book reading as part of the course syllabus.

After being a professional for ~10 years and getting the feeling that I was getting stuck, I took this course cause it seemed the perfect place to restart learning. It totally did. 
I now have a good understanding on how we learn and will use the techniques from this course not only to continue to learn, but to do job related tasks."

Aussi, j'ai trouvé la présentation de Pr. Barbara Ockley magnifiquement orientée sur les différents aspects de comment apprendre à apprendre ou réapprendre à  comment apprendre.

2020-04-21 00:00:00,KEVIN P,5.0,0.0,"I used this as a review of learning techniques after a few years of being away from school. Although a few topics are geared towards students with text, exams, and study groups, I think this was a great resource to help chart my solo course into learning skills for my new career. This course should be taught in elementary school when students first have to study and take tests and then repeated through life as a refresher and as our understanding of our brains advances. 
Thank you for making this free. "
2017-01-08 00:00:00,Rambo L,5.0,0.0,"Great course. Too bad only a few could see its true value. As normal human being, we have learned a heck lot subjects in our lives before, but only a few have to come to a realization that 'learning' itself is a subject worth studying. Learning something new is not just a requirement to get a job, it's also a core function of being human. And if you do it right, you will have tremendous and life-lasting fun!
 Gratitude for Barb, Terry and Coursera team, for making this happen. You've done a superb job! "

Incorporei essas práticas no meu cotidiano. A percepção em termos de rendimento e fixação de conteúdos é fantástica. Estou muito satisfeito por ter feito esse curso, pena desconhecer essas estratégias e metodologias antes... minha experiência acadêmica teria sido muito melhor. 
De qualquer forma, sou muito grato à Bárbara por compartilhar seus conhecimentos.

2021-03-27 00:00:00,Avirup C,5.0,0.0,Truly grateful to Dr. Barb Oakley and to Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for creating this course with the Coursera Team. The saddening fact is that in schools and colleges different subjects are taught but it is very rarely seen that anyone teaches on how to learn and its one of the most important skill for 21st Century. This course is going to solve that problem and help people to pick up the skill of learning. Just loved the course and possibly would apply the teachings of the course everywhere. Thank You.
2020-06-25 00:00:00,Sara A,5.0,0.0,"  It is a very helpful course which in my opinion all people should take, even if you're in your 60s and finished college and took all the degrees you wanted 40 years ago. We keep learning all our lives till we die. It's amazing how many techniques I've learned from this course in studying and remembering things even remembering things in every day life. I've already used some techniques to tackle my procrastination and looking forward to use the remaining techniques and tricks in my studying and life.  "
2019-07-08 00:00:00,Jesús V,5.0,0.0,"Barbara and Terrence are the kind of teacher one misses from school in the best possible way.
The matter is easy to grasp but not to teach, and they're able to communicate every lesson as if it was obvious in the most natural way.
I don't really understand how this course might be free. It's changing my life and helping me with my procrastination better than any other thing I tried. The companion book is a memento to keep and review, as some of the videos and interviews.
Thanks Barbara, thanks Terrence."

2015-08-17 00:00:00,Vania G,5.0,0.0,"Powerful. This course opened my eyes to somethings that were maybe obvious, but whose deep and real meaning I never rationalized before.
This course is taking method to studying, and supporting said method by science. The instructors are pleasantly easy to follow. They make the subject accessible to all students, even to those for whom English is not the first language, and content is just the second obstacle to overcome.
You have procrastination, math/science learning issues? This is just your course!"
2021-08-30 00:00:00,Jacqueline Z,5.0,0.0,"Bewertung für deutschsprachige Interessierte: Erst hatte ich Bedenken, ob ich in englischer Sprache dem Inhalt des Kurses folgen könnte. Jedoch war dies überraschend einfach, denn die Videos bieten einen Untertitel in Englisch oder auch Deutsch an (und viele weitere Sprachen), sowie das Gesprochene in Form eines Textes, der auch übersetzt werden kann.

Inhalt: Top, einfache und praxisnahe Erklärungen, guter Medieneinsatz, kurzweilige Videoeinheiten, tolle Markier- und Notizfunktion.

Empfehlenswert!

2021-01-29 00:00:00,Amanda W,5.0,0.0,I took this course this past summer and learned a lot.  The Pomodoro Technique has been a game changer in several situations from packing for a move to dealing with the roadblocks surrounding completing undesirable chores around the house or procrastination in completing homework assignments.  The course gave me the idea that maybe I was smart enough to go back to school and attempt to earn a master's degree.  I am currently enrolled in my first semester of graduate school as a result of the course.  
2020-06-17 00:00:00,Varsha A,5.0,0.0,Though this course was meant for students who prepare for exams and tests but I love learning new things so I took up this course. My main problem is procrastination. I am almost 50 yrs old now and I am happy to realize that by understanding the real logic behind procrastination I could work on cues and beliefs. This course has also helped me in guiding students who think they can not learn a particular subject. Interview videos are inspiring. Cheers for Dr.Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski!
2020-05-13 00:00:00,Deleted A,5.0,0.0,"Course highly recomendable. Isn't just a course for learn a couple study-techniques but a great explanation of how your brain works in learning any topic. The material in this course will help you to create your own ""toolkit"" of learning techniques. My best parts were how to deal with Procrastination and the biological factors of learning.
Look at the optional videos, since they invited various high-perfomers that complement with practical advice what you'll learn a long the course.
Happy learning : )"
2018-06-30 00:00:00,Michael J S J,5.0,0.0,"This was the first Coursera class that I've ever taken, and I can say with complete honesty that I was thoroughly impressed with the content. I've learned so much, and can not wait to apply these new skills and strategies. Dr. Oakley is an excellent instructor, and her patient, calm demeanor made the videos a joy to watch. I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone - no matter your background, skill level, or motivations - take a few weeks to complete ""Learning How to Learn."" It will change your life."
2022-02-08 00:00:00,kim w,5.0,0.0,"Really enjoyed this course.  Super helpful material that I found useful for COVID brain fog - some great reminders along with context on how the brain engages to learn. Interestingly our neurons grow through engagement with others and exercise, something that seems to have been lessened during the pandemic. Many helpful tips for all types of learning. Videos in course and optional material have positive stories of how individuals have mastered new material, memory and success. Worth the time spent.

If you are stuck at any age (and I mean it. It doesn't matter if you are 8 or 80) or feel stagnant in your learning endeavors then take this course. You will have a great time with the instructors. Best of all if you have lots of free time and are scared of taking tests then this course will surely help you through. Or if you cannot comprehend the lessons in class this course will help you understand how you can improve.

Take this course at any stage of your life. Happy learning until we meet again."

This course is extremely easy to take, but also incredibly useful in presenting new study techniques, and reinforcing old ones. Although I highly recommend this course for younger learners, the material covered in this course would be beneficial to anyone at any stage. "
2015-12-26 00:00:00,Tom B,5.0,0.0,"I have two degrees and have taken several online courses and been a full-time life-long learner. This is one of the best courses I've ever taken. It seems somewhat new in format, more focused on actual learning than any notion of grades, and by the end, thanks to the wonders of the Internet interface, there was a new, or rather several new features in my inner life that I had more or less painlessly learned. I've recommended this to many people, my children have done it; your course is a true gift."

It’s all distilled from the latest neurological research as is demonstrated by the extensive further reading and reference lists. I wish I’d had the benefit of this course when I was a younger student at university. I especially liked the material about how to overcome procrastination and illusions of competence. I’ve now adopted lots of the methods and practises into my daily and weekly routines."
2019-11-29 00:00:00,Yue L,5.0,0.0,Thank you for teaching this critical course. It helps me better understand scientifically from neuro perspective how our brain functions and reacts.

Но я абсолютно уверена, что полученные знания я буду использовать (и уже использую) в самообучении и обучении в других сферах. Обязательно поделюсь этим курсом с младшими ребятами, чтобы они начали использовать эту информацию в своем обучении уже сейчас (в школе, университете). Желаю успехов в вашем деле!

After I know how my brain works, I learn more efficiently than before without sacrificing the time for rest and sleep. I recommended this course to many of my friends and I recommend it here to people who don't want to give up learning - if you are considering about other courses on coursera and don't know if you can complete them, try this course first. It can be a good one to start and it will help you with others."

Professor Barbara Oakley and Professor Dr. Terrence Sejnowski explain in an intelligible way for the average audience with simple and applicable techniques, classes so captivating that it made me want the course to be even bigger.

It is simple, not boring, funny, and of course easy to understand. Good job."
2018-02-09 00:00:00,Amol G,5.0,0.0,"As mentioned, this course is all about learning what we already learnt. Probably, our parents or seniors or elder had already told us to do. Somethings adopted and somethings not. However this course teaches the principles behind what they taught to us. After knowing the principles and science behind the teaching, the teaching becomes all very authentic and somewhere integrates all the memory chunks.  While the study material was scientific however good care was taken to present it in simple way."

Your crisp presentation and pace of delivery should be emulated by anyone who intends to teach online. Love you and hope to have more courses from you shortly. "
2020-05-28 00:00:00,Shahab Y,5.0,0.0,An excellent course that everyone can benefit from. We are all always learning new things in life. The technics covered in 'Learning How to Learn' course on Coursera by Drs. Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski can help anyone improve the way they grasp new information and commit it to memory. I personally enjoyed taking this course and it has had an immense impact on my own learning already and I can't even begin to imagine how much it will accelerate my learning in the future in any other space.
2020-04-25 00:00:00,D C,5.0,0.0,"I found this course extremely informative.  I really enjoyed Barbara's slides as they were particularly easy to understand and follow.  I found that the other Professor relied too heavily on the notes he was reading, avoided eye-contact in parts, and didn't have the flow of Barbara.  Obviously an extremely clever gentleman however I thought it was worth mentioning.  Really pleased to be able to take such a quality course for free so a big thanks goes to Coursera but more so, McMaster University."

It also helped me to calm down about that I'm not the only one with some of the problems mentioned in the course. What I also found interesting where the examples of the people true history and who overcame their problems this was very inspiring. thank you very much ! Hans Van der Veken (Belgium)"
2016-05-21 00:00:00,Darlene R,5.0,0.0,"The course was well paced and structured, allowing anyone, even someone quite busy with other distractions, to manage.  There is a wealth of material to focus on, but as the course points out, it is the time you ""meditate, sleep and exercise"" around what you are learning that allows your defused thinking to store the gems of information away to be used for a lifetime.  Great resources too, and both Terry and Barbara were quietly advocates for never being careless about learning.  Thank you both.  "
2020-08-10 00:00:00,Cey Y,5.0,0.0,"Good course. I definitely feel as if I've improved my learning skills. I wish I'd had a course like this when I was at school - I'm sure I would have done much better (I wasn't too bad, but I wasn't the best either). I think it's also useful for older people like me (40+) because I can still apply this to lots of areas of life and, as the course explains, we can carry on learning throughout life so there's every reason to do this. I might use the information I've learned here to change careers. "
2020-05-04 00:00:00,Anastasia,5.0,0.0,"I wish I knew this way back when I was studying at the university. Fantastic course, explaining very important things about how human brain works in a series of small, comprehensive videos. I would recommend it to anyone who considers learning something new. I have also really appreciated the supportive mood of this course and general approach that learning is for everyone and even if you are terrible at, e.g. math, it is a matter of time and your own effort to succeed in learning this subject."

This course has shown me behind the curtains of how our brain works, especially when it comes to learning new things.
It has imparted with research proven techniques on how I can learn more effectively and has made learning new things a fun challenge to me.
I especially loved to pomodoro technique on how to beat procrastination.
Dr. Barbara Oakley really outdid herself with her fun anecdotes and the way she explained things with such simplicity.
This MOOC could not have been constructed more aptly. "

2017-07-02 00:00:00,Yuri C,5.0,0.0,"Very good overview on learning ""how to learn"". Having already read ""A mind for numbers"" (AMFN) from the same author (Oakley), I can say that -to me at least- this was a good recap of the material already ""chucked"" from the book. Most of the extras in each course's week (different from the book) are interesting and well-thought. I recommend to read AMFN to those who have liked this course, because it goes more in-depth on some topics, but this course is definitely worth it even without the book."
2016-01-20 00:00:00,Maria B,5.0,0.0,The most useful course I've ever taken! It explained  how brain works when you try to learn something in a very practical and easy way. The course gives useful tools and techniques how to overcome procrastination and overlearning. It destroys the belief that some people are good for science only and some are only for humanitarian areas. You really can do everything with the right approach and deliberate practice. Thank you Barbara and the course team for sharing your personal inspiring stories.

I think everyone should have those tools as early as possible. The only thing related to this course that I need to stress out is the fact that it would make my life easier if I would have finished it before my studies. Everyone who appreciates curiosity and learning, especially if one has some struggles with it, has my recommendation to enrol."
2020-11-30 00:00:00,Aze A,5.0,0.0,This  course has a very friendly outline.

What I really liked about this course was the pop up prompts with questions related to the topic explained. I recommend it to everybody who wants to improve her/his learning experience in any area on a day today basis. The tasks help to consolidate what was taught all along course. A very well structure course!
2020-07-29 00:00:00,MarkAnthony K,5.0,0.0,"The techniques learned in this course can really be used, not only for learning something new but in many other areas of my life.  I acquired practical advice that was easy to remember and not so ""far out"" that I found it hard to believe they'd work.  And I enjoy Barbara's style of teaching-I found it calming and easily understood.  I would recognize this course to students of all ages.  You are never too old to learn new things.  I learned some things I've never tried and I am 53 years young."
2019-03-05 00:00:00,Eman A,5.0,0.0,"  A very useful course covering concepts behind how to learn effectively and efficently. Barbara Oakley is a warm and friendly presenter whose videos make a potentially dull subject fun and enjoyable (with the use of zombies, flying mules, etc). Terrence Sejnowski tends to do one main video a week, detailing more anatomical/medical aspects. I'd recommend it to anyone who is about to undertake some serious studying as it covers techniques such as overcoming procrastination and learning fallacies.   "
2017-10-24 00:00:00,Kevin M K M,5.0,0.0,"A big thank you to the course instructors Terrence and Barbara, a very informative MOOC on how the brain works and how we can apply ourselves in mastering any subject we are interested in. This course has practical tools and techniques to get you started in the journey of learning. I high recommend to anyone who is struggling to grasp new concepts, getting back to school after a while, career change or already in school. And lastly if you are a teacher, you definitely have to take this course!"
2022-08-13 00:00:00,David B (,5.0,0.0,"Ideal course for people starting the first semester of university bachelor, or even a master’s. Great course for those who hate subjects usually considered hard, like maths and science. It will help you learn anything you want though. It will give you plenty of valuable techniques that are research-based, and that will enhance your learning. It teaches you that learning is not about punishments but more about rewards, habits, and knowing how to use habits to save valuable cognitive resources."
2021-07-27 00:00:00,Jeremiah G,5.0,0.0,"This is the most comprehensive and compact course on self-studying techniques I've had the pleasure of completing. Even though I decided not to get a certificate (which can be paid for), the fact that it's free gives everyone the opportunity to jump start self-learning. It's for beginners, experts, young, and old alike. Everyone should take this during or after graduating school. It's essential for upgrading your current skillset and not plateau intellectually. I highly recommend this course!

There is almost no redundancy in the materials presented in this course. I was a person who struggled years and years to study and work efficiently during the day. This course is a game/life-changer for me. Im not exaggerating at all. I am now doing almost 3 times more than i did a day, in terms of hours of focused work/study. I cant be grateful enough to creators of this course."
2019-04-08 00:00:00,Aaron F,5.0,0.0,  This course reinvigorated a belief that I can learn and retain information useful to my life. I have been out of school for about 7 years and was anxious to go back or do studying of any kind. I happened upon this course through an article of self improvement and it was a fantastic find. It helped me understand some of my self defeating beliefs related to learning and how to move forward with useful study and retention techniques.

The techniques mentioned in this course are scientifically backed and have helped me with my focus. One take away that I highly recommend everyone should try is the Pomodoro Technique i.e. Learn with complete focus for 25 minutes, then reward yourself with a break of 5-10 minutes allowing your brain to do it's job of (unintentionally) recalling things you've learnt in the topic you are learning. "
2017-12-21 00:00:00,Odysseas C,5.0,0.0,"  A must for every student, working man or woman out there. The course depicts the biological concepts behind learning and the necessary psychological elements that everyone must know to become better at it. It's a course that should be taught in every university as the first class when you enter it. Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski will take you on a beautiful journey that will make you understand better your brain, mind and make you fall in love with learning. Thank you for this awesome course!  "
2016-11-27 00:00:00,Inna F,5.0,0.0,"I think that this course is really fundamental and it is necessary to learn best practices how to learn new material and how to broad our passion and other interest. I think this it is amazing course, but English is not my native language and for me it is a good idea to start this course again and to repeat it. Also I was not very active and didn't collaborate with other students, so I think it is necessary also to fix this part :)
I also very appreciated the Tutors and enjoy their speeches.  "
2015-08-25 00:00:00,Jessica C M,5.0,0.0,"I haven't finished the course yet, but I liked it so much that I convinced my husband and my mom to enroll in it as well. The content of this course is so important that I honestly think it should be a mandatory class for everyone who is genuinely interested in learning, which could be a teenager on High School or an adult starting college. Finding this course feels like finding a treasure, thanks for creating such an amazing course and making it available on Coursera to the general public!"
2021-06-01 00:00:00,Bernice N,5.0,0.0,"This was a wonderful course. It opened my eyes to different ways of learning and the need to unlearn some things. And also how the mind and memory works. People think that as you get older, you are no longer able to learn. But, you just need to train yourself to be a better learner and keep yourself motivated to do so. I will continue to be a life learner for self improvement and hopefully be able to help and motivate others in their learning journey. The instructors were great. Thank you!"
2020-12-25 00:00:00,Moysidis P,5.0,0.0,"The content of the course is very useful and the instructors are very knowledgeable about the process of learning. The examples provided by they instructors are very creative, following the practices they also teach in this course. The course manages to explain in depth how the brain works and how we can use that knowledge to improve our learning processes. The knowledge provided by this course can be used any possible field that you are working or studying or trying to improve in general."
2020-08-25 00:00:00,Dan N,5.0,0.0,"Simply put, this course should be taught in schools. The insights I have gained into how we learn have been astounding. The videos are enaging and fun, all thanks to Barb and Terry's endearing nature. I liked that the science behind why these methods work are explained rather than brushed over or dumbed down like I have seen in other courses.
I am yet to find the degree or subject I would like to master but I do know the techniques taught in this course will play a big part in achieving it."
2019-06-06 00:00:00,vignaux,5.0,0.0,"Ce cours est vraiment passionnant. Il m'a permis de mieux comprendre comment mieux utiliser ma façon d'apprendre. Nous utilisons tous des techniques plus ou moins efficaces.Grâce à ce cours de très bon conseils et des exemples sont proposés. Super et inévitable.
This course is really exciting. It allowed me to better understand how to better use my way of learning. We all use more or less effective techniques. Thanks to this course very good advice and examples are offered. Super and smart…"
2017-07-22 00:00:00,Artūr M,5.0,0.0,"Perfect. Now I know how the brain works. I understand that procrastination is addiction and you just need to put effort into starting doing something. Just go through bad feel in brain like through the brick wall. Time after time it will be easier to start, because brain will remember rewards that await. Also, it's very important to focus on process, not on the final product. Thank you very much for course authors. Also big thanks for creating such a wonderful MOOC system, coursera admins!"
2018-03-19 00:00:00,Marcus H,5.0,0.0,"I can't express how much I enjoyed and resonated with this course. I wish I'd had it several years ago when I returned to school to finish my bachelor's degree. It would have made a huge difference. As it is, I'm confident in newfound abilities to study and absorb new skills and subjects as I move forward as a lifelong learner. Bravo, and thanks to the makers for allowing so many of us to audit the full course. I'll be recommending it to everyone I know who begins an educational endeavor."
2018-03-04 00:00:00,arnuld,5.0,0.0,"If there is only one MOOC you can take, this would be it. It is not a theory class, instructors talk about practical methods and explain the science behind them too. In fact, it is one of the most practical courses I have seen. You can use the techniques in your professional and financial life too. If you are interested  in becoming better at learning things, just go take the course. 
NOTE: Honors section of the course is optional but if you do it, you will learn some really useful things. "
2021-07-30 00:00:00,Katie T,5.0,0.0,"A very useful course no matter what stage you are in life. Especially helpful to younger students to save time in their studies. However, this course is also very helpful to people beyond school in more easily pursuing new interests. For example, I'm trying to pick up new skills in my free time, but often procrastinate or feel daunted at the time it will take to pick up these skills. However, this course has helped me learn how to be more efficient with my time and better improve myself."

В дополнение в нём присутствует много интервью с поистине интересными людьми. Всё это помогает вам стать действительно мастером в обучении. Огромное спасибо авторам за данный курс!"
2020-10-04 00:00:00,PAKHI C,5.0,0.0,"This course helps us to know more about our brain , how our brain gasp the concept that we study and how can we make our brain remember the things more easily.
It speaks about various techniques like memory palace and others which will help you to increase your memory . 
Also by understanding the techniques taught by them and the various facts given by them about our memory and working of brain  we can improve the skill of  how to learn and make our concepts last for long without cramming."
2020-05-18 00:00:00,James W,5.0,0.0,"Loved this course. Its all about the process of learning, rather than the product of learning. The course builds a basic understanding of key principals of neuroscience in order to explain how humans learn, and therefore teaches the pupil how they can more effectively.
Some of the lessons I had heard before, but now I understanding WHY they are so important to apply in learning. Knowing this, I have already changed approaches at work, as well as in my personal learning.
Highly recommended.

This course give you methods of learning how to learn, it doesn't matter the field of study. Provide you a useful technique to overcome procrastination like ""Pomodoro technique"", and also some extra reading material and interviews from interesting people who share they're own tips of learning in order to achieve their goals."
2020-03-24 00:00:00,Bryant B,5.0,0.0,"Great course. I took it in preparation for returning to Uni to get a Computer Science degree. I have Intuitively known I am a much naturally stronger 'creative' person than say a math person, but It was great to dive Into the deeper science behind It and how I can leverage my existing strengths as well as broaden and deepen my current weaknesses In learning particular subjects. Instructor Is pretty great and I recommend for anyone looking to enhance their learning In all aspects of life. "
2016-10-07 00:00:00,My N,5.0,0.0,"This is my first course I took and completed on Coursera. I love how you structure the lectures, enthusiasm in each videos, the learner could interact with videos, take free quizzes. This course opens mind eyes, refresh my mind, and give me a lot of great and useful technique in approaching, learning and understand new difficult concepts. I would love to recommend this course for my friends. Thanks Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team for this great course. "
2016-09-04 00:00:00,G M,5.0,0.0,"This course provides each learner the tool kit to learn subjects that are at times daunting. 
Rather than offering platitudes the suggestions are based on sound research.They  tap the capacities of the brain after understanding how our brains function.
Having that  insight has helped me from getting frustrated when the material is hard to master.
The sections on chunking, memory and procrastination has been of invaluable help.
A deep bow to the creators of the course and to course era.
Thanks
"
2020-12-17 00:00:00,Annabelle M,5.0,0.0,"I completed this course a couple of months ago, and I still bring it up regularly when talking to friends and family. I learned the importance of many concepts, even though I don't put it all into practice (I'm only human). I used the metaphor concept while studying for my genetics final though, and every time I feel like procrastinating I tell myself, ""All you have to do is start!"". I believe that anyone who takes this class will learn at least one new thing, and I highly recommend it! "
2020-08-05 00:00:00,Julio R,5.0,0.0,I  had been wanting to take an online course for a long time. Finally I did it and could not have been more glad that this course was the first one. For me is hard to see value in these free courses but I am very pleased with what I have learned on it. The knowledge acquired on this course can be applied right away on any desired task. It gives you a broad understanding on how our brain works in terms of learning new things. I would highly recommend this course. Health and Peace To All.
2020-05-08 00:00:00,Loredana B,5.0,0.0,"  I have learned so much from this course. Many details that I was not giving much attention to, now I am taking them into consideration. I have learned about memory and it's ways of working. I found out how to properly learn, how not to waste time. I will use as much as I can from this course in my daily life and I really think everyone can benefit from it. It changes your perspective about the process of learning. And, last but not least, it is very interesting and fun at the same time.  "
2020-05-06 00:00:00,Добровольский Д,5.0,0.0,"    A very usefull and easy-going class to improve your overall learning skills. I must admit that being a person that speaks English not as a mother tongue at first had some problems with understanding, but with the help of subtitles it was quiet easy. I am sure that in future using tips, notions and exercises that i dealt with in this class i can really improve my approach in new subjects no matter what they will be. It suits everyone.   Great thanks for people who do such incredible job.  "
2020-04-01 00:00:00,Goutom D,5.0,0.0,"Before doing this course I knew some of the techniques that are mentioned in this course videos but I didn't know the name of the techniques also didn't utilize those techniques on me properly. After finishing I am feeling relaxed and now I can think more clearly about all the techniques I have learned and feel confident. At last, I want to thank Madam Dr. Barbara Oakley, she is a great teacher as well as a humble person who did a lot of hard works to make the course easy to understand.

"
2016-02-19 00:00:00,Christina D,5.0,0.0,"Amazing course! Some statements I knew from time-management (such as making a task list or Pomodoro technique), but now I understand them 'cause in this course these statements were explained through science. And it's very interesting to learn how our brain works.
Also I was very inspired by all people from interviews, it's a very good option in this course.
Great thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for this couse and for making me believe in my strength and potential!"
2021-06-07 00:00:00,Danielle S,5.0,0.0,"This was an excellent course. Each video is short, rarely going beyond 10 minutes, with clear, easy to understand explanations on how the brain works, tips on effective ways to study, as well as ineffective study habits to avoid. There are quizzes to help in retaining and understanding the material, and optional reading and interviews that give further tips beyond the core content. I will be using what I've learned here extensively, and would recommend this course to anyone interested.

2016-07-26 00:00:00,Carolina N C,5.0,0.0,"An amazing course. I wasn't expecting much when I enrolled a few weeks ago but the more I studied and watched the lessons I was surprised with so many great tips and resources to understand and become a better learner. I found it funny that there were some techniques that I already use but have never thought on them. I reccomend this course to anyone, either in high school or college, or even as preparation for other courses in Coursera. Why don't they teach this in elementary schools?

"
2020-10-15 00:00:00,Siddharth S G,5.0,0.0,"This is not a casual course to accomplish rather a boon for those who have a false image for themselves that they cannot be improved. In all my honesty , this course in really a must do for all who want to make themselves better and also for those who want to make themselves the best.
At last , I would truly thanks the whole Coursera community for introducing such courses for us and a big thanks to Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for being such nice and great instructors."
2020-08-17 00:00:00,Kerwin M,5.0,0.0,"This course has been awesome. Since starting this course, i see the practical application in all most every life situation. For example, when i feel overwhelmed by a task, i have learned to take time out from the task at hand and do something totally unrelated then go back the task later, and yes, it does seem to magically appear more doable. i will also break the task up into smaller tasks and that works well. 
This course is great for everyday life!!!!  Thank you, Thank you Thank you"
2020-07-25 00:00:00,Mandar P,5.0,0.0,"It's a really interesting and never thought about kind of learning that I received from this course. In fact i started using the learnings to even continue and complete this course, which I thought would be left in mid way. This is really effective and i would definitely recommend this over spending 20 hours on any netflix best rated series..  its not because Netflix isn't good, but this course is better and its needed for you to stay in the game.. the game of Life.. Happy learning..."
2018-04-14 00:00:00,vishwash v,5.0,0.0,"After taking this class, I realized I wasted my whole life in learning new skills and left out many skills behind believing that I can not learn or I do not have that particular gene or something to learn those new skills. 
Now, after taking this course, I am feeling like- make a list that I ever wanted to learn and start it - And I am pretty much confident now that I will excel. I am more confident than ever.
Thanks to Coursera and Barbara for removing those bad zombies out of my mind."
2017-09-24 00:00:00,Cherry_berry,5.0,0.0,"very helpful to me. It seems I learned for a long time with bad learing habits which did make me hard to reach the targets. I didn't realise that the bad habits and concepts really make my learning ineffective everyday until I took this course. And the skills introduced and experence sharing in the insteresting interviews not only help me how to learn effectively but also let me wanna pick up more subjects which I once gave up. Yes, wanna try the learning skills in the new challenges.  "
2021-07-08 00:00:00,Justin K,5.0,0.0,"The course was very well structured. It was very good for explaining the science behind the various techniques and learning challenges. This allows for a better understanding and context of the reason for the technique working or the origin of the challenge. 
The topics were very engaging and digestible. 
I would recommend this as a compulsory first step for anyone who intends to pursue any type of educational course as a foundational tool to enrich and get a better return on learning. "
2021-03-10 00:00:00,Lai L T,5.0,0.0,"This course helps me understand how brain deals with memory, learning, and procastination.I have realised the methods I was using all these years are not effective enough and too passive. It gives me lots of new ideas how I should adjust my way of learning German and how to make the new knowledge store better. The pomodoro technique, switching between the focused and tight mode and the free and loose mode, is definitely useful for my job which involves lots of writing and creativity. "

2015-11-30 00:00:00,Chinara G,5.0,0.0,"
It gave me a lot of new information about learning and not only. Information about procrastination and pomidorro technique was surprisingly interesting for me. Becase as a big procrastinator I thought that İ was born this way and cannot change anything.
It is interesting to test the technique ""start hard jump easy"", because I always tried to finish easy task first in order to feel myself self confident and to finish as much item as possible quickly leaving  lot of time for hard tasks."
2021-03-05 00:00:00,John,5.0,0.0,"Learning how to learn should be a mandatory subject at school and 
continue throughout college and/or personal life. It's instrumental to

I think every student should take this course. This would help tremendously in the studies/learning progress, as no matter how hard you work, if you work the wrong way then it is a waste of time and effort(and you get minimal result).

The metaphors and analogies used by her in the videos have not only made the entire course light weight yet deep rooted in my memory but also taught me the best way to make slides to keep the viewer glued.
It is such a pleasure to complete the course waiting eagerly for the next videos and now finishing the next course ""Mindset"".

I wish I knew half of the principles and learning facts discussed in this course earlier in my studying journey
but it's never too late"

my problems with learning and deal with them to be more productive.
Every concept was explained in a simple way that every person will understand. I think that every course should be like that.
I advise everyone taking the course to watch the optional interviews. They are very helpful and give us true stories from which we 
can learn a lot."
2016-02-03 00:00:00,Fatemeh K,5.0,0.0,"Through this course, I learned about working and long-term memory mechanisms. 
I find out that my style of studying in 20 years of education (from grade 1 to half of my PhD.) was inappropriate. 
Now, I know about the power of recall, deliberate excercises and of course a full night sleep before an important test. I think if I knew these facts when I was at highschool my life would be different. 
I wish healthy joyful life for prof. Oakly and Senjowsky, as they change rest of my life.

2020-04-26 00:00:00,R E,5.0,0.0,  This is a very interesting course for those who want to get an insight of how some people succeed in bringing the best out of them while many others struggle. The methods and tips discussed in the course are very helpful and easy to apply it in real world problems.The course is made concise and doesn't take up too much of time. 2 hours in a week should be enough to complete the course in 4 weeks. The explanation of topics are also done very well that makes it easy to understand.  
2019-01-14 00:00:00,Zach H,5.0,0.0,"This course does something that I think every education system should use as a hard foundation to their teaching philosophy, it teaches people how to learn effectively and efficiently.  It is incredibly frustrating that in my 18+ years as a student through primary education and on to graduate levels, I was never meaningfully taught how to study for myself but this course has done an outstanding job of doing just that.  This should be required learning for every education system."
2017-01-22 00:00:00,Barbara H,5.0,0.0,"Thanks for giving me the opportunity to rethink parts of my work as teacher. During the sessions of this course I already gave my students some hints, such as ""pomodoro"" (it was the first time I heard about it, although I'm Italian :)). The next step will be encouraging those who struggle with study and giving them some tools. 
Another thing I love is returning to be a student and taking tests: this helps me understanding what's going on in the students mind.

Plenty of relevant info on the brain and body in relation to both learning and well-being, as well as practical study tools and practices. The course also had a great structure; well-built for retention of the material, and applying the principles explained in the course. Really happy with the experience and information provided, and I will make sure to apply the information and learning tools during my pursuit of knowledge :)"
2015-10-14 00:00:00,Vivian M,5.0,0.0,"This is my first course on this site and I really enjoyed it.  The interesting thing is, some of the things the professors spoke about are things I've done before but it wasn't that effective because I did it wrong.  This course simply teaches how to learn effectively but it's up to you to practice what you've been thought. The professors are wonderful and so are the interviews.  Either you are having difficulty studying or you want to improve your studies, this course is great!  "
2022-07-24 00:00:00,Margherita ,5.0,0.0,"This course was amazing. Barbara explains in a very friendly, easy to understand way, making the content more interesting and easy to follow.
As someone who has always procrastinated so much that I could never finish a Coursera course, this was the first one I was able to finish thanks to the many tips they share, and I can see myself using these tips not only in learning but also in real life. It was a real pleasure to follow this journey, thank you for your energy and passion!"
2021-07-08 00:00:00,Pamela L,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course.  I learned very valuable tools to help with my future studies and also in my professional career such as the Pomodoro technique, Chunking and using metaphors and analogies to learn.  Mostly, I learned that I was a poor listener and often went into Zombie mode while learning, or in meetings.  I suffered from Illusions of Competence.  This was huge for me!  I applied the concepts of this class in order to help me develop some solid study habits and it worked!"
2021-03-24 00:00:00,Mimi E M,5.0,0.0,"The explanations are interesting. I like it that there are transcripts to follow as i am a visual learner.. i understand better if i listen and read as well as take down important notes. Prof Barkley sometimes speaks rather softly and i have to put the volume on my laptop to max. Otherwise, everything else is great! i also like the questions asked after most of the videos.. they help me to recall important facts about the videos and test my understanding... Good Job professors!"
2020-06-28 00:00:00,Farhan T K,5.0,0.0,"  This course helped me to realize and pinpoint a lot of the really bad habits that I've always had while learning anything. It has also taught quite a few really nice and effective methods to be able to leave those bad habits as well to learn in the most efficient way, just as the name suggests. I'm thankful to the instructors for this amazing course, and would suggest everyone like me, who has always had problems with performing well even after spending a lot of time preparing.  "
2020-05-04 00:00:00,Amelia O,5.0,0.0,"The course was a joy to take! So many interesting topics, interviews and explanations. Loads of interesting and useful material to learn to approach, examine and study any subject. It clearly opens a path for a better and easier way of learning whatever we want.  Both instructors were kind and generous with their knowledge and way of conducting their classes. Special thanks to Mrs. Barbara Oakley for her kindness and warm way of explaining and teaching all. Such a sweet lady !! "
2016-09-06 00:00:00,Jon F,5.0,0.0,"Fantastic course! Wish I had taken this class and/or read Dr. Oakley's book when I was an undergraduate in college and/or in graduate/B-school. So many wonderful trips and tricks for getting the most out of your education and learning experience. I enrolled in the course to learn new and effective methods for absorbing and applying information more quickly in my professional working life, while also balancing the demands of running a start-up in the evenings.  Five-star course!  "
2021-03-06 00:00:00,Qian Y,5.0,0.0,"This course helps me extremely a lot in not only from the learning aspect, also from the aspect of life and career. To know the focus and the diffuse mode, and how to deal with procrastination are definitely things that start to help my learning much more effective. The fact that even average intelligent people can accomplish extradinary things help me to change my thoughts about those genius people and also motivate me to accomplish something that I do not dare to try before."
2021-01-19 00:00:00,Carlo C,5.0,0.0,"Probably you already know some tools that are explained here, but now you can learn also which ones are the most effective and why, thanks to the neuroscience aspects covered.
It's a revolutionary and complete course on 'Learning about learning'. There are well structured units, each done exhaustively. Lessons are short and make you fix the point, so they are not boring and are perfect for both poor and model students. 
The only requirement, in my opinion, is to want to improve."
2020-11-29 00:00:00,Tharushi L,5.0,0.0,"It was a great course. I enjoyed it a lot. It taught me very useful concepts and tips like how to avoid procrastination, how to learn properly by recalling, repetition, how to prepare for a test by going through a exam checklist, importance of exercise and sleep, how to team work and etc.  not only for near future but for the entire life. Lecturers delivered all very simply making it easier to be learnt.  I recommend this course to anyone with trouble learning and test taking."
2021-03-16 00:00:00,Dennis A B,5.0,0.0,"This course is just wonderful.  It informed and inspired me.  Somethings I knew intuitively some I didn't, but to hear these concepts spoken and illustrated with the care and empathy that Dr. Oakley and the other contributors display, make the lessons all the more understandable and important.  This is a course I think I will come back to often, thru recall (you'll learn about it) and by actually re-watching the videos, because this material is that useful.  Highly recommend."
2020-11-30 00:00:00,María J C,5.0,0.0,"He disfrutado y aprendido como nunca antes!!!. Que mas se puede pedir a un curso. Como con los buenos libros con ""Learning how to learn"" cada día estaba deseando avanzar y conocer nuevas técnicas y habilidades en el aprendizaje. Ha sido emocionante desde el principio hasta el fin. No puedo mas que recomendar este curso y agradecer a Barbara Oakley y a Terry Sejnowski su generosidad por trasmitirnos tan valiosos conocimientos para el aprendizaje y para la viva. Thanks a lot!!!"
2018-02-13 00:00:00,Soh W K,5.0,0.0,"After going through this course, first week only, I realized that this subject itself, should be the first course that any university students or adults or students should go through FIRST, before studying the really tough ones inside Coursera.org.
Basically, it's a course to share tips on how to learn faster, and remember better, and possibly mastery in the subject that you are after!
This course is structured in a very fun manner, even the quizes are very humourous to answer!"

Inspired to use the tools.
Inspired to share my knowledge of learning.
Inspired by the knowledge of this course flowing to other areas of my interest.

2016-01-15 00:00:00,Cindy R,5.0,0.0,"Por medio del curso he adquirido conocimiento relevante sobre la forma de aprender. Ahora se lo necesario que es para nuestro diario vivir el reestructurar la forma de pensar, estudiar o al momento de estar aprendiendo un determinado tema. Es muy vital tener el conocimiento de como funciona nuestro cerebro al momento de estar almacenando nueva información. Este curso me a despejado muchas duda y la forma en la que explican los temas lo hacen mas accesible y fácil de entender.  "

Nos Peers Assessment corrigi e classifiquei 8 trabalhos, em vez dos 3 requisitados. O Curso foi por vós oferecido após eu o ter solicitado e foi aprovado. Mas até hoje ainda não recebi o vosso Certificado. Se me ofereceram o Curso e tirei uma nota excelente porque não me enviam o dito Certificado? Eu não tenho possibilidades de o pagar.... Agradeço o favor da vossa especial atenção."
2020-03-31 00:00:00,Tyas W P,5.0,0.0,"This course has given me insights on how to improve my learning techniques to help me better understand what I'm trying to learn. I really enjoyed how the instructors explained the materials. Everything was easy to understand and I have been implementing some of the methods or techniques I find effective for me, such as the Pomodoro technique and the spaced repetition. Thank you very much for this wonderful course! I can't stress enough how I recommend this course to anyone."
2019-08-30 00:00:00,Jayne E L ,5.0,0.0,"Outstanding! This is the first Mooc you should take. It will set a new, and firm foundation for learning, retaining, and re-examining how you learn. It reveals how the mind works, and how many of the old ways we were taught to learn aren’t nearly as effective as we thought. Dr Barb Oakley and Dr Terry Sejnowski are so extremely relatable and informative. Love them! After this class, you might really enjoy “ Mindshift “, by them. Waiting for more...hint,hint...Barb and Terry."
2021-01-20 00:00:00,Dominika S,5.0,0.0,"I would recommend this course for everybody. Even if you may not struggle with learning in overall, I believe this course will teach you how to learn more effectively, how to remember things better and longer, and maybe answer your unasked questions... Learning how to learn taught me few amazing tips which I will be using in feature. This course also open my eyes in certain things and give me new insight to a lot of material in terms of learning. Thank you, for this course. "
2020-06-11 00:00:00,Shravani G,5.0,0.0," Firstly, I would like to thank Dr.Terrence sejnowski and  Dr.Barbara Oakley for sharing something which is the foundation of learning which provides a content worth learning by every single being.The best part what I found was that  along with the verbal explanation it is very well illustrated which goes very well with our understanding the concept in a better way.I highly appreciate the background work and would recommend others to get benefited from this course.Thank you."
2017-11-10 00:00:00,Vrymel O,5.0,0.0,"I've learned many things in the course. The insight on the two different modes of thinking is important in learning as I would know that being relaxed and just taking the time away (diffused mode) away from the material can help solidify the concept in the brain. Study habits and even motivation that even the less brilliant can achieve great things is definitely enlightening. 



This course have bring wonders to me, and would definitely recommend it to my friends and family."

2020-08-18 00:00:00,Teresa C,5.0,0.0,"This course was really well presented with lots of references and examples. I was already familiar with most of the principals and techniques discussed and yet I feel like a really learned a lot. The important thing really is to actually apply these concepts in all your studies, make them habitual, and that can only come from practice, persistence, consistency and determination. This course was well worth my time and I also found the in-course interviews quite fascinating."

The quirky humor combined with the useful techniques taught in the course have helped me better understand my learning tendencies. Not only that, my oh-so-persistent habit of procrastination has now been reduced to the brainsize of the zombies of this course. Big thanks to the Pomodoro technique, I kept my procrastination zombie controlled and mostly asleep.


Thanks again guys!"
2017-11-11 00:00:00,Palanisamy K,5.0,0.0,"The first course in Coursera that I have completed is this. I have used many MOOCs like edX,NPTEL,Futurelearn. But no one provide such high quality online courses like Coursera. ""Learn How To Learn"" course is the best one to show how MOOCs(Coursera specially) do great job.
After enrolling this course, I have also purchased the book ""A mind for numbers"". This is really wonderful. The book really changed my learning way and the course ignite me to utilize the MOOCs life long.  "
2017-07-29 00:00:00,Yu-ling,5.0,0.0,"This course is my very first one on Coursera. It provides all the helpful learning tips, scientifically proven, in a fun and easy-to-understand way. I love how the course is designed with short videos and quizzes. The quiz questions are very helpful in recalling the info. I also love how the assignments are designed. All the modules--videos, quizzes, homework, optional reading--were designed with one purpose, i.e., to help the audience learning better. Thank you very much!"
2020-11-22 00:00:00,Kart V,5.0,0.0,"I really
enjoyed the course. Both professors, Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski,
made the course interesting and easy to follow. It made me realise that already
implementing small things in the learning process can make all the difference. I
found the additional interviews with other experts also very valuable - to
learn from their journey has been an inspiration. And finally it is nice to
know that all this not just good advice, but it is also backed up with science. "

Whether this information is for someone who is interested in life-long learning opportunities or for students there were many ideas shared that would help people actually learn information vs. just remembering it for short periods of time.

Not only was the content outstanding but the elearning format was used with a skill beyond anything I had seen before.  I will review every course turned out by this provider in the hope of having another first rate learning experience.  Oh, oh, one more thing the listing of sources was a wonderful addition.  There are several topics where i would like to research further.
WHAT A WONDERFUL EDUCATIONAL OFFERING!!!!!!"
2017-11-04 00:00:00,Glenn P,5.0,0.0,"Some topics like rereading helped me realize that it is not effective and makes me forget the topic and lead to illusions of competence. Pomodoro technique is really effective that helps me focus to process. Chunking got my  interest and wanted to apply this while learning.  I tought neurons never born everyday. They can survive by doing physical exercise. I learned much. Really.
Thank you very much for this course to the nth power. Really helpful. 10 / 5 for this course."
2015-08-18 00:00:00,Yen H P,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course to take for any student. Simplified concepts that are easy to comprehend are neatly organized to hold your focus to teach you the ropes on teaching yourself.

2022-09-14 00:00:00,Donald M,5.0,0.0,"I believe this course should be mandatory for any curriculum that is high-school level and up. How many of us have asked ourselves, ""why do I even have to learn this?"" Well, this course puts things into different  perspectives that allows you to fully understand why curricula are set up the way they are, how YOU learn as an individual, and it offers a myriad of tips and tricks to help improve that learning process. This course is a must! A big thank you to the creators!       "
2021-02-23 00:00:00,Brian H,5.0,0.0,"As a working adult, I found this course to be incredibly insightful. I wish I took this class when I was younger. There are so many things I did wrong in my early learning life that made learning hard for me. I'm using the methods taught in this course in my daily life to learn new things. And I've started sharing these tips with my 8 year old and have seen positive results. Do no underestimate the power of 25 minutes of focus time and you mind in diffuse mode. Amazing.

This course has helped me understand the reasons behind the use of these techniques and how it effects our neural structure. So, it would help me in future to learn tough concepts easily and apply those concepts in the real world. Thank you Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for this course.

2021-07-08 00:00:00,Ana M G ,5.0,0.0,"I really liked ""Learning how to learn"". It made me realise that while I thought I was studying hard, I wasn't applying the best techniques and literally, I was just wasting my time. I don't understand why some people say the tips were quite obvious, as I found some of them actually pretty counterintuitive but amazingly effective! I'm currently on vacations but I'm pretty excited for starting the next semester to apply all of what I've learned in this marvellous course! "
2020-09-08 00:00:00,Lorna W,5.0,0.0,"I am 71 and completed the weeks two and three tests a couple of weeks after learning the material. I was away on vacation and didn't actively think about the course at all. This was a demonstration for me of how clearly the instructors ""walk the talk"". They methods of teaching this course model the concepts being presented. As a lifelong learner, I am extremely excited by what I have learned and will continue to integrate the practices going forward.
Thank you so much!!"
2019-03-10 00:00:00,Ting W,5.0,0.0,"The course is very inspiring and instructive. If we had a chance to learn this course years ago, that would greatly benefit us not only for our studies but for the whole life I think. The way we think leads to what and how we do. But anyway, it's better late than never. I would consciously try to put all what I've learned in this course into use in my real life, I'd love to see what changes is stored for me there. Thanks very much for the wonderful courses you present. "
2018-01-24 00:00:00,Kevin C,5.0,0.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course mainly because it has taught me valuable lessons and learning techniques I can use and revisit in my future studies. I may even revisit this course just to solidify the techniques I have picked up through this course. Growing up, I didn't have many great mentors to teach me how to approach learning through school and various academic areas. I hope to be able to deepen the learned techniques by preaching them and teaching them to others."
2021-02-18 00:00:00,Vladimir U,5.0,0.0,"Even though it's a pretty basic course I still find it useful and important for everyone to attend. If you've never heard of Chunking, Pomodoro technique, Diffuse mode, for instance,  you have to take this course! It's a 4 weeks course but I personally passed it in 4 days cause I was familiar with the material but some of the stuff I learnt only recently from other course (on storytelling) so this course is full of new information regarding learning and brain function"
2020-07-17 00:00:00,Shanna L,5.0,0.0,"Incredible!! I learned so much and all of the curriculum was so easy to absorb and apply. I am now taking 10 other Coursera courses at the University of London, Yale, Stanford, Penn State, Wharton, UC San Diego, Santa Clara University, Columbia University, Macquarie University and Northwesten University, and I am sure to apply all that I leaned from this course to getting what I need from these courses as well.

2018-07-12 00:00:00,Vojtěch L,5.0,0.0,"Great course, lecturers were understandable, supportive and cheerful which helps in continuing. I do recommend this course to all who have very basic idea of how our mind works and want to better understand how to become a better learner. From my perspective I had a feeling that the course is more high school oriented and that's why many things were repeated too many times in very simplistic ways (as opposed to letting people to rewatch a video if they are uncertain)."
2018-02-24 00:00:00,Sharon G,5.0,0.0,"The teachers were knowledgable, clear and gave a very powerful demonstration of learning techniques, with a positive and constructive outlook. The video graphics and illustrations were very helpful in reminding the main concepts and connecting them to new ideas. The interviews were very interesting and the questions asked in them were helpful in recalling the concepts taught in that unit. Finally, the reading lists were comprehensive and again, very useful. Thank You! "

This course is very easy to follow; the analogies & words used are easy to understand. The pace is also neither too fast nor too slow. As for the instructors, you can feel that they are sincere & really want their students to know how to learn. Afterall, no one really teaches you how to learn when you are young, even in schools. So, take this opportunity to learn the different & correct ways of learning by following this course & utilising the techniques taught in it. "
2022-09-22 00:00:00,Ishruth E,5.0,0.0,"Amazing course and an eye-opener for all the learners who want to understand how our brain processes, absorbs and retains information on a long-term basis. This course applies simply to all, not only students and academics, for the simple reason that we all need our brain to learn something and/or anything!!!!
The awareness that I have received through this course has made me conscious of many amazing techniques to learn in a smarter way and more effectively.
Thank you"
2020-11-24 00:00:00,Akram M,5.0,0.0,"The main outcome I got from this course is what is learning and is not for classes and for tests however, for life matter. I really see through course the learning in reality and making mistakes is really normal to master a topic or a course. My vision of a genius learner has been cochor after this course. I saw them in interviews after each chapter and how they are just like us except the preserve to learn to observe a topic. thanks to everyone how made this course. "
2020-08-18 00:00:00,Deboleena T,5.0,0.0,At times it's not about the course but about reassurance and the confidence it gives you to be able to learn effectively again. A lot of these techniques probably I followed when I look back at my college day experiences but I never knew that if it was the correct pattern. It was mostly like a gut feeling for me like 'this works and this doesn't' kind of scenario. But after attending this course it feels like I have learned a major life hack to overcome my learning c
2020-07-24 00:00:00,Surekha T,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course.  I learned many new concepts such as chunking, diffused thinking, Einstellung, and so many new concepts.

It gave me the knowledge of the best techniques and tips to Learn, to Study, to Memorize, to take tests, to join and choose a good study group. Also the Neuroscience behind learning, studying, memorizing. The amount of material learned and the amount of enjoyment this has given me is indescribable. I would recommend this course to everyone at any level. In fact, it should be available to everyone in the world. It is excellent!   "
2017-01-28 00:00:00,Logan B,5.0,0.0,"This course is excellent! I'd say this is a must-take course. It covers many learning techniques supported by science, and it details how to beat procrastination. If (or when) you take this course, make sure to check out the optional readings and interviews at the end of each week as they provide valuable additional information that expand upon and can help solidify the material covered that week. I will definitely be employing the techniques discussed in the course!"

Additionally, I recommend following the book and the course up with the Mindshift course and other readings such as Make It Stick. Lastly, apply what she says. I applied the pomodoro technique, the diffuse thinking, and focus on the process and not the product to be more effective. And, I definitely want to read more into Dr. S."
2017-12-28 00:00:00,Giovanni R,5.0,0.0,"En lo personal ha sido un excelente curso, considero que el contenido descrito en el curso es fundamental para cualquier campo del conocimiento. Es como dar un paso atrás y prepararse para un maratón (una carrera profesional) y entender la importancia del calentamiento y la preparación, en este caso entender los fundamentos del aprendizaje que formara parte de nosotros por siempre, consciente o inconscientemente.  Muchas felicidades a los profesores, son excelentes."

The professors provide actual tools to help you approach the process of learning. You are guaranteed to progress and ultimately flourish regardless of the field or whether or not you have a ""natural"" proclivity for the subject.  I owe a debt of gratitude to Professors Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and to Cousera for offering me this opportunity to learn how to learn.

Os vídeos, além de bastante leves e divertidos, trouxeram informações relevantes e muito bem organizadas. As tarefas associadas a cada conteúdo foram muito úteis para recobrar o material estudado, e o acesso a textos e vídeos adicionais, bem como a possibilidade de fazer download de todo o material, permitem ao estudante ir além da proposta básica. Recomendo muitíssimo!"
2021-08-05 00:00:00,Matías G C,5.0,0.0,"This course is amazing! 
It helped me overcome a lot of learning problems I had and other related ones, like procrastination and habits. The concept of ""chunking"" was a life-changer for me.

I'm really happy with the results, because I started the course feeling lost with my own terrible study habits, and ended up feeling an effective and confident learner.

I highly encourage everyone to take this course. It was one of the best decisions in my life.

Happy learning!

The course helps us reflect on our own learning and on the learning of our own students. I learned a lot and I was able to accumulate knowledge about learning, tips, and techniques to pass on to my students.  My gratitude to the University of California, professors Terrence and Barbara. This was a great learning experience. Thank you for teaching us learning how to learn.  "
2020-09-07 00:00:00,Elif A,5.0,0.0,"Incredible course. It took me three months to complete it. I took my time and practiced everything I learned in the course, on the course material. I have reduced my test anxiety significantly by completing this course and just wish it was available decades ago as a high school student! The material has given me the confidence to pursue many things that scared me prior. Process over product! Kudos to Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski for an outstanding learning experience. "
2020-08-16 00:00:00,Bharat M,5.0,0.0,"I am learning at age 56, that many of my learning techniques were actually quite ineffective. Also, that I can do better going forward(forming new neurons in my hippocampus is a lifelong process!). That is very empowering. The course is very enjoyable, explaining profound concepts in an easy to understand manner with a dash of humor. I originally took the course to inspire by 18 year old who is off to college, but eventually i completed it because I learnt so much. "

I intend on using the methods presented in this course, not only for myself, but for my son as well while he is doing distance learning. I love the way Prof Oakley presented the material, and am looking forward to the other class she presents later in the year. Every Coursera learner should take this class, and I have also recommended it to a few of my friends who are working on their higher degrees!"

I like reading articles or books but when I reading more and more. It happens a lot that I forgot what I just read. When I learning from this lesson, finally understood my old habit, not like recall content. So when I figure out is very easy to use this skill in the future. 
Thanks a lot from a student in Taiwan. "
2021-03-21 00:00:00,Caleb A K,5.0,0.0,"From the perspective of someone who is already in the Engineering workforce, this was very valuable to me. Of course you have to want to get more out of the time you spend studying in the first place. 

I was already doing many of the thinks discussed in this course, but there were many new and interesting learning techniques. I genuinely recommend this to anyone who is willing to step back, and get out of their own way in the learning process. Happy learning folks."
2020-10-22 00:00:00,Aravind V,5.0,0.0,"Throughout my formal years of education, learning was limited to answering questions, mastering a textbook. Basically gaming and understanding the prevalent system without focussing on what value do i really gain by learning and also how to address the fears and deficiencies I have in my learning methods. This MOOC enabled me in demystifying a lot of my wrong beliefs and helped improve my attitude towards learning. Thank you, Barbara Oakley and Terrance Sejnowski!"

Short, to the point, brilliantly edited, full of useful analogies and metaphors; this course can help remove roadblocks and unwanted obstacles from your inner learning ability. Please, do yourself the favor of enrolling in and completing this course. You won't regret it (at least I didn't and I hope you won't either.)"

It's amazing after spending so much of our lives learning new things, we never invest time in how to learn efficiently and effectively. The course has been a real eye opener, and is applicable to everyone at any age. It also educates you in a very lucid manner with various metaphors and animations of how your brain works and how to train it to learn, and retain new information better. Highly recommend this course."

This is by far the best course I have ever taken. It solidifies and explains everything I've known about studying and provides a deeper (yet simple ) understanding of why we behave in certain ways and how we can improve our learning capability.



Barbara Oakley was especially great, she has a good and steady flow and method of explaining that makes it easy for one to understand.



This should be mandatory in every school and university!"

This course should be not only like and optional instead more like a mandatory course at the beginning of the college or even earlier, things could be a lot more easier to do and one can be and feel better.

Right now I have finished my career in Computational engineering and I'm actually working in a big size company, I can tell you that with applying a few things that I missed and learned in this course I feel I did in a week, the work of whole month.

is always difficult to make a first step, but when it is done there is a chance
to see a light at the end of the tunnel. This course got me illuminated and broadened
horizons in the process of learning. I will study hard and make my dream come true
by passing the exam and getting other learning outcomes in different
disciplines. "

All that's needed is the understanding of ""How to Learn"" and the correct process. These are ideas that have brought together things i thought i did right and things that i clearly did wrong like cramming for an exam.
This course has changed the way i look at learning and given me the belief and confidence to not only learn new topics but also enjoy the process of learning."
2020-11-07 00:00:00,Arielle I,5.0,0.0,"
Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski discussed a lot of interesting things about
 the underlying concept of learning. They don't just tell you how to do 
the techniques, they make you understand why you should do the 
techniques, and in turn you'd find that they are very effective and 
helpful. The tests were like practical applications of the discussed 
concept. This course is very useful, i hope i have come across this sooner. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr. 
Sejnowski!

  The course is very relevant to anyone who thinks learning is an ongoing process. It is very important to people who don't think so. The course brings to the forefront the basis of key issues in learning and also provides concrete techniques to help one learn better.

Но очень сложно было сдавать тесты, так как на них перевода нет. Приходилось переводить самостоятельно, и часть смысла терялась при переводе. Поэтому страдало качество работы с тестами. Если есть возможность приложите файл с переводом тестов, так же как с субтитрами.

2020-09-10 00:00:00,Abdullah A,5.0,0.0,"  I learned a lot, I really learned how humans and even animals learn, as the course name ""Learning how to learn"", one of the most important skill that I have learned during this course:chunking : which is simply a process of learning something mostly new to you, and keep practicing it over spaced period of time, by doing this you mainly build chunks that by the time will ""communicate"" with each other which allow you to get a bigger picture of what is going on.

2016-10-04 00:00:00,George,5.0,0.0,This was a great course and i hope more people start to use these techniques. Putting this information in the hands of kids when they are young would be very useful. Also elaborating on metaphors and training to use the memory palace would be very beneficial. Creating a video that asks people to walk through there home placing items in a check list all over then quizzing them on how many items they remembered. similar to the book moon-walking with Einstein. 
2015-11-01 00:00:00,Oscar R S,5.0,0.0,"This course was much more useful than I thought it would be. While there were some parts of the videos that gave some of the usual information about learning, there were a far larger that provided useful, actionable information. I particularly liked how short the videos were. That made it easier to consume individual videos and concentrate on them in a relatively short amount of time ... something I could get done during a break from work or something else."

A good mix of video lectures and quiz material, with end of unit summaries that revisited key ideas and introductions that linked previous material with new concepts. Excellent sharing of resource material, too - I have enough additional reading options to last out the year now!"
2020-05-07 00:00:00,Punyavadee Y,5.0,0.0,"This course helps me a lot in tackling procrastination and make me realized what I've done wrong in my study. The course gives a proper amount of scientific reasons about the brain to support human behaviours and how to deal with them. Every tips and technique taught in the course were also performed and used by course instructors along the way of teaching, and I found those techniques help me a lot in understanding and memorizing the content :) 
Thank you!"
2020-02-27 00:00:00,Faisal N,5.0,0.0,"Absolutely wonderful and must-have course for everyone. It provides you the opportunity to learn how to learn directly from leaders in the field. The explanation provide about how memory works are very easy to understand. The techniques explained are simple, easy and come with explanations about why and how they work. Therefore everything makes a lot of sense, is very clear and to the point. All the lessons can be put to use right after finishing a lesson. "
2019-01-22 00:00:00,Julia O,5.0,0.0,"This is a very useful course for everyone who wants to learn more effectively, understand complex concepts with less effort, retain information more deeply, and master subjects that even look frightening at first. 

No matter if you are studying languages, physics, or programming, you will definitely find some simple and smart techniques for your everyday use. 

I have just completed the course and I will definitely recommend it to my friends and colleagues. "
2017-08-20 00:00:00,Zurbach J,5.0,0.0,"A very insightful and uplifting course. Thanks to it, I collected several useful to tips to increase the efficiency of my learning sessions (e.g. the Pomodoro technique, giving the priority to self-testing instead of re-reading the study material). And I learned several interesting information about great pioneers in neuroscience such as Ramon y Cajal. I am grateful to Dr. Barbara Oakley and  Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for their commitment in this free course."
2015-10-29 00:00:00,Franziska B,5.0,0.0,Thank you to everyone involved in making this course happening. The information offered is vital to understanding how we learn. In my opinion I have learned and finally understood important concepts of learning that I should have learned earlier in my life. I am very thankful for being one of the participants in this class and would suggest it to anyone! Sad that this is not taught in school before we venture out into the world to become a grown up person.
2018-08-26 00:00:00,Aseel T,5.0,0.0,"for many years, I've tried different methods to change the way that I was working and studying, U enrolled this course, I wasn't sure that I'm going to learn something new, after the first week I said woow, I think this is going to work, and it did, it does, it's going to work more, I've learned a lot, this is changed my hole way of learning, getting understanding ourselves, the way that we work, it's the most important step 
thank you so much, appreciated "
2017-01-29 00:00:00,Polina B,5.0,0.0,"I've been learning the whole my life. The whole my life I've been learning in a wrong way, because for some reason or another they don't consider it's worth teaching pupils and students how to learn, which is the first thing I suppose is to be learnt at any education institution. Thank you very much for this course. You have encouraged me to deliver this information to my students. I want to continue working on this topic more deeply at my Master Program. "
2020-07-23 00:00:00,Nischal S,5.0,0.0,"One of the best courses I have come across on Coursera. What makes this course so great is that Prof Barbara Oakley talks about very simple concepts which most of us ""know"", yet shows how it is so obvious that we don't really practice them in our lives. What better motivation to finally practice some of these known tips and tools of Neuroscience than to understand WHY - why we do (or don't do) what we do (or don't do), and what can we do to Learn better."
2020-05-08 00:00:00,Cordell B,5.0,0.0,This course broke down 'learning how to learn' into manageable chunks which enabled me to absorb the information easily. It also made me feel more relaxed about taking on challenging subjects and has helped me to reduce barriers to getting started. Barbara Oakley's simple and accessible teaching style made the course enjoyable. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to change bad habits and acquire the right learning skills to better themselves.

I now understand how to better spend my time studying and that you can learn even those things you don't think your good at. Wonderful help with procrastination and test taking. Not too hard to understand the material and it only takes a bit of work to complete the work and do well on the tests. Anyone can take this course and benefit from it.  Highly recommend taking it, well worth your time. "
2018-05-07 00:00:00,Matthew B,5.0,0.0,"Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski present the material in a fun, engaging way for a general audience.  I highly recommend anyone take this course for the multitude of techniques explained to aid learning and address issues like procrastination and your mindset if you lack self-confidence to learn.  While the material is focused more toward study and school, there is plenty of benefit for professionals and others looking to continue to learn outside of school."

J'ai adoré. Cela m'a permis d'avoir une très belle base et ça me donne envie d'explorer plus en profondeur le sujet. En outre, je trouve que Barbara Oakley a une très belle bienveillance qu'elle réussit à transmettre. Merci !
I loved it. This course allowed me to get a real good grip on learning and gives me a strong desire to explore more deeply the subject. Also I find that Barbara Oakley has beautiful kindness that shows beautifully onscreen.
Thank you! "
2022-07-24 00:00:00,Coursera,5.0,0.0,"I would like to say Barbara Oakley has some of the best teaching skills ever. The dog course instructor was also extremely skilled at teaching me about intelligence when it comes to dogs and humans and other types of apes. But my friend ደ asked me to take this course as well, and it was also pretty fun. The quizzes took some time for me to actually try to pass, but like the instructors said, mistakes are crucial when it comes to learning! Thanks again ደ"
2022-01-18 00:00:00,Ibrahim A,5.0,0.0,This is a must-take course. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski have put together a really great course backed with interviews and scientific papers that demonstrate there is a better way to learn that what most of us intuitively gravitate towards. I am very glad I completed this course and it has already helped me perform better in many areas of my life and be a more effective learner. I cannot recommend this enough for anyone wanting to level up
2021-08-19 00:00:00,Christine S,5.0,0.0,"The course is intelligently designed, well delivered and addresses many common problems all of us face in learning. The techniques I have learnt here have helped me tremendously in navigating my mindset and habit in a more exciting and effective way. Most of all, I have stopped perceiving that I'm just not naturally talented. Instead I know that I can learn anything with the right mindset and techniques.  I'm sure no one would regret taking this course."
2020-11-11 00:00:00,Jessica C D,5.0,0.0,"This course has amazing tips on how to improve learning, how to overcome procrastination, and how to better understand how the brain works in the process of learning.

The course was well thought out and the interactive quizzes provided an excellent way to learn.  Why aren't all universities offering online courses applying this study method to learning?  I also wanted to mention the guest interviews were fascinating.  I learned so much from all of them. Thank you so much Dr. Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.
2019-11-27 00:00:00,Stephen,5.0,0.0,"Schools should teach students how to learn, instead they teach students how to get stressed and fail, then they teach them blame culture. If anyone does well in the pre-university education system in a western country it's usually as much due to accident as design. This course undoes many of the misconceptions that western education systems drill into student's heads. This course will teach you the skills to effectively learn with joy instead of stress."
2019-10-20 00:00:00,Coursera,5.0,0.0,"See ""A Posting about Anxiety, Depression and PTSD from a Learner in Learning How to Learn"" as my thoughts have been posted previously by a learner. It is comforting to know we share the same experience and I now have the tools to combat decades of procrastination. There were many simple tools given but as stated in the video, the learning environment in academia is based on product not process. I only wish I would have learned this in elementary school."
2019-06-21 00:00:00,Anastasiia K,5.0,0.0,"This course is absolutely amazing, I would even say life-changing. Not only it helps to understand the basics of the brain's nature in terms of learning, but it also helps to embrace yourself, and what's the most important -- to believe in yourself. This is exactly what I so desperately needed in this period of my life. 
Thank you so much, Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski. You've done an amazing job creating this course and sharing so many valuable insights. "

As an educator I am always trying to find ways for myself and my students to learn effectively.  This course has given me some great information (with plenty of citations and options for further reading) as well as useful tools I can use in the classroom.  In addition, Dr. Oakley has a fun personality which really shines through.  Thank you for this course!"
2015-10-11 00:00:00,Ashley L K,5.0,0.0,"This course practices what it preaches. Learning how to learn requires doing the techniques taught on how to learn. It's chunked nicely and gives great real-world examples of how to apply these techniques. Biological and psychological concepts are incorporated which helps to add to realities and destroy misconceptions about learning. Fantastic course, will be taking it again and again over the years to really learn the material and share it with others."

I still have a long way to go to apply all these new concepts in my life (both academic and social life) but I'm sure they will bring fruitful results. Thank you for all the team members that has made this course happen. Kudos to all of you! To new learners this will surely aid you in ways you never imagined. Happy Learning! "
2020-06-28 00:00:00,Anurag S,5.0,0.0,"This course gives you amazing insights into our brain working and gives ample technique to change and put to practice different techniques to learn with scientific explanations. It also deals with time management, healthy lifestyle, stress management, test-taking and preparation strategies. It is surprising to know that how doings thing that we have been doing a little bit differently would have given us significant improvement over the results we get. "
2019-12-27 00:00:00,Miso B,5.0,0.0,"A course recommandable to anyone. Please take some time to read and view the optional material if you take on this course, they are a wonderful addition.
This course has boosted my confidence, as someone with a heavy past of mental illness. As I was going through the course I have become more productive. I also fully gained back my love for learning, and it awakened in me a interest for teaching. I hope I can help many people, as this course did for me. "
2019-11-09 00:00:00,Jose R,5.0,0.0,"I have been reading on productivity methods and learning techniques since I was in highschool, but this course glues everything together. It explains the neuroscience behind learning, and by making sense of how our brain works, it gives you the best tips for learning more, and better, and how to be more productive and avoid procrastination. I believe this is a lifelong lesson and I will be very grateful to this course and the instructors in the future."
2021-03-31 00:00:00,Kaushal S,5.0,0.0,It was one of the best online courses I have ever taken so far. The tools and techniques taught in this course will help in my life I am pretty sure of that. I find myself very lucky that I stumbled across this course at the right time in my life. I would have scored much better in my previous classes if I have found this course earlier. I would encourage everyone reading this to take this course before learning anything crucial in life. Best of Luck!
2019-09-14 00:00:00,Nikhitha S,5.0,0.0,"As a college student, this course forced me to focus on the real truth of studying habits. I hope to use the habits learned from this course to make my college habits better. I have learned how to study and which aspects of studying to focus on. I also realized that most of the time my laziness wins over me and I choose methods of studying that are ""harder"" but are actually easier and won't learn, than choosing the difficult way and actually learning. "
2019-06-21 00:00:00,Samyak S,5.0,0.0,"
The course content is quite good and it explains things backed with logical explanations, solid research and interesting interviews. The graphics used are not 'the best' but great enough to make you understand things. It is quite evident that a lot of effort has been put in creating the content of this course
I strongly feel that this course will affect the way I learn other things, and is a great way to start with online courses. Strongly recommended."

But actually we don't understand how the brain function works. By understanding the mechanism, we could build a better leaning skill which means to be more productive. I would love to practice all the skill and try to share with my family and friends. Hope that everyone could learn better and change life. "

It changed my way and actually I am looking forward to take on tough subjects (for me) to apply focussed and diffused modes, add to this a good sleep and the Pomodoro technique!  Thank you so much for the time both Mrs Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski have spent on this course, I am so greatful to you

The course teaches proven techniques for learning that can be applied to any discipline, while taking this course, I was able to use all the techniques mentioned, on the final project, I found my self procrastinating, and having to use the pomodora technique, All in all a very rewarding course, I highly recommend.  "

During my exams I have been spending all night on preparation without realizing this could have negative effect. I am recommending this course to all my co-worker. This is a meta-learning course which tells how to learn. I have a Ph.D and it is very sad I did not know about this until now. But, it is never too late and there is so much more to learn. Happy Learning :)"
2016-02-01 00:00:00,Rehma S S,5.0,0.0,"Learning How To Learn is a great course for those who aren't sure about their learning tactics like I was before I joined. The professors give plenty of tools to get you ready for your next course. It is amazing! I have learnt so much, being someone who just didn't have any study tricks. I have picked up many techniques and knowledge on how to learn and how my brain works in the process.  This is something I wish I had had or done earlier on in life."

It would've helped me tremendously in my studies. Nevertheless, I am really excited that I took this course because this is truly the metaphor ""teaching someone how to fish and you'll feed them for a lifetime"". Learning how to learn truly ""taught me how to fish"". Thanks Professor Oakley for putting this course together!"

The instructors Barbara and Terrence are clearly passionate about the topic; it's reflected in the high quality of the course. I liked all aspects of the course, but I really appreciated all the optional interviews they did. It's great to have so many different perspectives on learning how to learn. I was able to take away something (even if only one or two things) from every interview."
2016-03-29 00:00:00,Michael L,5.0,0.0,"LHTL was a great course that provided me with beneficial study habits with reasoning behind why they worked so well. I am guilty of cramming for a test the night before, which I now regret because I didn't take the time to actually learn the material and create new neural pathways to solidify the knowledge. I wish I had taken this course before graduating college. I would recommend this to anyone getting ready to attend their first college semester. "
2022-03-08 00:00:00,C Y,5.0,0.0,"There are more techniques I can use in this course than I expected before I started. I want to share these ideas with my students. The title is very attractive, because I've been thinking teachers taught us each subject, and they encoureage us saying do your best, study harder, but they never taught us the way of learnig. This course's contents match my long term questions. I love learning, so I am really thankful for this couse. Thank you so much."

full of new concepts on how to hack your brain to learn better. The interviews with different experts also give me a lot of insight on strategies on how they learn and thus excel in their field. It makes me sad to only know about these theories 
and techniques after I've already graduated, but I'll definitely be able
 to use them for my licensure exam. Highly recommended course!"

I was aware of some of the concepts in learning as I have been an instructor myself for 15 years and took a few Masters classes, but I was amazed at how a lot of this applied not only to learning, but just every day life.  The instructors did an excellent job of explain each of the concepts, and I have a much better understanding of the brain and why we make mistakes in learning.  Overall, I really enjoyed this course."

One of the best things I learned was that I would say many already do some form of some of these methods, but lack the confidence to show it. This course accentuates that and is a confidence builder in itself minus the all the additional knowledge involved. I highly recommend to those both young and old in search of a way to see things differently.  "

The material could be summarized into a shorter course, but it would not come with the explanation of the reasons WHY the methods work, and it is likely that you will get more value by completing this full course and following the methods outline here with confidence."

The concepts taught in the course were easy to grasp and the abundance of visual aids really helped in the delivery of the material. I would recommend this course to anyone regardless of educational attainment or age."

If you want to achieve more in life and make progress in a specific or in different fields, then attend the course and become a well-trained and educated learner!"
2017-08-16 00:00:00,Bren L,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed this class very much. I got a new understanding of learning I sure could've used when I went to school years ago. But as Dr. Barbara points out several times, it's never too late. I especially enjoyed the glimpse into the neuroscience of how we learn. Fascinating! It makes me want to dig deeper.
The course is over and I still review my notes and hand write new ones to keep the ideas in my mind.  I am grateful for this course -- thank you."
2016-11-12 00:00:00,Gabriela,5.0,0.0,"Excelente curso. No solo aprendes excelentes técnicas de memorización y aprendizaje, sino que también te motiva a aprender más por tu cuenta, a buscar nuevas técnicas que te puedan ser útiles a ti (pues a algunos les funcionan más algunas técnicas que otras) y a entender que si no comprendes algo no es necesariamente porque no tengas la capacidad sino que necesitas acercarte al problema desde otra perspectiva, pues todos somos capaces de aprender."

Este curso te da varias estrategias para no rendirte y mantenerte siempre aprendiendo usando diferentes tecnicas y produndizando que hay detras de ciertos comportamientos personales desde la perspectiva neuronal. Recomendado!"
2020-12-07 00:00:00,Margaret P,5.0,0.0,l found the lectures and breadth of material -including optional readings and interviews very engaging. I was particularly interested to know that Barbara Oakley had previously been a Slavist. This was my own initial field of study and so I felt her observations when switching to a scientific subject were highly relevant. I hope to put many of the ideas of Learning How to Learn into practice and I would welcome further courses from this provider.

Taking this course gave me insight into how we learn, and how to learn effectively. Even though testing is no part of my life now (outside the annual blood test), learning remains a critical piece of working life. This course helped me get more from the texts I read and re-use pertinent information needed in my daily life. Thanks for helping me learn how to learn!

2019-09-01 00:00:00,JESS T,5.0,0.0,"It is excellent and course,
to show you how to learn effectively and also cope with procrastination. Well
structured course, with each week of the material enables me to apply it right
away. By understanding how our brains work, it allows to take control and
strategize learning. The interviews with various well-known and successful
learners or people at the end of each course week also provide interesting and useful insights
about how they learn.  "
2018-10-07 00:00:00,Noura E,5.0,0.0,This course became a part of my day. I began to apply what I learned in my studies and in any work I do. It helped me a lot in learning my unlimited mental skills and how to use them and arrange them. I learned from the course that I have to trust in my new system that I started to arrange my time and to organize my ideas so that I can make full use of it. I really trust and use it and thank everyone who helped to bring it out in this smooth way.
2017-10-13 00:00:00,Amr F,5.0,0.0,"Honestly, This was my first course to finish on coursera. before I used to view some courses and leave them by max 2nd week. But That course content is very attractive. you feel like, every think you are looking for, or you want to have answers for, are ready for you. I would do recommend this course to any one who have problems with time management, procrastination, problems with focusing, bad memory. 
Thanks Barbara and Sejnowski! really thanks!"
2016-08-06 00:00:00,Cloris,5.0,0.0,"Although some students they think it's unnecessary to take such a course, because they have studied since they're born. I don't think so, when people get familiar with somethings, they would become lazy and don't want to change it anymore. This course helps me a lot, I realize I study in an inefficient way and begin to follow this new and efficient way. I also use calendar to plan at the same time. I'm very appreciate for this fantastic course!!!"
2020-06-17 00:00:00,Hadil L,5.0,0.0,"A very powerful course that made me feel that I am not alone with a lot of issues in memory that seemingly are suffered by many people. Also, the course materials depend on science and experiences which are the fundamental basis of strong and trusted materials. Providing references, the way of explaining some terms and issues, the interviews, and the tests are just amazing and helpful. Thank you, Coursera, and thanks to the tutors of the course. "
2017-11-02 00:00:00,Amar D,5.0,0.0,"This was a highly engaging and educational class.  While the theoretical and scientific underpinnings were interesting, the practical approaches to learning is what really appealed to me.  There are so many techniques that I am taking away from this class that I plan to put to use in my learning journey(s).  Prof. Oakley is a great teacher and has a knack for teaching complex things using analogies, metaphors and funny visuals.  Thank you, Prof!"
2016-12-21 00:00:00,Tanvi,5.0,0.0,"One of the best MOOCs I have ever taken. It is very practical, and can be used in your everyday life.
The brain is a powerful tool. We use our brains 24*7, and NOT learning how to effectively use this powerful brain is the single biggest mistake anyone can make.
I would recommend this to students, working professionals, teachers, parents of school going children and even to people who are into sports.
Join the course! I promise it will be worth it!"
2022-07-31 00:00:00,Eric F,5.0,0.0,​so excited i was able to tske this class as i wsd definitely one of the bad learners and always lacked finishing the product because i didnt focuse more on the process of the task. This wont only help me out in school for IT tech but also in life and any other thing i would to do and learn . So thankful for this oppuritnotu from the great instructors and everybody involved that teached us how to learn and cant wait till change my life around !

But in the other hand with my life experience I've learned much more from this course, because I know what I've done right or not. Actually I am very very very glad, that I've met this course. Dr. Oakley with her scientific argumentation and her kind way of belief that you can do everything gives me the confidence and tools to achieve what I want. It really changes my life. Thanks you all!"
2020-12-23 00:00:00,Preeti L,5.0,0.0,"This was an amazing course and I think it should be mandatory for students in school having access to virtual libraries. This course has taught me so much and I've realized so many mistakes that I've made while trying to learn something. With all my newly acquired knowledge, I hope to learn many more things, not as a burden but as to improve my skill set. I am very glad that I completed this course and I will surely recommend it to many others. "

It helps me to study more effectively.

But as you know, If you do nothing, Any lectures are useless.
You should find something actually makes you MOVE.
And  in my opinion, that ""something"" is always in your inside.
You don't have to go too far to find ""something"".
If you want to get an answer from a distance, there will be an answer from a distance.
But If you want to get an answer from nearby, there will be an answer nearby."

Definitely !!! The most wonderful experience ... The course had so much information, backed by scientific research, step wise explanation, pumped with motivation, making it so very easy to understand,register and remember ( If I got the sequence right).
WOW 3 CHEERS for the group of COURSERA ... For making it happen for new Entrants like me, To the world of Learning.     "

They also give you interviews of people, who work in different fields, which talk about how they could go so far only with a basic and solid tool for learning how to learn. 
I'm a person who procrastinates about everything, also daily life tasks. So I strongly suggest approaching this course to understand better how to manage difficult situations.  "

I used to think that I was good for nothing, but now I see it's just my Zombies, and I can really learn anything if I know how to learn. More than anything else it helped me with procrastination. Believe it or not, using these techniques  I actually had more done during these 4 weeks than I had in the past year! I strogly recommed this course especially to perfectionsts like myself. "
2019-06-17 00:00:00,Jumilah B A,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course.  Its easy to understand and the skills taught are useful.  It is like a course refresher for me as the name implies, ""Learning to Learn"".   I am excited taking the quiz at the end of each topic.  I am a Malay Language teacher and had just completed my Master in Education.  However, after completing this course there is definitely some takeaway for me like example the ""Pomodoro Technique"".
I enjoyed the course.  Thank you! "

This course is excellent. One of the best course I did in my life. Tips like pomodoro, deliberate practice, gave me deep insights on to how we really learn and master subjects. More importantly, this course now gave me the confidence that I can learn anything with an attitude of learning even though I have no talent/interest towards it. Thanks for the instructors , for taking the time and putting it all together and giving it free via coursera. "
2015-12-25 00:00:00,Marjan M,5.0,0.0,"Great course. Things that EVERYONE should know are presented in such a great way. Prof. Oakley's voice sounds so calm, but yet persuading, she really knows how to teach. Dr. Sejnovski brought great facts about how that complex machine called brain works, but in a very understandable manner. Course production is great: sound, images, just everything. I will surely visit most of additional material too, there are very interesting clips and texts."
2021-05-09 00:00:00,Brenda T,5.0,0.0,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful course.   I wish I had known about it years earlier.  It is a compilation of a plethora of  learning and memory tools, and of how the brain works to explain our motivations and how to work with ourselves.

I would however have liked a ""real life"" set of examples showing how what was taught would change or fit into the workflow of an actual student.

Thank you so much for providing this course!"

My daughter is about to go to college so I was sure to be an annoying momma and share with her all the tips and tricks even tho she is so very sure she knows it all already ;-) The tips for stopping procrastination in its tracks were wonderful, and the idea that ""practice makes *permanent*"" rather than *perfect* was rather eye-opening. I highly recommend the course."

Well, I'm proud to say that I'm currently applying some of the techniques in studying taught in this course like pomodoro and diffuse mode of thinking. This course makes you aware of your own learning strengths and weaknesses. But at the end of the day, as Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski said, we are all in the driver's seat of our learning.  "

I think every college freshman would benefit by taking this course in the first semester. It was well designed and practiced the skills it taught - spaced repetition, recall, testing for example. The extra reading resources were excellent and enhanced and reinforced what the course offered."

As an individual who believes in ""life-long learning"", I found the information and strategies in this course to be broadly applicable to life in general.  The session on dealing with procrastination  (focusing on process over product) was particularly eye-opening for me.

Personally, I find both of the instructors a bit awkward, but in a very cute way. Also, they don't just talk the talk, they also walk the walk. Very inspiring and enlightening course to talk for anyone who is interested in improving their own learning abilities!"

My only regret is that a lot of the topics talk about ""problem solving"" and I'm still a little unclear as to what to do when what you're studying has seemingly nothing to do but is mostly about trying to remember facts, and dates, and definitions.
I guess I'll have to get started and see how I can apply the techniques of this course in my new student life!"

It was full of great strategies and has helped me pass a demanding professional exam that i had been struggling with for the previous three years.I have purchased the companion book for this course, and even the children's version by Dr Oakley, to have a refference of the matrerial and to share this with my own children.I will continue to follow the work of Dr. Barbara Oakley & Dr. Terrence Sejnowski  "
2018-06-20 00:00:00,Timothy M,5.0,0.0,This is an excellent course on how humans learn and retain information. I think this should be essential learning for every student. It has changed how I approach learning and I find new skills to practice every week throughout the course.Take some time to go through the course and learn how you can more effectively retain information. I found it to be extremely helpful in my life of learning and it has changed the way I approach learning.

 In this course I've learned lots of things about how to learn, how to memorize the information that I learned, how my brain works and how to use my brain to learn with more efficient.You guys really should take this course if you want to be more efficient and productive in school or university.  "
2021-05-02 00:00:00,Ericelmo A S A,5.0,0.0,Very easy is to understand the course. I plan to review it in the future because I believe the course has timeless lessons. Because the brain is built in a certain way I don't expect it to change in my lifetime. I believe learning is a lifetime skill and the basics should be mastered. Whatever the new subject is the beginning of learning tends to be similar to something you learned in the past. I highly recommend the MOOC. Happy learning!

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone taking this course to take it slowly and do notes video by video. Only one thing I saw weird was the small typos and inconsistency in the notes format! It didn't really matter much in terms of the content, the only thing that could be improved from a simple point of view is that because the content is impeccable. "
2019-10-20 00:00:00,Justin L,5.0,0.0,"  I luckily overheard some very smart software engineers who sit near my cubicle talking about how great this course was for them. I must say after completing this course, I feel reinvigorated to learn more than ever. Both complacency and procrastination are two vices I'm now ready to let go of! Thank you Barbara Oakley, Dr. Terry Sejnowski, the Learning How To Learn team, and Coursera for developing and delivering such an outstanding MOOC!  "
2019-06-18 00:00:00,Adrian M,5.0,0.0,"How do you prepare for an exam? Well, all we have different ways for that, but this course helps you get very efficient techniques for a good learning.

2018-04-04 00:00:00,Luis p,5.0,0.0,"Amazing Course.  ""Learning How to Learn"" ought to be a personal pre-requisite to all the other courses.  By Learning How to Learn, we make learning more effective. I thoroughly enjoyed how the course was presented and laid out.  The course applied all the principles it teaches.  And, the bonus material attached is very pertinent, interesting, and joyful to view. Especially the student that learned many languages. 
Great course!  Thank you!

2016-02-15 00:00:00,Elina H,5.0,0.0,Awesome course! Learning is explained in simple terms and the tips and best practices really stick to your memory. The course has definitely achieved what it is teaching - which is making sure you remember the material by testing yourself and by utilizing spaced repetition. I loved the simplicity of the course. Make sure you watch all optional interviews as they are with people who achieved great results in the area of learning or memory.
2022-06-07 00:00:00,Lena s,5.0,0.0,"Great course! I recomend eveyone to take it, as believe me you will learn a lot of techniques and concepts about learning and even laugh from some test possible answers.
Also as a hint a recommend following the course curricular and doing it during a week  ( not just rush and do everything in a day or week, what you can do as lectures are small) but spent 30 minutes a day to get the best results and to have time to memorize all techniques"
2021-03-19 00:00:00,Pradeep N,5.0,0.0,"Though I had good discipline with respect to exercise , sleep and good eating habits, I was not able to apply this on my learning may be because its been 14 years I am out of college. I procrastinate and get distract alot. After this course, I am using the pomodoro technique very effectively ad its doing wonders to me. thanks to Barbara oakley for teaching this and few other very effective practical steps. This course is real gem and fun"
2016-08-11 00:00:00,Kyle O,5.0,0.0,"A great course! This course provides a comprehensive coverage of different learning techniques, as well as different theory behind 'learning how to learn.' The instructors are enthusiastic, and provide many different backgrounds to learning -- the neurological, biological, and psychological aspects of learning are are covered. A good course to compete for anyone who wants to improve their ability to learn new things and think critically."
2015-09-18 00:00:00,Frank B,5.0,0.0,"A wonderful course and one that I would (and will) recommend to anyone staring any learning journey! If you are planning on beginning a learning journey - it makes sense to pack your bag with the best tools and techniques to make that journey productive and fun!
That's what this course does! It equips you to make the most of your time and effort in Coursera and elsewhere. 
Take this course first - learn the techniques - revisit and review. "
2020-11-30 00:00:00,Fahrudin e,5.0,0.0,"It is a great course, and I can learn many things which significantly changing my perspective about learning.  I have contemplated my learning process and found not only a different angle but also a different way to learn effectively. The product is still the focus, and procrastinating is a dominant part of my life before.  Your course gave me the answer.   Enjoy the learning process because everyone has the own way. Thank you, Barbara."
2020-04-21 00:00:00,Anna V,5.0,0.0,"Отличный курс! Много интересных идей, которые можно использовать и ученикам школы, и тем, кто уже давно получил образование. Отдельное спасибо за русский перевод текста. Уверена, что большинство советов, полученных мной на курсе, смогу использовать в жизни. Отличные и мотивирующие интервью. Многое, что мне казалось непреодолимыми препятствиями в обучении (изучаю немецкий язык с нуля) выглядит уже не так страшно :) Спасибо авторам курса!"
2020-04-16 00:00:00,Siddharth S,5.0,0.0,"The course, in short, was an eye-opener to me. The title of the course justifies the course itself and I pretty much enjoyed myself doing this. I was reminded that it's okay if you are not the smartest one in the room and yet you can still contribute abundantly! I've added so many learning tools to my arsenal and I'll efficiently use them! Thank you to the instructors for such a wonderful course and I hope other students find it useful!"
2019-11-21 00:00:00,SunKee H,5.0,0.0,"I think every high school student and new undergrad students will benefit from this. It's nice and short, and easy to understand. The concept of ""Chunking"" might confuse you at first, but just think of it as a bit of knowledge you gain about a subject; e.g. You learn about how bicycle gears work; that's a chunk. You learn about photosynthesis; that's a chunk. You learn how hierarchy matters in the Korean language Hangul; that's a chunk."
2018-06-14 00:00:00,Ana J d A F,5.0,0.0,"Great course! Great tips! It's incredible how people dedicate themselves to help others and you can see this in this course. Even though you think you master how to study, you never know enough and there's always a way to learn more and more. With this course and wonderful instructors you can find out more about how your brain works, and how you can improve your learning techniques (and throw others away that you think it is effective)."
2015-12-27 00:00:00,Nadisha W,5.0,0.0,"This was the first course I have ever taken online and although I have nothing to compare it to, I absolutely loved it! I've never been able to stay focused or have the discipline to finish any type of education and I managed to finish this, staying interested the entire way through! I loved the material, the two professors and how they executed the work and lessons. This course is so helpful and such a motivational boost, thank you! <3"
2020-05-17 00:00:00,KAREN G H S,5.0,0.0,"This course has teach us  the best learning skill. The Pomodoro technique is a good keys for us to complete our hard task and overcome Procrastination. Fews skill that really inspiration are practice make prefect, promodoro, focus & diffuse, wirking memory, concept for learning step and focus attention and the last is the value of teamworks.
I foreseen after this we are more able to complete our reading or working task more efficiently. "
2016-12-04 00:00:00,Stephen G,5.0,0.0,"Beats all the books I've read on the topic, hands down. Superb learning course that is as hands-on practical as you could want. Excellent instructors, with an excellent presentation of materials. Instructor puts into practice the elements of learning to reinforce what is being taught. My only regret is that this course wasn't around when I was a spring chicken but our understanding of how people learn was wrong at that time. Thank you!"
2016-07-06 00:00:00,saria s,5.0,0.0,"Thank you very much, this course was very helpful for me, I finished my university studies and I had to leave my country because of the war and I could not continue my caree in the new country , this course showed me that it did not stop at this point and I can follow up and even learn the field complitly different, also gave me a lot of tips that will help in learning a new language (and this is something I need for now). thanks again"
2020-09-02 00:00:00,Federico A A B,5.0,0.0,"Great course! It gets a bit repetitive in the last week and starts to become a self-help course on studying if you enjoy studying. But that doesn't overshadow the general positive and scientific content on how to deal with learning. I am already applying the techniques and now understand better how to approach my studies. I am really thankful for the advices, the techniques and the plain language used by instructors. Great experience."
2020-05-25 00:00:00,Tracy S,5.0,0.0,"What a wonderful and empowering experience! this course has been! As Professors Oakley and Sejnowski eloquently stated in the summary, for too long we have focused on the product and not the process of learning. Using a fun, engaging and accessible approach, they teach how anyone can learn more effectively. Highly recommend for learners (and leaders) of all ages. A must for educators who are interested in developing lifelong learners. "
2020-05-03 00:00:00,Devang J,5.0,0.0,"The course is excellent for all types of people- students, teachers, working professionals, house-makers, retired people and more. its presented in a very lucid style -simple and engaging. The course draws upon various scientific findings which are weaved to present a whole picture. The course presents many learning strategies which are easy to implement. in fact the course itself uses these strategies to make learning very effective. "
2019-05-23 00:00:00,Cody K,5.0,0.0,"I learned so much about my brain and the processes imperative to seeing how I can learn things in a short amount of time and with a strong understanding. I have been and will use the strategies outlined in this course throughout my life to not only learn quicker, but also to do things that I would not have done without the class. This is because our brains naturally prohibit some things unless an effort is made to change those things."
2018-04-27 00:00:00,Alexey B,5.0,0.0,"it's a useful guide on how to work with your own brain in case of any type of learning including new languages, different subject or whatever you are attempting to do. it's a pity i didn't have a chance to pass this course, when i was in a high school or even earlier, it could be a great support for my studying.
teachers of the LHTL are absolutely great, they give a clear view on the subject with lots of evocative metaphors and images. "
2022-01-23 00:00:00,TOYAMA S,5.0,0.0,"This is really great course. I have got a tons of great ideas to start learning anything. This is exactly the first course in my Coursera. So I can fully utilize this idea to learn other courses as well. f you talk about Course, you can also enjoy course with free edition. BUT I highly recommend you to take this course with paid option since such mini-test and report creation are strongly connected to the core concept of this course."
2021-05-09 00:00:00,Ratanon H,5.0,0.0,"This course has me to look back into the basic of how I learned, is that learning method work effectively? And how to improve my bad habits about learning to be more productive learner. This course also explain the neurological function associated with the learning process, habit formation and what you can do about it. All by all, It's an interesting course and probably can improve your learning habit if you put these tools into use."
2020-08-13 00:00:00,Blanka K,5.0,0.0,"One of the greatest courses I've ever taken! The professors explained the material well and in depth, and gave lots of practical tips we could start using immediately. The course was also built up in a way that it was easy to remember the material, and we were quizzed only on the actually important parts. What's more, it gave me loads of motivation and enhanced my love of learning. I would recommend this course to literally everyone."
2020-06-05 00:00:00,Ahmed A,5.0,0.0,"A lot of the stuff I knew already, but didn't realise how effective they were and how I was taking the wrong approach to implementing them. The concept of Einstellung and Interleaving my studies within the same pracistise sessions has really helped me understand my flaws when approaching learning. Overall it was a success, following the tips in the course I have managed to curb my procrastination for good...hopefully. Would recommed!"
2020-05-19 00:00:00,Kevin G,5.0,0.0,"Great material, well presented.  The delivery is in bite size pieces making it easy to fit around a busy schedule.  It delivers on the class description of learning how to learn with practical, apply immediately concepts as well as helpful background and context of the science behind the ideas and recommendations.
I highly recommend this course for anyone that is still learning and growing in their lives - which hopefully is everyone!"
2020-05-12 00:00:00,Summer L,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed the course very much. I like the learning methods and techiniques taught with scientific knowleadge and evidence. I also enjoyed the fun presentation style (zombies, pinball, fun pictures, etc.) that drew my attention. I also highly recommend that people listen to the optional interviews.

2019-10-05 00:00:00,Reda L,5.0,0.0,"I've been going through a series of enrolling and giving up on this course for years, and by doing that I wasted many opportunities to learn how to learn properly and I could've avoided many mistakes I made during these years.
This has been a pleasure to attend, it was very informative. One thing that could improve are the videos themselves, I think that they need a visual refresh because they look somewhat dated, otherwise top-notch!"
2019-06-02 00:00:00,Ousmane S,5.0,0.0,"This course has help me overcome my greatest obstacle procrastination and improve my self-study for life long learning. I wish I had found that course back when I was taking my Electrical Engineering courses. It would make a huge difference on time I invest on studying.

The instructions were clear, the topics were meaningful and I have learned to look at my academic materials in a new way. I have just started a new semester and I am excited to face the challenges with everything I have learned here. Thank you very much.   "
2019-05-10 00:00:00,John r,5.0,0.0," Many thanks to Terry and Barbara for their generous spirit in sharing and showing  how   the brain learns. I am  58 and have gained an understanding of how my brain learns as well as  skills and techniques to tap this potential. I have noticed already an increased ability to recall and learn material. It is reassuring to have a learning structure and plan that is effective as I seek to learn Te Reo Maori.

I learned a lot of thing about how my brains work and how I can have an influence on how I can study better. I learned so much in 4 weeks than I learned in 1 year at school. This course is very important for everyone. Everyone has to go to school to study, but no one actually learned how to study. I recommend this course for everyone, young and old. You are never old to learn!

2016-01-29 00:00:00,Annabelle E D,5.0,0.0,"It helped me try new things and revealed to me a wealth of information that otherwise would still be unknown to me if not for me enrolling in this course. It was also made more friendly to us youth because of analogies on zombies and vampires :)
One thing that I was slightly bothered about was the volume of the videos. Maybe an increase in volume would make it less hard for people who have to access Coursera in noisy places to listen. "
2015-11-11 00:00:00,William D G P,5.0,0.0,"I've studied only one week in this course and is fasinated, why? Becouse it explain the big concept about HOW the brain works in relation with the knowlegde. 
I'm mechanical engineer (from colombia) and I'm studying english in Boston Mass. This experience has been amazing but sometimes I've felt frustrated, it's not easy. I think ""Learning how to learn"" will help me to improve my skill while I save time studying. 
Thanks you very much. "

I will keep myself informed of what goes on in relation to learning how to learn. My time in the four-week journey to learning how to learn turns out to be one of the best moments in 2015. I hope that that moment keeps making impacts on my future learning. Thank you so much!

I have been mostly self taught most of my life. And still this course had many ideas that were new to me, and some that i had a hunch on but could never really phrase or explain to myself or others. 
I have implemented some of the advices given in the course and can say that at least for me they work perfectly. There's no doubt my learning and productivity will improve with the new knowledge this course has given me."
2022-10-02 00:00:00,himang g,5.0,0.0,"A​ very effective course on one of the basic things in life -- ""learning"". The way Dr, Barbara Oakley makes you understand the different concepts or wrong habits we are doing with such calmness and patience, helps you keep coming back to the course and implement the solutions in your life.

However, I got much more than I had planned for, in a positive way. The teachers are very understandable, the content is extremely helpful inside and outside the classroom, and the extra content is great to dive into. I love all of it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their studies by tenfolds."

I was a little worried that a subject so vulnerable to subjective analysis might consist of pseudo-science and politically correct agendas, but I was pleased to discover that the exact opposite was true--the course concepts were presented clearly, memorably, and with entertaining methods and the facts presented were well researched and referenced. Thank you for putting this course together"

The course is going to be taken by my children. Prof Barbara O was phenomenal, an example of person walking the walk and talking the talk.

I appreciated you shared your knowledge to understand  and learn about the available resources in our brain, and the different techniques to improve our skills to learn different topics.
I highly recommend to read the ""A mind for numbers"" book during and after this course, it is very easy to understand and it is a great supplement for the class.
Thank you so much for all your work and congratulations."
2017-09-17 00:00:00,Erin G,5.0,0.0,"Great course to learn new study skills and understand why what you might be doing isn't helping.  My first week of my math class I spent nearly 20 hours studying and now I spend only around 5 hours a week and retain more using the techniques mentioned.  I still have room to improve too!  (Although the amount of time probably won't drop any more, I will probably be able to retain the information better once I get flashcards down)."
2017-05-18 00:00:00,Renee H,5.0,0.0,Best thing I've done in years! Feel really prepared and actually excited about some upcoming study.

2015-09-19 00:00:00,Hafsa S,5.0,0.0,"I would recommend to individuals from all walk of life. Its so motivating, easy to comprehend and addresses our basic issues in learning tough things. It has provided with simple tips that can be used in our daily life. I am using them and results are tremendous. Above all, it has given me an insight that we can master things that we are not naturally good at. I am extremely thankful to the instructors and Coursera! Stay blessed."
2019-12-29 00:00:00,Edward T,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course, and I recommend it to every student and every graduate and anyone else who doesn't mind it when they take their coat out the closet on the first cold day of the year and discover a $20 bill that they didn't know they had. That is, many will discover in this course capabilities that they had all along, but were unaware of.  It is free!  My advice is to dive in, get started, and see where it leads you."
2016-03-20 00:00:00,Arne,5.0,0.0,"Pretty good course. I got a few techniques and habits/routines out of it, which I plan to adopt. On the critical side, I usually like my material free of zombies and pinball machines, but that's me. I feel the zombie analogy is handy during the course, but falls short as you move on to more advanced understanding. Also, I would remove ""easy"" from the answer to 21 d (I think that was the question).

But overall, a very good course."
2020-06-15 00:00:00,Pisavadia P A,5.0,0.0,"It was great for people like me cause when so ever I got fail in some subjects I used to think that I'm a talented person it's not my fault, I used to blame the teacher for these but after these course I'm getting to think that I'm the one who was lacking with the skills how to learn.
Everything about these course is way too great.
Thanks to the team of coursera and especially to Prof. Barb Oaklay and Prof. Terence. 
Thanks A Lot."

I learned a lot of interesting things for successful training and new skills.
Of course, on the whole, I spent about five times as much time on the course, but from about 2-3 weeks, using the advice I received, the training skills and habits I received allowed me to take tests the first time and with high scores."

This course was something I looked forward to each day this summer.  Dr. Oakley's calming voice and all the research done by her and Terrance was thorough and simplified (compact).  I feel that I can apply so many concepts into my job, my health (procrastination), my dreams to accomplish many more academic feats in my lifetime.  Many thanks for the post-lesson cue, ""I'm Babara Oakley, thanks for learning how to learn""  Best, HT"

I am interested in ""learning and motivation"", And this course has good bibliography about it. I agree with Schopenhauer idea that Motives are the causes views from within us."
2022-03-19 00:00:00,Jan U,5.0,0.0,"I have learned a lot how to keep my attention when I am learning. The different ways to learn and how to make a break time during the process for after this I can get back to the learning path again.
The Pomodoro Technique is a success, I would like to say that If I hadn´t the time to keep 25 minutes I wouldn´t have failed completely, no never think that, if not that you can start with less time to practice and make the habit."
2020-12-11 00:00:00,DIMITRIOS Z,5.0,0.0,"This courses helped me to understand many problems in classroom . Defines properly the conceptual map of educacional problems and notify the tools to avoid them. As for me the best thing that happened is that i gave a name to the facts that made me a bad student.Now i have bigger motivation and passion too ,to help my students to avoid my mistakes.

I wish i would've found this course years before.
Still i think material learned during this previous weeks will strongly help me for future endeavours.
It's amazing to learn all  this kind of subjects based on scientific background and taught by really smart people.
Thanks you so much, Barbara and Terrance."
2019-01-27 00:00:00,Blair K,5.0,0.0,"Many thanks to the instructors and university for making this course available.  It pointed out some of the flaws and limitations in my learning methods.  More importantly, it gave me a road map to improving my learning and long-term comprehension of subjects.  I am already using my new developing skills to improve reading comprehension, learning newer complex materials, and being generally more efficient in work and learning."
2018-01-27 00:00:00,Rhys J,5.0,0.0,"This course was fantastic. I wish I was aware of all these hints and tips many years ago, however, glad to have been taught these now. Barbara and Terry thank you, as you have provided so many valuable tools to be able to learn more efficiently and understand those tougher concepts. You will change many peoples lives with your courses, most likely you have done so already. I look forward to your books and the following courses "
2017-12-26 00:00:00,Georgia J,5.0,0.0,"Great course! After completing a three-course MOOC certificate earlier this year, I realized I needed help studying and retaining information. I learned about this course via The Odin Project, signed up the same day, and completed it within two weeks. I find the presentations, techniques, recommendations, and optional videos very helpful. I'm using the techniques to learn CSS and HTML. I appreciate it being available for free.

2017-11-20 00:00:00,Ram S,5.0,0.0,"Truly outstanding and eye opening course.   It has been a couple of months now...and am thinking about going through the material once again (to Chunk all the good stuff I was exposed to in the course).
Have shared the course to my Senior Management.  While they are all good people I think many of have forgotten the joy and art of learning.  I really believe it will be good exposure for them to go through the course themselves.   "

In Summer 2016, I will complete all of the classes for a BS degree,  all but two math classes.  After completing Learning How to Learn, I am confident that, while math may be a challenge, it is a challenge I will overcome.
Thank you for sharing these learning tools with the rest of us!"
2015-11-20 00:00:00,Johnathan C,5.0,0.0,"Wow. This course is great. After just the first couple of videos my brain starting working on how to approach other areas of study differently--much more efficiently. The spacing of material is something I had already know, but the reaffirmation of having to push through has been cemented in my mind. And now I know that that is precisely learning... it entails some degree of being uncomfortable. Thanks. Keep the goods rolling. "
2021-12-03 00:00:00,Рыбакова А Н,5.0,0.0,"one of the courses I think should be obligatory for anyone who is in their studies (colleges, universities, schools, individual studies). the materials are all in simple language, the process is built by their own recommendation of the best memorizing techniques, and it works! more than a year later I still remember the important points I can use for myself and recommend to other people (which I always do). thank you so much!"
2021-10-10 00:00:00,Rich S,5.0,0.0,"Great course and highly recommended!
Really well constructed modules and engaging hosts / content, with a healthy dose of joviality throughout the material helping to learn the concepts quickly.
Ideas were presented well, with complex concepts broken down very effectively. Clear commitment from the hosts in covering a lot of bases, as underlined in a vast array of additional (optional) materials and references to other sources."
2020-05-28 00:00:00,Matheus c g,5.0,0.0,"By far the best course I did in my entire life ! I learned how to deal with a big range of problems that in one way or another everyone deal with. It doesn't matter If you are doing great in school or college or you are flunking, you will learn something new from this course. I found incredible how effective the techniques presented here work and why anybody never told me this techniques before. 5/5 recommended for everyone !"
2020-04-25 00:00:00,Ahmed A,5.0,0.0,An essential course for all ages and disciplines. Truly beneficial to anyone learning any thing throughout his/her whole life. It includes how the brain works and how to use it efficiently; how to be productive and how to avoid procrastination; how to concentrate and how to memorize; and most importantly some tools and techniques. What is also worth noting is the concise and direct instructors. I highly recommend this course.

i wish i could had all this info 30 and more years ago, indeed my past study methods are full of this error (and i really am surprised i have some sort of success... too bad i can't go back in time, but i will try to be better in any study i will do!) thanks a lot to teachers, clear and perfect english speaking (i'm italian and had no problem in understanding their speech.)
i suggest to do this course to all i could.
 "
2017-06-20 00:00:00,Luv S,5.0,0.0,"
For full-time students and lifelong learners, this is the perfect course to add powerful tools to imporve deep learning. Being an experienced meditator, I could easily relate with the concepts of alternating focused mode and diffused mode learning. These are the very same concepts we use in the monastery. Eg: Timing your walks and sits (for instance 20min Walking meditation and 20 min Sit) and follow it by a 15 mins of break. "
2017-06-18 00:00:00,Don T,5.0,0.0,"This course will help you develop a strong sense of how you learn. It will teach you about the neurological mechanisms of memory and skill development, as well as give you some critical strategies, tools, and tips so that you can take control of how you learn. Barbara and Terrence are fantastic professors and this was an awesome course that has changed the way I look at my own education, both within the classroom and outside!"
2022-03-13 00:00:00,张世刚,5.0,0.0,"very good material to study learn how to learn. maybe I will study this course once more, using the skills which I learned from this course.
Actually, I have already been using a lot of skills, like Anki, Supermemo, Mind Map. But I thought still have too many aspects to enhance. And what I have learned from this course will help me a lot to study new things, especially while memories will loss as we getting older.
tks the team"
2020-10-02 00:00:00,Carlos G O,5.0,0.0,"It is a very informative and entertaining course, where every lesson you get great advice for truly learning things more effectively. I have heard about the pomodoro technique before but combined with the more scientific (and fun) explanations i was convinced to try it out, and i think that is the best part about this course, and it is that I finish motivated to keep applying the tips and tricks learned here. Thanks a lot :) "
2020-06-12 00:00:00,Karem S f m,5.0,0.0,"This course simply i consider one of the most powerful courses i have ever taken, also I have gotten enormous information out of this and this what i am planning to apply in my new life career. Finnaly the new skills i have learned are unforgetable and so ease to grasp and apply. One last thing learning how to learn wasn't only a course for me it was a part of mine now. Thank you drs for your efforts through the whole course "
2019-08-13 00:00:00,KR S,5.0,0.0,"This course really helped me to figure out how to learn.  I wanted to learn things in the past, start a course but drop interest halfway through. I wish I came across this course at least a decade back. Never the less I have a lot more to learn. Now I know how to learn effectively without dropping the interest. Thank you so much, Professor Barbara Oakley. They way she explained was amazing. I wish I meet here in my lifetime.  "
2020-04-23 00:00:00,Rachel R,5.0,0.0,"The course comprehensively covered the main areas of how to learn, in an interesting, easy to understand way. The videos retained your interest and the content was both interesting but extremely helpful. The instructors are fantastic and the optional reading and information contains a significant amount of information, which I would definitely recommend accessing. Overall, a fantastic course that I would strongly recommend."
2017-07-11 00:00:00,yifan,5.0,0.0,"overall this course is brilliant as the content is very well structured and clearly explained. I really like how most how the concepts are explained through graphics and metaphors, and i feel close to the two teachers. 
one thing I would like to point out is that the last part of the 4th week learning is not exciting as the first three weeks as it's very focused the practical tips for tests, which I am already familiar with.  "
2021-09-08 00:00:00,Joel P,5.0,0.0,"I am not going to say that I am a procrastinate person, but what I am doing as a job is very tiring and prevent me to focus or doing things on time. This course ""learning how to learn"" has thought me how to mange the study time and how to reduce stress when I study.  The break time in between, the repetition to help you memorize and how to schedule your time, all these tips help me so far a lot to focus better on my study."
2020-05-28 00:00:00,Steven H G A,5.0,0.0,"I believe that this course has given me a better understanding of how my brain works, and how can I make the most out of it. This course also pointed out the harmful habit I do during studying and learning, how can I avoid these harmful habits and replace them with beneficial ones. I will start applying all the the techniques I learned during this course to enhance my learning experience and change my life to a better one."
2020-04-19 00:00:00,Yolanda P J,5.0,0.0,"What Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski, the educators, have done is breathtaking. This course gives such a great insight into how the brain works and how to overcome obstacles or illusions and therefore think more effectively, it is awesome. The only detail to improve is the subtitles, I was using Spanish subtitles and sometimes they were incomprehensible, not to mention that they were not in alignment with the speech."
2020-01-27 00:00:00,Youbeen S,5.0,0.0,"Fantastic class. A lot of materials could be considered common knowledge or basic, but the course was very upfront about that. I fact, I believe that it was necessary in order to cater to a wide range of audiences and to benefit as many people as possible. While I didn't find the course to be challenging, I did take away a couple tools and tricks that will continue to benefit me throughout the lifelong journey of learning."
2019-02-10 00:00:00,Sripooja M,5.0,0.0,This is a wonderful course for any person who is interested in learning how to learn effectively. I highly appreciate the LHTL team's efforts to design the course content in such a way that person from any discipline is able to understand the concepts easily. In one word this was an awesome beginning to the effective learning journey. A big thank you to LHTL team! I am definitely going to share this course with my friends.
2017-09-23 00:00:00,Elena G,5.0,0.0,"A brilliant course, i should complete it way earlier! The learning tips are so useful, it seems to me i'm automatically applying some of them already. Trying to implement mind maps for everything like presentation for work, a book presentation meeting etc, found this tool to be very useful. After making a mind map i can easily recall the whole speech or idea behind it! Still need to inhabit the chapter 4 tips into my life."
2021-07-13 00:00:00,Gabriel A,5.0,0.0,"Whether it is for a Degree/Certification, Training, professional or studying; this is the best approach to understand and gives you the best tools for understanding and comprehending any topic.  I highly recommend it!

Great explanations with solid graphics and the right energy make this a valuable course. It helps me with my own learning and also when teaching others. This is good to anyone, but it would be especially helpful for university students who want to do better, who already have the drive, but are lacking some valuable tools."

Excelentemente explicado, todos los detalles, si me costo un poco por no estar completamente en Español, pero con lo que se de ingles me enseño muchisimas cosas..  si tengo tiempo en un futuro tomare el que están traduciendo al Espa{ol, por si se me paso algo.. pero si, este curso me ayudara en mi privado de la universidad, en organizar y ser mas efectivo en el trabajo, y si quiero estudiar nuevas cosas."
2016-02-09 00:00:00,Robyn J,5.0,0.0,My company decided to move everyone around and I was placed in an environment where I had to learn a new field. It's been a long time since I was in school and the learning process was not going well. I saw this course course and figured maybe there's something I've forgotten or never learned about learning. There is a lot I never understood about learning! I encourage others to take this course and find out for yourself.
2019-08-23 00:00:00,Ericka L P,5.0,0.0,"Highly informative, fun, and engaging for a course that's very meta -- Professors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski present the subject matter in a way that anyone can easily relate, whether they came from a science or an arts/humanities course. It has since inspired us to reflect on our current study habits and look at where we can start changing for the better.
Thank you for teaching us about learning how to learn!!"
2018-01-05 00:00:00,Sara E,5.0,0.0,"Barbara Oakley shows you how you can go from studying zero to studying hero, and deeply learn complex concepts that you never thought you had a shot at truly knowing. She lays out concrete, easy to follow steps that you can do to help understanding and memory, while also developing skills to fight and eventually eliminate procrastination. I found her inspirational! Thank you Barbara, for creating such an amazing  course!"
2017-02-24 00:00:00,Claudia A,5.0,0.0,"
Great tools and scientific explanations that help us understand how our brain works, why we procrastinate and how to learn more efficiently. You start having a more rational attitude towards your learning process, which helps move forward and get it done easier than before! You can definitely get rid of bad old habits and start creating new more healthy ones. Very helpful for anybody, life is a constant learning journey!"
2016-08-07 00:00:00,Claudia T,5.0,0.0,"This course introduced many important concepts and tools like ""focus mode vs diffuse mode of thinking"", ""chunking"",""illusion of competence""..etc. It may be the very basic knowledge about mental function, neurons, and some sort of neuroscience, but it's like a gate opens a new world for you to know your self learning mode and help you in some extend to more focus on the points that needs to be improved. Very great course!"
2015-08-14 00:00:00,Anderson Z,5.0,0.0,"Ótimo curso, nos dá conceitos importantes sobre como estudar, que efetivamente melhoram nosso aprendizado. Uma boa dica para aqueles que querem começar é assistir esse curso com a seguinte pergunta em mente ""como eu devo estudar para melhorar meu rendimento"". Ao final, aprenderão muito sobre as técnicas, e verão que é possível aplicar em vários tipos de matérias - desde matemática, programação, artes marciais, dança etc."
2015-08-14 00:00:00,Shirley B,5.0,0.0,Learning how to learn has never been easier and more fun! This course is an invaluable aid to learn ANYTHING. It provides 'know-how' and confidence in your ability to master any subject matter. The techniques provided to deal with procrastination have significantly impacted my life. I am grateful to Coursera and to instructors Terrence Sejnowsi and especially Barbara Oakley for making learning such a pleasure. Thank you!
2020-07-02 00:00:00,Ravindra B K V B,5.0,0.0,"The course has provided valuable insights into the cognitive processes of learning.  As a teacher, I agree that all the information given in the course is true to my experience.   This helps me to understand my learners better and to guide them well while dealing with complex topics in their learning. I suggest every parent, child and teacher must aware of this information while dealing with children and their learning. "
2020-05-26 00:00:00,Sergio I S E,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course that teaches not only how to learn but how to work and make the best of the energy and time we put into our endeavours. The teacher´s very honest and slow passed approach turns out to be very relaxing and enjoyable, to the contrary of most of the modern high passed youtube videos and tutorials out there. Very recommended for EVERYONE looking to learn about the brain and how to make the best of it."
2019-01-07 00:00:00,LUCIANA M A,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course! Full of useful and sound recommendations. Based on real science. I'm planning on applying it to my teaching and to the several subjects I'm constantly learning. I personally don't like the several mentions to zombies and alike, for a couple of times it made me question if the course was for teenagers (I'm 40 yo!). But the information is very well presented and valuable, I would definitely recommend. "
2017-10-22 00:00:00,Angelo P,5.0,0.0,"This is an amazing course and will help all in their pursuit of higher learning, It teaches techniques that are are both practical and easy to implement such as the focused and diffused modes, the use of metaphors and analogy in learning, the importance of rest and repetition (a little bit every day to learn and grow) achieving mastery in your subject area plus overcoming procrastination with the Pomodoro technique etc. "
2016-01-25 00:00:00,Reagan C,5.0,0.0,"Barbara is a fun professor to listen to. The jokes and analogies can be terribly cheesy but they are memorable! I wish I had taken this course years before starting univeristy studies. It explains how the brain works to process, learn, and memorize information and gives practical tips anyone can implement when trying to learn new material. This is a valuable course that has already enhanced my learning over the 4 weeks."
2022-05-11 00:00:00,Chloe W,5.0,0.0,"I expected this to be another cringy middle-school-esque lesson on how to highlight properly and reread information but I was pleasantly surprised to be immersed in a science-based, highly effective course that actually kept my ADHD brain intrigued and invested. The skills you learn here are fact-based,  proven methodologies from wo very reliable and fun-to-watch individuals and I would recommend this course to anyone."
2020-08-20 00:00:00,Francisco D,5.0,0.0,I found this course interesting and wish it would have been available when I was in college the first time or even high school. What I enjoyed the most was how learning concepts that I’ve come across through my adult life have been gathered up and organized in easy to follow presentations. I think this material is so important that I’ve asked my teenage daughter entering high school this fall to go through this course. 
2020-05-24 00:00:00,Juan G,5.0,0.0,"This was a great course! I followed three years ago, and it is great because it provides not only techniques (this is great!)   to improve your learning process  but, also, the  background/basis for these techniques, and the scientific evidence for this background, as well. This means that it provides you with powerful tools to improve your learning process on your own, (and, in my case, my students' learning process)."
2020-04-01 00:00:00,Adrianto R,5.0,0.0,"It's so helpful for me because now, I can learn how to improve myself and how to learn new skills effectively.

I learn so many things and I will recommend many people to take this course. Thank you, Mrs Barbara and Mr Sejnowski. "
2019-08-07 00:00:00,Floriano G P,5.0,0.0,"This course confirm some point of view that I already had and show me new scientific informations and methods  to study, memorize and prepare to tests. The interviews are interesting too because enphasize some concepts and aggregate some particular way to lead with circunstances.

2018-03-14 00:00:00,Tran T S,5.0,0.0,"Though I am a master student, I must say this course helps me much in understanding not only how to study but also myself.

Moreover, there are lots of additional articles that worth the effort of expanding your understanding about learning approaches. This is a must take course for those seeking the knowledge."
2017-01-16 00:00:00,Giorgio S,5.0,0.0,"Highly recommend this very useful course. Done accelerated learning techniques in the past but as it turns out these can often create ilusions of competence.

Happy learning! :-) "

I purchased the optional book, and found that reading it after completing the lectures helped to solidify the concepts learned during lectures. Barbara and Terry put together an excellent program.

Dr Barbara Oaklay and Dr. Terry Sejnowisky are amazing teachers who really know their stuff very well. especially, the interviews of real world heroes and heroines of learning is really motivating. after completing this course, I feel that I am ready to learn new languages and scientific concepts outside of my field of expertise.

I would recommend every student to take this course . "

2018-01-15 00:00:00,Ram R,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course - I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning especially people who believe that they CANNOT learn certain things AFTER a certain age. I am deeply grateful to the two very knowledgeable and learned instructors for the confidence instilled in me for learning newer things effectively. 
What one learns with pleasure, one never forgets. This course pretty much satisfies that criterion."
2015-10-11 00:00:00,Flavio A Q D,5.0,0.0,"This course is a must. It explains a lot of key concepts that prove essential for anyone who wants to be a more efficient learner on any subject.

The various topics are presented in a fun and easy way. And in case you don't get it just rewind the video or look for help on the discussion boards.
Another plus are the various interviews with people sharing experiences and difficulties on their specific areas of knowledge."
2015-08-27 00:00:00,Jennifer Z,5.0,0.0,"Brilliant! It may sounds overenthusiastic, but this course enriched my life dramatically. I've got a completely new perspective on how to learn. Even only two weeks after passing the final test and finishing this course I can avouch my learning process has improved up to a new level, both in terms of effectivity and efficiency.
Bottom Line: It doesn't matter who you are or what you are specializing in - do this course!"

2021-11-09 00:00:00,Fredericka S B,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course to take. Why? Leaning How to Learn will not only teach you how you should learn but why the way you have been learning may have been counterproductive in learning effectively.  There are a lot of techniques backed by researched data proven to help you become a better learner, a better thinker and a better student over all. Trust me and check it out for yourself and you will not be disappointed."

It made me feel like learning more. Maybe about positive psychology, neuroscience, constructivism or even mental disorders. Let's see!"

Es hat mir die Kraft gegeben, wieder an mich zu glauben und weiter zu lernen, etwas was ich meinem ganzen Leben über mache und liebe. Mrs Oakley ist eine ruhige Kraft, hat mich, mit ihrer beruhigende Stimme, unheimlich motiviert und durch ihre klare Stimme und langsames Sprechen, auch mit meine Englischkenntnise weitergeholfen.

It's a shame that a course like this is not mandatory. Dr. Oakley is a PHENOMENAL educator whose teaching style is unparalleled. This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, course that I've ever taken. Do yourself a favor and at least try it because you'll be pleasantly surprised. "
2017-08-03 00:00:00,Francesco D G,5.0,0.0,"Very informative. It covers the main aspects of learning and, best of all it's backed by scientific researches that actually alllow to better understand all your behaviours when talking about learning a new thing. Because that is what they teach you, how to familiarize, learn and master any skill. It's also great for ESL students as the course is presented is a clear manner and with subtitles in different languages. "

All the same, not only did I receive a 21st century, evidence-based upgrade to my knowledge of learning theory, but I witnessed first-hand how to design and deliver a ""sticky MOOC."" Thanks, L2L!"
2017-06-25 00:00:00,Pugnat,5.0,0.0,"An excellent course on Learning.  I have enjoyed all the materials introduced here; it's original, well presented and explained clearly.  You can see from the way that they have designed the course that they apply what they preach; for example regular, mini-practice tests placed along the way before the actual quizzes to help us master the material in hand.  And it works as you can feel that you are making progress."
2017-05-30 00:00:00,Lise P,5.0,0.0,"
An amazing course which can be seen as a helpful tool to better learning from any subject and from life in general, as a coching session helping you to organise your learning and at the same time your daily work or tasks and a motivational course which makes you understand that (learning) everything is possible. It changed my way to think and to welcome my new tasks or learning sessions with motivation and patience."
2016-12-12 00:00:00,Natalie M,5.0,0.0,"I wholeheartedly loved this course! Which I think...says a lot. I feel I got way more out of this course, in terms of applicable life tools, than I even thought when I initially signed up. Understanding what is going on in my brain, throughout the learning process, is a valuable tool that will support me while learning something new! The team who put this course together did a fantastic job! I loved it. Thank you!!!"
2015-10-08 00:00:00,Rafael C,5.0,0.0,"This course has exceeded my expectations. I learnt very useful tools to improve my learning and have a strong state of mind avoiding learning hindrances.

I have also been able to remove procrastination from my daily tasks which was a hindrance to progress in learning and lifestyle. I feel more confident in my skills and abilities and look forward to learning more things and enjoy the process of learning. Highly recommended.
2020-01-22 00:00:00,Heather R,5.0,0.0,"This course was beneficial and helped me as I work on the second part of my career, which will require intense learning of new skill sets and the ability to tackle my procrastination habit.
This course was beneficial with tips and providing an understanding of why we do the things we do — dating back to habits formed in early school days. 
Thank you for the clarity and confidence now to chase my future career dreams."
2018-10-01 00:00:00,Stuart K,5.0,0.0,"Really useful, it is great to get some insights into how our brains work when we study. Some of the stuff seems obvious, but I found that I did not really understand why things work or do not work. Now I do and it is interesting, I have found myself being able to actually give advice to people studying, which is something I would have been reluctant to try before the course! I recommend this course, please take it."
2018-01-14 00:00:00,Zahra,5.0,0.0,"Marked increase in both productivity and ability to learn effectively after the first two weeks of this course. Given easy to implement ways to learn and focus more readily - useful for study as well as general productivity (any task that requires time and focus - could be a skill or project). Extremely helpful, will likely annoy all my friends and family by constantly sharing what I've learned. Highly recommended!"
2016-01-31 00:00:00,Artturi Y,5.0,0.0,"
Thank you so much! LhtL is an excellent course. It changed the way I study and learn, and the way I think about studying and learning. Not only did it provide new information (I suppose most of us students knew a lot of the things taught, such as ""you should study the material during a longer period of time - not just the last night""), but it helps in actually implementing those things in every day life. 
Thank you!"
2015-10-27 00:00:00,Harry L,5.0,0.0,"Recommended for everyone. As a retiree, a lifetime learner, and graduate school drop out I have done a lot of learning. Some, like the incidental learning that happens when surfing Wikipedia, has been pleasant. Some, especially in an academic or work setting has been painfully frustrating. This course has been very helpful in showing me how to make learning pleasant and effective as opposed to hard and frustrating."
2015-08-08 00:00:00,Ko,5.0,0.0,"I am very happy that I completed this module! There are few teachers who taught about how to learn and how our brain is actually doing while we are learning new stuff. By knowing more about the activities happening in the brain helps me to control my learning, and sometime, use some tricks to convince my brain go deeper, or to train my brain.
I can't wait to apply the methods taught in this module on other subjects!"
2021-06-03 00:00:00,Laura M,5.0,0.0,"This course is absolutely brilliant! It offers lots of practical tips on how to learn better and makes you want to start learning something new as soon as you're done watching the videos. I also very much appreciated the great clarity with which the more complex concepts are explained. Finally, I loved the quirky, a bit old-fashioned graphics of the videos. And the teachers are just great! I can only recommend it."
2021-04-04 00:00:00,Ryan L,5.0,0.0,"The course has reinforced many of the concepts and methods I have used to learn - I didn't realize that I was using these concepts.  
The importance of sleep and exercise in learning was an eye opener.  
Very useful ideas about avoiding procrastination especially dealing with the cues and rewards part.
Lots of interesting concepts about using group learning sessions to improve understanding and mastery over subjects."
2020-10-03 00:00:00,Bea L,5.0,0.0,"This is a very awesome course! I studied hard and got high grades when I was in college but found myself struggling to recall the concepts or apply them in the real world. Now that I am trying to un-learn and re-learn, I have found the lessons here particularly useful not just because of the tips but also from the realizations of the mistakes that I did in the past. Kudos to everyone who made this course possible! "
2020-07-03 00:00:00,Eman F,5.0,0.0,I've never been happier after taking a course as I am now.. this short course is one of the best things anyone can get out of a MOOC plus it gives you tricks that are helpful to people in every stage of their life. inspirational interviews with experts in different fields and timely quizzes embed the information into your brain. I recommend this to all especially students who are thinking of taking courses online.

2020-04-10 00:00:00,Shaheer A,5.0,0.0,"  I just finished this course and I feel this knowledge should be mandatorily taught in schools to help students learn more efficiently. After all, students spend a lot of years studying every day. Making this extensive process more efficient, by use of such courses, would save a lot of time and energy, and produce better results.I genuinely think this can make a significant difference for a lot of people out there.  "
2020-08-15 00:00:00,Saber B,5.0,0.0,"So I just finished the
course  and
I can say that it has actually changed the way I perceive my studies. I
strongly recommend it to anyone willing to put some efforts to change the way
you learn.

tired of all the click-bait rubbish that surrounds the productivity articles
and advices you will find on the internet, then this is the course for you, and
it is the last course you need."

As a health care professional,  I wish I had taken this course before any of my formal education, but it was still incredibly helpful in breaking my procrastination habit and in learning how to be more effective in my learning and time management.

It is an interesting subject, they explain in easy ways and overall, this is quite important through life (knowing how to learn can do many good things to you, and save many time!) Also, it's noticeable the love and passion they have put in this course, and they really care and try to pass many important aspects of good habits, some philosophy and even a little neuroscience."
2020-05-07 00:00:00,CJ C,5.0,0.0,"Every video is well explained and having lots of scientific research to guideline us in Learning How to Learn.

2020-03-21 00:00:00,Victoria B,5.0,0.0,"It's such a pleasing course. It's like a good friend, to whom you can come and chill out, relax. Literally, every chunk of information will be useful, tests only help you to remember better and moreover it's explained why! You won't be immersed deeply in dark shadows of scientific terms.

2015-09-05 00:00:00,Mickey F,5.0,0.0,"The course practices what it preaches using several short video lectures that are cheesy in many ways, but memorable nonetheless. Tests feel like a recall tool used to further learning rather than some sort of unsurmountable challenge.  Overall, because of the wisely broken down lecture clips, the quality of the material given, and the practicality and applicability to almost anyone, I gave this course 5 stars."
2022-07-06 00:00:00,Maryana R,5.0,0.0,"This course made me  realize  how  ""easy""  is to learn. You can learn everything you want, just by using  the tools  given.  Obviously, practice makes perfect, but  these  are  ways that can allow us  to get better with  time.  There is no natural passion or dift,  we  can master all kinds of subjects.

"
2020-05-11 00:00:00,Layla H,5.0,0.0,"Before, I have not thought about learning from the point of view in the course, people around us usually demand good results and hope us to do our bests during life. We usually try to learn materials, languages, arts, or even sports, but we often forget that learning itself is something we need to learn in order to give our bests at any approach.
It was a great course to start with, I recommend it for everyone."
2017-06-05 00:00:00,Dennis,5.0,0.0,"
I really enjoyed this class and wish they had other classes available and some sort of work book to practice techniques and chunking. If I would have learned this in grade school or college I would have attained and retained so much more along my education journey. A journey that should never end. One other thing, I would have attempted to attack some subjects that scared me if I had these tools in my arsenal."

I think it should be called Learning How to Learn Better. Nevertheless, it is an amazing course - it helped me understand a lot of things that I intuitively knew as a teacher and a student. It also gives helpful techniques to tackle procrastination - something I am afflicted with from time to time.

I was telling my 17 year old son, Boris, just the other day, this month, that we should've been taught how to learn, before being sent off to school ! Or at least gradually taught how to learn ... I remember one person told me, during my quest, that: ...""you learn how  to learn by yourself, as you advance in your studies..."" Wrong !"

Everyone can benefit from this course, but those who've struggled with school or a particular topic will benefit the most. To obtain the most benefit from this course, get the accompanying text book (I got the kindle version) and also review the additional readings and videos at the end of each week. "

This is actually my first ever online course, this course has been worth every second. ""Learning how to learn""has given me new and profound perspective towards learning, I only wish I had started this course four years earlier, it would have made all the difference. I recommend everyone to take this course, it has offered me so much. "

I am eager to try this in a village school, where I spend some time during the school hours. I am grateful to Coursera.Deeply love theway Barbara Oakly and Dr. Terrence conduct talk. I am pleased that such a wonderful course on Learning is available for free on line. Grateful.  C G nagaraja."

Delivered well in short chunks with short quiz's on the way to help you digest and remember what you have learnt.
It doesn't take a large commitment in terms of time to complete the course so click 'yes' and join up.
This is the 1st mooc I've done and look forward to doing more."

Exercise being so important for learning was an eye opener. its going to be part of my daily schedule to have some form of exercise.
Thank You Very much for such a wonderful experience and loads of learning about how to learn!! "

I'd highly reccomend the course whether your are at high school or Phd student. It can be used for parents wiling to help their kids as well. It's a course based on what is the most modern research in neuroscience and learning process.
2017-12-17 00:00:00,Rocio R,5.0,0.0,"The skills taught in this class are magnificent. However, it is the small one line sentences, the advice, the feeling that others are also in the same boat, that really encouraged me to continue. I like this class not just because it taught me valuable skills to apply to my learning, but also to realize that perseverance and determination are really the key to success. This course reminded me of just that. "
2016-11-22 00:00:00,Keivan T,5.0,0.0,"I'm grateful that I have bumped into this course. The ideas delivered are life changing. So little attention is paid to HOW WE LEARN, though we love to celebrate the good students and chastise the 'bad' ones. This set of ideas which could be described as a primer in neuroscience, and a set of techniques that make you learn more efficiently and joyfully, SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. What are we waiting for? "
2016-10-06 00:00:00,Errin E,5.0,0.0,"
Very interesting subject matter presented in a memorable way. The course was really helpful in understanding how to retain information and be more deliberate about learning. It also provided good tips for combatting procrastination, not tricking myself into thinking I am learning, and not getting ""stuck"" in the same old ways of thinking. The professors are quirky, but it works well with the subject matter. "
2015-10-12 00:00:00,Litha G,5.0,0.0,"This course has really helped me not about learning how to learn but also how to deal with procrastination and to use the diffuse mode of thinking in solving problems in other areas of my life. A brilliant course indeed.  Although not compulsory, the book by Barbara Oakley called A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra) is a good companion material for this course.

2019-10-26 00:00:00,Meadhbh H,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed this course. It was well paced and the material was repeated just often enough to sink in, but not so often that it became dull. I like that the course designers supported assertions about learning techniques with modern neuro-biology research and am still reading the references. It was short enough that it was easy to complete, but ""full"" enough that I felt there was value in taking the course."
2019-05-31 00:00:00,Aniruddh M,5.0,0.0,"Recommended for anyone looking forward to improvise in any aspect, it's the most basic thing that everyone must be aware of. Personally, it made me realize the flaws in learning methods/habits ,that were committed, me not being aware of 'em all the time! In simpler terms, some things are realized only when someone else points them out for ya, it's amazing how 'science' could do all of it! 
Love Science(+1)"

I tried to communicate and there is no telephone nor contact to claim. I checked on the web and several people had gone through the same thing so im never paying again. Maybe you could help to improve this with coursera. 
Nevertheless I loved your course. thankyou. "

Professor makes us easy to sail through the topic at the same time your interest for the course increases over time.

I recommend this course to everyone and would rate the highest point available in the rating scale."

Nevertheless I  was expecting exercises to apply and test the suggested techniques, especially techniques such as the mental palace. I have found very interesting the impostor syndrome, maybe because I was/am affected by that. It is very important to speak about it, so that it is easier for people to ""heal"" from that.  "

After being rewarded with my certificate I find my self esteem and my confidence soaring! Speaker speaks slowly and very clearly so that understanding along with scripts is very easy to follow. Using the skills learned in this course I want to apply it to another field of learning and see myself challenge higher.

Revealing that the topics that the course is about is not the absolute right and it may not work would make me much comfortable"

It's presented in a manner that allowed me to quickly grasp many new concepts and ideas which isn't usually the case for me.

The fully ""Open"" nature of the course enhanced the effectiveness of the course.
This course, has reinforced for me, the truism that you are never too old learn. It discredited the other truism that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. At least not when I was the ""old dog"".
Should you take my recommendation, it is my wish for you to take away as much as I have."
2016-11-28 00:00:00,Leila B,5.0,0.0,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.  I was disappointed that there was not more participation in the forums from other classmates.  I found Dr. Oakley's methods of teaching very creative and assisting in the learning process.  The testing did indeed help my learning as it showed where I was wrong and gave me the opportunity to correct it.   The outside reading was also helpful in understanding the material.

Barbara reveals the power of knowledge tools in such an easy manner! Somehow it simply grows and yields it's fruits in your mind.

It doesn't just teach techniques on effective learning but also explains how our mind works and how we process information. through this, we can understand ourselves and can think of which is more effective to us. It highlights things that we should avoid and the benefits of things that =can help to improve our mind. Understanding how our mind works gives confidence and takes our envy away fro geniuses."

I strongly recommend taking this course.

clear view of the work organization and learning strategies. You do not need to
think about maths or science for taking advantage of it. The different
strategies to cope with procrastination and frustration are highly useful for

In my opinion, this should be taught at least in every university and high school for first-year students."

Once you implement all the learnings from this course, it is way easier to learn and grasp concepts of any field of your choice, great instructor Prof. Oakley. The exam tips section would be a real help. Thanks for the course."

When you get stuck in the middle or even in the beginning it becomes insistently difficult to carry on. With the help of this course one can really understand how not to give up and keep going on. I think that would be the greatest take away for me from this course.

I recommend to anyone who wants to be a better, more efficient learner. It can change your life."
2016-02-20 00:00:00,Chelsie S B,5.0,0.0,Amazing! I'd be so much further if schools would require this course early on in education. Incourperating lessons from this course in early education or even as a whole would be benificial in standardized testing and students progression in overall learning. I loved this course now I'm looking foward to learning so much more. Thank you and everyone who made this course available to people like me.
2016-02-15 00:00:00,Pierre A,5.0,0.0,"I just don't understand why this is not teached in school. 
Some of this you might have figured out but this course will enable you to plan in a systematic way how you study and remember what you study. Very insightful on the study proccess. I am glad this is the first course I took on Coursera, it will help me so much with the other courses I intend to attend.
Thanks again for providing this course!"
2015-12-28 00:00:00,Ibrah Z,5.0,0.0,"That was my first online course and i have really enjoyed so much and gained a lot of precious ideas and concepts about different aspects of learning, My professor has shared it with my classmates and me, and i knew it won't be such a waste of time, I want to thank so much everyone who has contributed by any kind of help to create this course, especially Dr Barbara Oakley and Dr Terrence Sejnowski. "
2021-03-13 00:00:00,Maggie W,5.0,0.0,"Great course - if only I knew many years ago, what I know now.
This course makes you believe in yourself; you can do it!  It may take a little adjusting to how you approach your project
and/or study, but you get the HOWs and WHYs step by step.
Both Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski are excellent, they
guide through the course in a very upbeat and energetic manner.
The start of new beginnings for me."

I learn a lot of things that i didn't realize before that i could do better and thinking widely. Dr.Barbara & Dr.Terrace gave an easy, clear and simple explanation for each topic. So in the end we could understand and apply it in our daily life.  Thank you for open up my perspective to learn and my life"
2020-05-22 00:00:00,Lesley D,5.0,0.0,"I found this really helpful for myself and have been sharing what I'm learning with my teens. So much of this I have had to learn the hard way by trial and error, we really should know how our brains work to gather and store information in a useful way. This course addresses that. There are so many supportive resources added in that I have a wealth of study information to turn to. Thank you, team."
2020-05-17 00:00:00,JHON J C R,5.0,0.0,"This is a masterpiece of how to learn to learn. There isn't any other way to boost one's intelligence  rather than thinking of it. Our brain is a powerful machine which needs reprogramming over and over by learning new things, practicing  them will keep our long-term memory healthy. Finally, this course proves that you can regulate your own learning and be self-confident on everything you ship on."
2018-10-22 00:00:00,Troy N,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course.  I highly recommend this to help further your understanding of learning.  By the end of the course, you will look at thinking differently and question your thought processes in the future.  Specifically, they do focus on test taking at the end of the course, although this was a quick topic compared to the rest of the in-depth review of learning throughout the rest of the program."
2018-01-28 00:00:00,Gabrielle B,5.0,0.0,"One of the best courses I've ever taken in coursera!! ♥
The content is very applicable and easy to understand because the professor is EXCELLENT. I believe every student should take this course at least once. It did help me a lot and I am very excited to apply all the techniques on my own studies.
I am very greatful for you guys to have shared all this great information with me. Thank you so much :)"
2021-04-25 00:00:00,Sean M,5.0,0.0,"  A very accessible and insightful course, underpinned by quality research. The layout and structure of the course is excellent and makes it very easy to follow. The short video lessons allow for bite-size access on a regular basis, which is really good for some time-challenged people. I really enjoyed this course and many thanks to Dr Oakley and Dr Sejnowski for creating and presenting it so well.  "
2021-02-23 00:00:00,Renuka S L,5.0,0.0,"Very interesting course, it is useful for every learner, teaches lots of study techniques (Pomodoro, be in the process, etc) to be very efficient in your studies, tell us about our weakness (like Zombies and Procrastinations) and most importantly tells about importance of sleep and breaks between the studies. Thanks Barbara Oakley , Dr. Terrence Sejnowski and Coursera for such a wonderful course."
2020-10-15 00:00:00,Carmen M M,5.0,0.0,"Excellent program by Dr. Oakley and D. Sejnowski.   This program has been a mind opener for me at 70 years old in understanding my procrastinations and inabilities to focus whenever attempting to join any online programs. Thank you, thank you for this program. I have been recommending the program to every parent I meet so they can help their children with online studies during this pandemic year."
2020-08-02 00:00:00,María M,5.0,0.0,"Excelentes tips para dejar de tener miedo de aprender sobre cosas que se nos dificultan y aventurarnos a aprender sobre todo lo que nos interese y vayamos descubriendo a lo largo de nuestras vidas tanto personales como profesionales. Los videos dan analogías muy útiles y los tips son simples pero muy efectivos. Además, aprender (así sea un mínimo) sobre el funcionamiento del cerebro es increíble. "
2020-06-29 00:00:00,Filza F,5.0,0.0,"I encourage everyone to attend this course! The Professors do a wonderful job at explaining how neural networks and the brain's structure relate to techniques that we utilise in studying. You come across new techniques and perhaps a few we've known of before, but the difference lies in understanding why they or they don't don't work, which makes it convenient as a learner to improve how we study."
2020-05-28 00:00:00,Arman K E D,5.0,0.0,"As a newly graduated student  from college, I wished I learned these concepts and techniques when I was a freshman. It made me think that, learning how to learn, could have potentially helped me aced exams before when I was still a student. Alas, my time has passed, I recommend these to all future students who wished to feel that the education system is too focused on the product not the process."
2020-04-14 00:00:00,Ahmed s ,5.0,0.0,I found learning how to learn a very helpful course for improving your learning and how to learn with effective techniques to strengthen your knowledge and expertise in what you are studying or learning. it is like a instruction manual to how to learn. with very kind and helpful instructors who simplify  complicated  terms and concepts about human brain in a way everyone can grasp and understand. 
2020-01-19 00:00:00,Leila S,5.0,0.0,"The instructor is very calm, active, accurate and put some related interviews in some videos  in a very thoughtful way. All the time I come back for some reminding, found this course very motivated and helpful. As I love to learn new things, this course has pointed to the majority of knowledge we would have to know to be more successful in our education time.  Hope you enjoy and welcome to learn!"
2019-07-21 00:00:00,ER K H,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed Learning How To Learn as it provides a lot of useful insights on learning. These insights help me to be a better learner and a better teacher - as the last part of the course suggests that we should teach others about these techniques then we can confidently say that we have achieved full mastery. In so doing, we are also enriched by the learning and answers that our ""students"" give us. "
2018-02-10 00:00:00,Loveradge N,5.0,0.0,"refreshing to learn..how i can maximise my learning journey. its  been eye opening, inspiring and evoking the spirt of learning  and charting new areas of knowledge. i highly reccomend this course to anyone struggling with their studies and thos ethat seek to seppen how to learn anything in life

2017-08-16 00:00:00,Adrian H,5.0,0.0,"When I told my wife the title of the course she immediately did a double take, scoffed, and checked my face to see if I was joking.  Learning how to learn seems like a counter-productive skill to master, but it all makes PERFECT sense.  If you want to learn more, you should master the ART of learning so you can actually LEARN more.
This course is awesome and I could not recommend it highly enough!"
2016-07-08 00:00:00,Jorge A G D,5.0,0.0,"This course is awesome, I considered myself to be a good student, and during this course I learnt that I was a good student because I had discovered various techniques that are taught in this course, I didn't know I knew them and that they were the responsibles for my good grades. I also discovered new techniques that I didn't know, and with them I can now become an excellent student and learner."
2016-01-28 00:00:00,celina o,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course, both accessible and precise explanations of the psychology and neurology of learning, from very visual explanations at first to very detailed explanations later, with many concrete advice and examples of how to spend your learning time more efficiently, and many ressources to dig further into the recent underlying research papers. Should be taught mandatorily in all highschools."
2020-11-24 00:00:00,Irina S,5.0,0.0,"  Comprehensive study in functioning of the brain in the learning process told in a friendly and easy-to-grasp manner. The course is divided in small videos and contains a lot of useful tips to master learning. It has tests after each topic. One minus is that it's no really beautiful in design - I would really wish to see an appealing design and videos made more professionally, not like in the 90s  "
2020-06-04 00:00:00,Adriano F C,5.0,0.0,"This
course proved to be extremely valuable and insightful.  Some ideas I had been practicing since ever
(without being aware), but most of techniques and knowledge were new to
me.  Looking in retrospect, they make
total sense, since they fit in many life experiences, actually explaining some
outcomes (good and bad) that I had previously experienced over the years.
Highly recommend this course !"
2019-04-11 00:00:00,Дмитрий,5.0,0.0,"This course inspired me to take a more serious approach to my education. Now I know how to gain not just an understanding of given information, but knowledge and mastery of the material. I know how to remember something long-term, how to gain more skills by studying less, how to battle procrastination, how to handle stress and perform well on tests. Quite a useful course anyone can benefit from."
2017-06-19 00:00:00,Maria E S G,5.0,0.0,"This course is excellent! Dynamic yet focused. It teaches what it preaches without you even noticing.

Thank you to everyone involved."

2015-08-15 00:00:00,Alvis T,5.0,0.0,I really learn a lot through this videos. I had try to make myself a better learners right now and to go further on my interest of study. The way of thinking of process not a product really change my mind of learning something about quantity that I need to have but actually is based on what quality you have learn from something. Thanks for all the lecturers and the supported team on this course.
2021-08-12 00:00:00,Mike T,5.0,0.0,"I found this a great overview of the mistakes we often make when facing challenging subject matter. I procrastinated my way through school and did passably well, but in later years I've learned those bad habits have held me back beyond academics. I've learned, but not as well (and lastingly) as I could have. I'm optimistic the concepts of this course will help me improve and be well worth time."
2020-07-11 00:00:00,Andres A E S,5.0,0.0,"Since the moment I selected this course I knew I needed it, I just hoped it was good. I wasn't disappointed. Learning How to Learn is a powerful tool which I will use a lot since I've been struggling for a while in my studies. I strongly recommend it if you feel like your studies aren't giving you the results you'd hope and in a sense you know you could do better, but you don't know how. 10/10."
2020-06-26 00:00:00,Sahil B,5.0,0.0,"This Course taught by Miss Barbara Oakley had a deep and enriching impact on my personality and attitude towards learning.

2022-04-11 00:00:00,Magdy D,5.0,0.0,"it was one of the most eye-opening courses that I've taken, I'm always struggling to memorize loads of information, but this course taught me to trust myself & the process & just keep pushing & ""GIVE MYSELF TIME"" to allow the information to be absorbed (which is the opposite of what we learned in schools/universities, unfortunately) which was the most critical thing I've taken from this course"
2022-01-13 00:00:00,Thịnh H H,5.0,0.0,"This is my first time studying on Coursera, and I'm a bit unfamiliar and skeptical about the quality of this course.

2020-12-22 00:00:00,Ridzwanurahim B N,5.0,0.0,"
I've found that this course has helped lay clear based on evidence the 
best ways to tackle learning efficiently. It can definitely be taken and
 applied in any facet of everyday life and is a useful skill to have. 
One more interesting thing is that it has definitely provided a 
diagnosis to my problems of tackling subjects efficiently in the past, 
so it has been very valuable in that sense.

2020-06-27 00:00:00,Deborah A J L,5.0,0.0,"The most phenomenal course I’ve taken. Taught me that we learn “learning” differently at each stage of our lives. I toke this course twice and the first time it was in my mid-50s taiko it again at late 50s and learned even more. I only wish that what I know now I knew in my  20’s a30’s. But alas, don’t we all. I applaud all the professors and please know that I will continue coming back to it. "
2020-05-14 00:00:00,Rafael C,5.0,0.0,"Incredible course. It opened my mind to a lot of many things. The knowledge and technics gained in this course are worth taking for life. Knowing how your brain works and more specifically how it learns made me understand a lot of things and made me change how i thought or was taught to do it. I hope now to learn a lot of new things and destroy my mentality of ""hating to learn"" made by school."
2018-10-09 00:00:00,Peter W,5.0,0.0,"This is a hands-on (or brains-on) course that introduces ideas and techniques that are applicable to daily life, be it studying or work. The Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of timed and focused work) has helped me develop better study habits, and the concepts of interleaving and diffused thinking have helped me take a new approach to studying and figuring out solutions for my professional life."
2017-07-20 00:00:00,April P,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course! I really appreciate having stumbled across it in a blog post online. It has taught me a better understanding of myself and how I might better apply myself in my learning to compliment and expand my career and personal life.

2016-11-13 00:00:00,Tammy L,5.0,0.0,"This course covers the physical and psychological aspects of learning (i.e., how you feel when procrastinating, and what chemicals affect which parts of learning). I liked that it did not try to fit everyone into a mould, but still gave tips on the most effective ways a person learns. The instructors are quite nice and the lectures are very short which makes it easy to take in smaller chunks."

The Videos focus on the key concepts in a fun an memorable way, the additional material was always helpful and the repetition (in the videos and the exams) maximized the outcome. The one thing I wished would be an update of the ""further reading"" section (all the articles and papers have been published around 2014)"
2017-02-07 00:00:00,Marilyne L,5.0,0.0,Ce cours était vraiment incroyable. Il a complètement changé ma manière d'apprendre et aussi et ma manière d'approcher une connaissance.

2020-10-15 00:00:00,Ben ,5.0,0.0,"  An incredibly explorative and fun course! The professors teaching really know what they're talking about and don't just teach you the theories behind how the brain works on learning, but also what to do with this knowledge: how to implement it. The presentations are very illustrative and thereby help you to further understand the material. I enjoyed it very much. It is a MOOC like no other!  "

Then, in the Mindshift course, I went into Barb's basement and found out that this was all DIY and she learned how to do video editing just for the course.

Though it is taking quite time & discipline, but still the techniques really works very well. Hope by continuing this forever, let me revamp myself going forward swiftly.  I suggest everyone to take up this course.  Thanks to the Instructors."
2020-01-28 00:00:00,Mariko M,5.0,0.0,"Super efficient for me. When my friend recommended me to take this course, I failed the exam several times. However I still did not reflect back on my study method, and I even ignored his advice to take the course. At that time, I believed in myself that, studying longer hours will only lead to success, which is absolutely not. Now I am super thankful to my friend. Thank you Sergey!"
2019-03-02 00:00:00,VERONICA D C M G,5.0,0.0,"This course is really valuable, every student in the world must follow it, because education is the only key to make our brain grow up. Sometimes we feel we cannot learn something in life, but with this kind of tools shown during the course, any people can get it. If we understand our brain, our own process of learning, among others, our lives could change for better. Thanks a lot!!"
2017-02-27 00:00:00,Mark,5.0,0.0,"Brilliant course! Though I wished the quizzes incorporated (one of the learning tips in the course) interleaved distributed practice, e.g. testing week 2's material in week 3, etc. Also, the wrong answers in quizzes tended to be not tricky enough, i.e., someone who hasn't learned the material adequately could just do the quizzes and pass, since the wrong answers are obviously wrong."
2015-09-01 00:00:00,Sean M G,5.0,0.0,Very enjoyable and helpful course best way to speed up learning and save lot's of time you can spend with friends and relatives instead of wasting it with bad and time consuming learning methods. So before signing up for the next course consider first signing up for LEARNING HOW TO LEARN and see how you can make your next course a much more fun experience once you know how to learn. 
2021-11-30 00:00:00,Matias B,5.0,0.0,"I​ honestly really enjoyed every minute of it, it gave me new ideas and points to look and use for learning anything, because i wasnt so sure on how to do it properly while using bad techniques or wasting time, i will rewatch it sometime in another instance, thank so much for creating this awesome course and i hope you the best of wishes both Barbara and Terrence, lovely persons <3"
2021-10-25 00:00:00,Abdelrhman E,5.0,0.0,"It is one of the good things in our world that a course like this is available for nearly everyone, and for free!

It helped me confirm effective learning techniques, be aware of learning illusions and know how to master anything I want to learn but still the most amazing thing about this course is the fascination I felt when I begin to learn about the human brain and how it works.
"
2020-11-02 00:00:00,Thomas B,5.0,0.0,Excellent course with great instructors. The videos are easy to follow and the short quizzes throughout make sure you've understood the material. Some of the reading sources mentioned were outdated however and linked to sites that were no longer available. The companion book is also a great read and I recommend it to anyone wanting to dive further into the subject of meta-learning. 
2020-09-24 00:00:00,Lesley S,5.0,0.0,Wish I had this information a few decades ago while I was in college.  Looking forward to using this now as I recover from a TBI.  I am 1 year post concussion and am still having issues with processing and learning information.  I had difficulty reading and was off work for 10 months.  My back ground is chemical engineering and zero emission vehicle technologies and infrastructure.
2020-08-31 00:00:00,Miss Z P,5.0,0.0,"One of the best courses I have ever done! And I have done quite a few (got up to masters degree). I loved every bit of it!
Great lecturers! Easy to listen to. 
All the time whilst learning, I kept thinking of how much time and energy I have lost over the years of learning wrongly. Thank you for this opportunity and knowledge. I hope to use it by helping my children in their learning."
2020-07-11 00:00:00,Sadi M,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course, full of helpful, easy-to-digest information, relayed in a friendly, positive, repetitive manner. Points were repeated in similar fashions, to express the same meaning, but show from a slightly different vantage point to further ingrain the material. Frequent use of personal insight questions helped to cement the information further into the long term memory."
2017-01-29 00:00:00,Jonathan V,5.0,0.0,"Engaging, witty, informative, compulsive, persuasive and effective. Nothing fancy, just a smart presenter putting it over in a way that makes sense supported by the science and academic papers that give it credibility. Yet so many people have tried to do this in the past? It is the magic of combining an online platform that is of its age and works, and someone with a story to tell. "
2017-01-15 00:00:00,johann,5.0,0.0,"If your your are looking for the  formula to use your brain with more efficiency. Take this course right now. And the end of the course, i was mixed with two feelings why haven't i enrolled myself earlier and welcome to a new-me ready to explore an ocean of new subjects .   I send a warm thanks to Barb and Terence for the quality of their work and for having shared their knowledge.  "
2016-11-26 00:00:00,Tanya V,5.0,0.0,"This course was the most efficient and complete I've ever watched. I'm so gratefull that I have an opportunity to enhance my learning skills. These materials can be called 'gold' without any doubts. I will try to put in practice everything I've got in this course. Also, I want to say a tremendous  Thank You to the creators and participants of this course! This work was worth doing. "
2016-03-29 00:00:00,MUKUL B,5.0,0.0,"Before starting or learning any course of your interest, I would urge you to First Do THIS course completely and then, I am sure the efficiency of learning  will drastically increase and will give a feeling of satisfaction.
I would like to Thank Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski for such a great course material and the learning experience which they shared.

2021-03-12 00:00:00,Ravindran T,5.0,0.0,This is one of the best courses that I have attended online. It has given me a lot of tips and tricks about how to learn new concepts.  The concepts are explained by Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski in a way which is easy to follow and recall. I feel really fortunate to have got an opportunity to come across this course. I will strongly recommend this course for everyone.
2020-12-03 00:00:00,Tony R,5.0,0.0,"It's been a very interesting course, with much to learn, and I will make sure to apply the skills I learnt to my life. I would encourage everyone to take the course, whether you are interested in literature, science, art, you name it. There are also plenty of interviews with leading experts in various fields which give insights into learning techniques, procrastination and memory."
2020-07-04 00:00:00,Tajh L,5.0,0.0,"This is an excellent course, I wish I had taken it earlier. The Coursera interface is not intuitive for me - In fact I thought I had completed the course however only realized that I hadn't when I received a request for a poll on why I didn't complete the course!  I did end up finishing the course, you have to keep clicking on ""next"" to get past many things to get to the very end."
2020-04-26 00:00:00,Pranjal P,5.0,0.0,  This course was insightful. I have experienced a paradigm shift in the way I used to understand learning. I had my set of mental blocks that prevented me from enjoying the learning process. I had reached a point in my life where learning new concepts were more of a burden. And procrastination had affected most aspects of my life. This course has changed the way I look at learning.   
2019-06-14 00:00:00,Pedro C,5.0,0.0,"I would like to leave a word of appreciation to Dr. Barbara and Dr. Terrence, and Coursera, for creating a great course on learning available to anyone on the globe. I believe concepts such as chunking, the difference between focused and diffused modes, working and long-term memory, and suggestions for dealing with procrastination, will be empowering for anyone taking this course!"
2017-07-23 00:00:00,Johnny L,5.0,0.0,"I can't recommend this course highly enough. It's probably the single most important course I've taken so far in anything. It doesn't require much time or effort, but the outcome is pretty mindblowing, at least for a person who is used to slave away for nothing like me. Since I've applied the learning techniques from this course, my studying has become much more effecient and fun!"
2017-07-07 00:00:00,Server K,5.0,0.0,"First of all, thank you very much for sharing the material. It was really helpful and I feel that I benefit from it now. I have changed my approach to learn and now I keep in mind all the important thing that you have mentioned during the course. Therefore, I think I will recommend this course to everyone, who wants to improve their studying performances. 
Once again, thanks a lot! "
2017-04-22 00:00:00,Hello,5.0,0.0,"It provides me many important and new knowledge or ideas about learning based on the research result of Neuroscience.

Also you will find how this course differ from other courses on Coursera in many details, as well as how the course instructors care for their students!"
2016-12-02 00:00:00,Ram C,5.0,0.0,"It was a really interesting course, with great ideas and lots of tips to boost one's learning process. The optional interviews was a great bonus as well. What made it even more wonderful is the weekly mails I get now from the instructors of this course, Barb and Terry, with suggested books and MOOC's. So glad that I decided to join this and completed it. Thank you for creating it!"
2016-02-22 00:00:00,Grato R,5.0,0.0,"I've only finished the 1st week, yet, I can say that LH2L is very effective. My learning abilities have greatly improved. It helps a lot to understand how our brain works for a more effective learning. 
It is so good that I am going to buy the book ""A Mind for Numbers"". Thanks Barbara Oakley, Dr. Sejnowski, and everyone else for making this course free and available to everybody :)"
2022-08-11 00:00:00,Keoagile M,5.0,0.0,"This is a really great course. It is logical, practical and easy to understand.

They are kind and you get the sense that they really care.
 "
2021-12-21 00:00:00,Akshay V,5.0,0.0,"This course is really important because it focuses on something which is  basic and required for everything one might want to do in life or is doing in life. Humans learn all the time, being able to learn better and consciously put an effort into learning better is skill without which it is a shame and a waste of one's potential. Go through this course, it's worth it and precise.  "
2020-12-17 00:00:00,Avgi A,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course. I am trying to somehow ""escape"" from my current job and focus on learning a new subject. As I found myself struggling, I decided to take this course first and I believe I made the rightest choice. Thank you Drs! You have been great! With your kind way there were times I felt you next to me telling me ""everything can happen, just relax, focus and let it flow""."
2020-07-22 00:00:00,Andi S R,5.0,0.0,"It should be mandatory to have this type of material as part of a regular curriculum in the earlier years of a student path. This course shows, with a rigorous foundation, the way we learn and how we can improve ourselves with different techniques. I liked that through the course it was emphasized that we can, with a positive attitude and perseverance, achieve what we truly love!"
2020-05-20 00:00:00,Prof. H Z,5.0,0.0,"Life Tranforming Material: Highly Qualified, Very well Trained Instructors ,They have done brilliant work in producing this course.This course is filled with enormous amount of authentic research.I am an academician who had lost touch with learning with a fresh eye have got new perspective.Highly recommended to all Teachers,Professors and everyone who wants to learn How to learn."
2020-05-19 00:00:00,Charles H M,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed the course and especially the tone set by Dr Oakley who maintained high quality and a light spirit throughout the teachings. I loved the way things came together for me as an older person and how they reinforced old ideas from the past. Well done to the team and to Coursera. If it wasn't Covid-19 time and my business limping, I would have purchased the course willingly. "
2020-04-20 00:00:00,Kate R,5.0,0.0,"This was a great class to learn how your brain functions, how YOU learn best, as well as a few tips and tricks for test-taking. Barbara Oakley was a wonderful professor in this series - she used tricks throughout the sessions to make sure you were learning while you went through the course. She also sent out loads of resources to follow up and dive into. I would highly recommend! "
2018-05-28 00:00:00,Vinicius S M,5.0,0.0,"I can't help but imagine a world where everyone know how to learn properly. So many people have dropped out of school or simply neglected their education during all their lives because they feel anxious and ultimately hate it. Imagine if they did not need to feel like that as much, as this course teaches us. How many brilliant ideas and scientists and ideas would have flourished? "
2018-01-31 00:00:00,Kyris T K T,5.0,0.0,"I completed this course!
Coming to this course with some initial doubts, I ended up learning more than expected. There were times that I thought I would not continue the course due to my hectic schedule. However, Dr. Oakley is a great teacher, as she always managed to inspire and instil the thirst for knowledge in me. Can't thank her enough for sharing her useful pieces of wisdom."
2017-11-30 00:00:00,Leona M,5.0,0.0,"One of the best short courses available for learning how to learn, I love all the new tools that you have enabled me to use.  I am looking forward to my new adventure and tackling a diploma, and now feel confident with the learning process and best I can apply this to my new course. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Only one more word to describe the experience I have undertaken.  "
2016-08-06 00:00:00,Jover E P,5.0,0.0,"It has helped me , because I want to be a better student. I'm studying engineering and I want to do well in my career , but I find it difficult and I think that if I follow the advice of this course , I can do it better. I would also like to improve my English ( I am from Spain ) and practice a little every day with the pomodoro technique . Thank you so much, you helped me a lot.  "
2016-01-26 00:00:00,Carson R,5.0,0.0,I really enjoyed this course.  This course is a great blend of neuroscience and actual learning tactics and principles.  Both Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski present solid information in a casual yet informed manner and make staying on the course very interesting.  I find the techniques described very useful for any endeavor that requires focused learning for a lifetime.  Excellent!
2022-08-14 00:00:00,Arun S,5.0,0.0,"I found this course highly useful, in that it helped me understand better and efficient methods of learning.  It goes in depth upon some important effects of sleep in learning.  The neuroscience behind learning was crucial in understanding why the methods work.  I would certainly practice these techniques to enhance memory and retention.  I also liked the chunk creation section."
2022-05-12 00:00:00,Tarek E,5.0,0.0,"Course is extermly useful and effective .. the used technique is so engaging and helpful ... truly lucky to ge inrolled in this programe , i have finished Learn how to learn and i am so excited to start the second part of the course Mindshifting , great technique in teaching is being used & the investment in such course is totaly worth it :)

2022-01-23 00:00:00,Joshua J,5.0,0.0,"Wish I had gone through this when I started college. My recommendation is to use Anki and create question-like notes for this course and use the practice of spaced repetition to solidify this learnings. Another option would be to review this course once a year! If you're in college, do it before the start of each semester to refresh this ideas and go in with a strong foundation! "
2020-10-31 00:00:00,KOH Y E,5.0,0.0,I learnt a lot from the course and feel more confident now tackling new areas. The understanding of focused and diffused mode of learning is especially meaningful to me. I can now link my behaviours/ actions / outcome to make learning more effective. These are also a lot of good practical techniques that i want to apply and use. Thank you for making this course so easy to learn.
2020-10-25 00:00:00,Vince D,5.0,0.0,"It is very general and basic, which is a good quality for courses like this. The concepts are explained in a very simple and broad manner that makes it easy to understand and apply in any discipline. The important concepts are highlighted really well by being concise and repeating it over multiple videos that I still remember them even if I have only watched all the videos once."
2020-04-10 00:00:00,Umer S,5.0,0.0,A great insight towards how the brain is a beautiful and exquisite intermingle of complexity and at the same time simplicity. The techniques mentioned in the course are really helpful  towards enhancing the productivity of the brain and the concepts provided puts light on not only the cause of the daily shortcomings faced by many people but also how to tackle these shortcomings.
2017-09-05 00:00:00,Darío C L,5.0,0.0,"Great course. All the tools that are proposed can be used ASAP therefore you area able to see how using this strategies work. Also I loved the fact that I had an explanation of how does this strategies work on a neurological level. I had been told to use certain techniques but I was doubtful and did not tried them before, now I have learned also to give myself a chance to do it."
2017-03-13 00:00:00,Pbat23,5.0,0.0,"This course has been my company during my morning commute to work and I couldn't be happier.
The videos are easy to watch, the information is easy to retain and there are funny jokes along the way.
Thank you so much for your work, I learned many techniques to improve my learning capacity and I understand better how the brain works! It made me curious to learn more about our brain."
2016-02-14 00:00:00,Jessica J,5.0,0.0,"So far, I really like the Course. I think Barbara and Terrence are really nice. I liked it very much, that Barbara told us a bit about her life. It showed me that it is never to late to start with something new. 
I also like they way they explain things. Really simple and very understandable. I am pretty sure I will apply a lot of things. I am looking forward to the next Session. "
2015-08-14 00:00:00,Timothy O,5.0,0.0,"Provides practical and applicable insights into how the physiology of the brain impacts learning.

Strongly recommended for anyone interested in learning, whether in math, science, humanities, or law."
2019-08-26 00:00:00,liyangzhuo,5.0,0.0,"I think this lesson is quite different from the others, for it offers some new methods of how to learn better ,which I have not heard before. Surprisingly, it gives us quite a lot of information about the relationship between our learning skills and architecture of our brains.I think this lesson matters a lot in my whole life, for I am always learning new things on my life way. "
2019-07-28 00:00:00,Ignacy Ś,5.0,0.0,I wish I had discovered this course before I graduated from my university. It took me a while to discover by trial and error some of the concepts from the course which would make my university time much more productive and some of the concepts were totally new to me. I hope other people will be more lucky than I was and will discover and incorporate this much earlier in life :) 
2018-09-02 00:00:00,Efren,5.0,0.0,"The course is introduces you to many practice techniques to improve your learning.  The potential field application is extremely broad and I think that this is why its the most popular course.  I think it would be helpful to improve upon the practical area of the course by having things like ""ok pause this video and go exercise"" to really embed the suggestions into us students."
2018-07-12 00:00:00,KGeorge,5.0,0.0,"I expected to learn a bunch of study strategies from this course but instead, I've learned how our brains work, and it especially helped in building mindfulness and positive thinking, not just learning a new subject.Although those study strategies are definitely useful while learning a new subject, the whole course's material is applicable to the concept of learning in general."
2016-01-10 00:00:00,Tien K,5.0,0.0,"Although I have already practiced ~80% of the techniques taught in this course (i.e. Pomodoro, spaced repetition, getting enough sleep, recall, testing self, etc.), I still learned new things, and this course convinced me that I've been doing the right things but can make some improvements. I especially love the zombies! They remind me of Plants vs. Zombies in an endearing way."
2015-08-24 00:00:00,Folarin A,5.0,0.0,"Very informative with great references for those who want to dive deeper not only into practical steps for great learning but also into the psychology and neuroscience of learning. With lecturers that seem genuinely passionate about the subject matter and test-questions that are neither too hard nor seeking excessively personal information. Feels so great learning how to learn!
"
2022-05-19 00:00:00,ALEJANDRO L A ,5.0,0.0,Trully effective and usefull techniques are shared in this course.  I now have additional and upgraded style of learning. Highly recommended for students struggling to cope up with their subjects and assignments. Its enjoyable to learn new things such as this approach. I wish i had this lectures during my Highschool and college time. I may be an Honor students during my time..
2020-08-27 00:00:00,Mahmoud M,5.0,0.0,"Very beneficial course, telling you how your brain works and how you can get the most out of it, you do not have to be genius or gifted to have a good memory or do great stuff. Your brain is a gift and you can just know how to use it. many techniques I have learned to be used during studying any subject. I even learned how to overcome procrastination and help improve my memory"
2019-03-31 00:00:00,Rafael M,5.0,0.0,"Out of tenths of MOOCs i have started, i've only finished two, and this is the second of them. If you know about MOOCs statistics, that would say enough, but not to be so short in words, the course is good and keeps you engaged because it teaches you usable, applicable concepts, that require just a fair amount of time to go through, and that are taught in a accessible way. 5/5"
2015-10-13 00:00:00,Manolo A,5.0,0.0,Extremely useful course. I wish I had been exposed to this information two decades ago. I have started to use techniques learned not only in studying but also in other areas of both my personal and professional life. Learning is part of our personal lifelong evolution. It is a gift to learn how to improve this process. Thanks to the professors for their wonderful contribution.

Through this, I feel motivated to study for my upcoming midterms and to continue studying and learning with the techniques I've learned. Thank you so much to the amazing professors for teaching me so well! God bless everyone!"
2020-07-10 00:00:00,Al P,5.0,0.0,"This course was very beneficial on my current studies.  It reminded me to not push myself, but to know when to take a break and sort out problems later.  Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski really lightened up my understanding and I can't wait to start the next course ""Mindshift"". Overall, this course was very interesting to learn about. May you all have a great study session!"

2019-07-13 00:00:00,Ana P,5.0,0.0,"Learned so much, is very much so learning the science of your brain and how to apply that science to everything in life. I believe if you actually applied all these things to your core skills and habits you could achieve an amazing level of non-stop efficiency. At very first the videos seem kind of dated and a little slow, but you quickly get into it and respect the speakers."
2019-04-06 00:00:00,Anastasiadius,5.0,0.0,"A very useful course! Especially together with a book Mind for Numbers!
I knew about the Pomodoro technique before, but I wasn't enthusiastic enough to use it. But after getting to know that it's better to concentrate on the process not on the product during that course, this Pomodoro technique has more sense for me now and I am more likely to use it. 
Thank you for the course!"
2017-08-08 00:00:00,Julia K W,5.0,0.0,"A spectacular course for anyone who is having a difficult time learning subjects that are new to them, or who is working on completing a long-term project, or just anyone who likes to learn but wants to optimize their learning habits. This class is absolutely super for all of those needs and has helped me quite a lot. Thanks so much!! :) It gets an A+ in my book, for sure! ;) "
2017-03-23 00:00:00,Saad R,5.0,0.0,"This course taught me how to learn, introduced me to a lot of other things I wanna learn about, it taught me how to teach, it taught me how to read! (I had it completely wrong!) it taught me, to some extent, how to remember. And most importantly, it taught me how to beat procrastination. I am already teaching two people these course's techniques. Thank you Dr. Barbara Oakley!"
2016-03-09 00:00:00,Katie d R,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course! Really easy to understand and apply to your own studies.

It will surely help me in life going forward."
2022-06-30 00:00:00,Tarek A,5.0,0.0,"I regret that I never stumbled upon this course or anything near it earlier. The materials, logical structure of the course, the amount of knowlege doses given during each video lecture, the references, the quality of interviews and interviewees and tests are all carefully prepared to maximise the learning outcome. Above all, they are presented in fun and an interesting way."
2020-09-07 00:00:00,Glendale R,5.0,0.0,"This course was amazing! I truly believe the content in this course can help so many struggling students who incorrectly think they are ""not smart"". Using these techniques, especially at an early age, can drastically change someone's life. I wish I knew this information when I was in school! Great teachers, amazing content. One of the best Coursera courses I have ever taken!"
2018-12-10 00:00:00,Arnav K,5.0,0.0,I really enjoyed this course and found the lessons to be invaluable. I have always been very curious and an enthusiastic learner but never approached my learning in a strategic fashion.

From the topics of how to tackle procrastination, all the knowledge about einstellung, short- and long-term memory, chunking, creating vivid analogies and metaphors, avoiding overconfidence, etc, all this knowledge has a direct impact on the adequate completion of our duties.

2019-05-09 00:00:00,Muthuselvan,5.0,0.0,"This is an awesome course and helped me to learn and unlearn some of the concepts about brain functioning while learning and also teaching effective techniques to learn. The study materials, course tests and videos from masters have helped to feel more confident and am sure that I can learn anything new with this methodology. Thank you Barb and Terry for this great course !"
2016-07-12 00:00:00,Aliza B,5.0,0.0,"This course was sooo useful!  I am starting college in the fall and thought this might help me; it definitely will.  The main instructor is great; she explains things very well.  If I learned one thing from this course, it is that I need to go back and forth between focused and diffuse modes of thinking.  Just that one thing has helped me immeasurably since I've learned it.  "
2021-07-26 00:00:00,Sujata D,5.0,0.0,The course has given me several insights into learning how to learn. The presentation style and the content of the videos made it very interesting and I am really grateful to Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejowski for their genorisity in sharing their knowledge and insights on a platform that would enable access to so many others. Thank you to Coursera too for creating this platform.
2021-06-12 00:00:00,Chen W Z,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course. Simple, concise and short, but rich with information on how to study more effectively. What goes above and beyond the ordinary study tip advisor is that they involve significant amounts of neuroscience to explain why some things work and why some don't, which is super duper interesting. In general, it's an excellent course, and I recommend you to take it."
2020-06-14 00:00:00,Cristobal B,5.0,0.0,"Lo disfrute mucho, ademas aprendi nuevos conceptos y consolide conceptos que estaban poco entendendos. Los videos son cortos, aun asi hay veces que me costo llevarlos adelante. El tiempo en 4 semanas es muy bueno para tomarse la informacion de manera sencilla y permitir que aciente. La pasion y el compromiso de quien lo dicta aumento mucho mi participacion. Muchas Gracias."
2020-05-11 00:00:00,Nandini G,5.0,0.0,"Great experience with great instructors. Able to get familiar with new ways of learning and new concepts that are very helpful for higher education and learning.

2022-06-17 00:00:00,Travis E,5.0,0.0,"I already love learning new things so having a guide show me how learning works behind the scenes allows me to now understand the things I've been doing either consciously or subconsciously or not doing, and move them to their appropriate areas. I can't say much because though I did learn many new things, not everything was quite new to me but I'd say it was all valuable."
2020-03-31 00:00:00,Abhipsa M,5.0,0.0,This was a wonderful course. I enjoyed and learned mental frameworks and tools thoroughly. I'm sure they will help me with whatever I will learn in my future. I wish I had encountered this course previously. Plus the optional interviews with deeply passionate individuals and some Nobel Laureates were extremely insightful. Truly there are so many ways to approach learning. 
2016-12-21 00:00:00,Kevin H,5.0,0.0,"I wish that this was a subject of it's own in the high school curriculum in Australia!
The tools presented are certainly useful in the approach of learning but very much applicable to many other areas of my own lifestyle. This course has certainly provided both motivation and stimulation for me to enhance aspects of my life previously lacking in effort.
Thank you very much!"
2015-09-06 00:00:00,Oswaldo M,5.0,0.0,"
Este curso me permitio obtener un nuevo enfoque de como debo llevar o crear nuevas rutinas para lograr aprender de forma eficaz.

2015-09-06 00:00:00,Florence L,5.0,0.0,"Learning how to learn is truly inspiring, especially thanks to Barbara Oakley. Everybody starting his or her school/ university life should have access to this knowledge. It is really sad that none of my teachers ever showed us how to learn and why. But I guess they didn't know better themselves. But learning never stops, so I am looking forward to use this knowledge now."

2021-09-08 00:00:00,Sonia S,5.0,0.0,"E​asy to digest ""chunks"" of material offered in compact segments which were easy to follow made comprehension and completion of the materials quite manageable. I feel well armed with enough techniques and tips to make me much better at learning so I consider the course a great success. Can't go wrong if you just implement the techniques laid out in Learning How to Learn."
2020-12-29 00:00:00,Joey C,5.0,0.0,Excellent course taught by people who really know their stuff. Dr. Barbara Oakley is great at explaining things in an easy-to-digest manner and seems like a fun person to grab a beer with.

2020-11-02 00:00:00,Satwik K,5.0,0.0,"This course is very inisghtful in contrast to those shalllow articles and videos that circulate on the internet about how to learn better. It gave me much more knowledge about ""how"" learning works instead of just handing some hacky tricks (which most materials seems to do). So because of that knowledge, I can even come up with my own hacks, and that's something powerful!"
2020-07-29 00:00:00,Elizabeth V L,5.0,0.0,"An amazing course, explains complex topics really easy, entertaining to watch, knowing that i am learning.

2020-05-19 00:00:00,aline,5.0,0.0,Amazing! the course recommendation is to take in 4 weeks but was so interesting and with so usable learnings that were simple to understand and enjoyable to watch that I finished the whole course in 1 week.

It affirmed what most of us who have found success in academics have been doing for years, so it was nice to find out that these techniques have been appointed names.

2017-09-21 00:00:00,Shane G,5.0,0.0,A fantastic course! Thank you for challenging the way I used to think about learning - and keeping me mindful of spending more time on problem questions instead of trying to read every piece of information in the textbook. I know now that I need to spend more time applying what I learn and testing myself instead of trying to understand the minute detail of every concept.
2016-02-10 00:00:00,Siddhesh W,5.0,0.0,"This is one of the best courses on learning how to learn.

2015-11-07 00:00:00,BETANAPALLI S,5.0,0.0,"
This is improving my strength towards completing courses. I like it a lot.
A humble request is please upload video lectures of duration more than 15 min. After watching a video we are relaxing. If videos are of small duration I will take much time for us to complete lectures as it includes more relax time. If videos are of more duration we can complete them in small time."

Also it spells out procrastination and how to handle it in a way that clicked for me, more so than any forum on mental health that I'd found so far, so that's been exceptionally helpful."

2018-09-08 00:00:00,jamie b,5.0,0.0,This course is the best and the most powerful course PERIOD.

Learning how to learn should become mandatory at schools and not just for higher classes. THAT is the single most important skill students will need in their future lives.

2020-06-11 00:00:00,Anđa D,5.0,0.0,I highly suggest this course as a start point for any high school or college student (or anyone really).

2020-05-08 00:00:00,Zoe S,5.0,0.0,"Thank you for such an exciting learning experience. I now have a better understanding of the challenges  experienced through my life with learning.  I have gained, through this course, a better understanding of how the brain functions and how simply I am able to tap into these basic fundamentals of learning to make a difference. This material is golden!"
2020-05-08 00:00:00,Sunil R,5.0,0.0,"All the things that are mentioned in the course are helpful for anyone who want to learn new skills effectively, who thinks that they don't have what it takes to learn any difficult subjects. I wish I knew these teachings before when I was school or college, but now I know it and I'm certainly gonna take it in use. Do give it a try, you won't regret it. "
2020-05-04 00:00:00,Mariana G d S,5.0,0.0,"This course is really good. It explains how our brain works, how we can deal with procrastination, how to change a habit, what happens in our brains when we learn something new, what we should do to really learn and what to avoid.
I highly recommend this course for everybody who wants to understand how our brain works and how we can develop ourselves. :)"
2018-01-29 00:00:00,Randy H,5.0,0.0,This was an eye opening course for me.  I learned a lot of new tools and concepts and a whole new way to approach learning.  I wish this had been available to me when I was a student but I feel it has tremendous value for anyone who wants to learn something new.  The instructors were great and presented the material in an easy to understand and fun way.
2016-04-02 00:00:00,Ramnath K,5.0,0.0,This course has been immensely useful in identifying the mistakes I was making in learning new things. I have been able to understand why even after putting in a lot of effort my grasp of concepts remained brittle and prone to be forgotten when recalling after some time. This is a must take course for anyone who like me is struggling to master concepts.
2022-08-15 00:00:00,Alexandra M S,5.0,0.0,"This course was a great combination of understanding how the human brain works and different techniques to actually improve ones learning abilities by studying more effectively. The material was presented in a really positive way and created a lot of motivation to pursue ones dreams and view studying from a different, much less frustrating perspective."
2021-10-19 00:00:00,Marcos A S S,5.0,0.0,"El curso es grandioso! Me ha dado valiosas herramientas que podré usar ahora y en el futuro para aprender correctamente cualquier materia que desee. 
Sin duda, fue un curso intenso. 
Pude darme cuenta de lo equivocado que estuve durante años respecto al enfoque que usaba para abordar temas difíciles, en cierto modo este curso me ha ayudado a ""despertar""."
2021-09-29 00:00:00,Cheuk Y L,5.0,0.0,"The course is structured to help students retain what they have learnt, 
i.e. they do what they preach. I learnt many new ideas and understood 
some of the science behind advice I have previously received about 
learning. I recommend this course to anybody unfamiliar with learning 
how to learn, even for those who already have a strong academic record. 
      
"
2021-05-13 00:00:00,Александр К,5.0,0.0,"Отличный курс, буду рекомендовать его всем. Мне кажется такое должны проходить в школе, я очень рад что прошел его. Я уверен что это поможет мне в жизни. Полученные знания начали реально помогать мне уже в ходе прохождения курса. Единственное что расстроило - плохой перевод на русский из-за этого иногда трудно воспринимать информацию и проходить тесты."
2021-02-22 00:00:00,BC B,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course! I was discouraged and burnt out from my past profession, and wasn't sure what changes to make and how to make those necessary changes in my life. This course has been so encouraging, enlightening and motivating that is helping me face my challenges and hopefully to make positive changes in the near future. Thank you, Debbie and Terry!"
2020-12-31 00:00:00,Hans G Q,5.0,0.0,It is an exceptional course that makes you understand the way your learn. You will learn truly tools to improve your learning process in any field!

A valuable insight for those passionate to learn.
2020-07-13 00:00:00,STEFANO P C,5.0,0.0,"  Great course on learning. In here, you will learn about how the brain works and with that knowledge, you'll learn to make the most efficient use of it. The instructors are good and the videos have a lot of visual aids to help. This is one of the first online courses I took and I believe I learned as much as if I was in a classroom with the instructors.  "
2020-05-04 00:00:00,Rebekah M,5.0,0.0,It has been a long time since doing any sort of online learning/ training and this was the perfect start back into it. Barbara and Terrence perfectly breakdown segments of information and make the learning process seem more understandable and manageable. I can't wait to take the skills I have learned in this course to make the most out of the next one!
2019-11-21 00:00:00,Bartholomew A,5.0,0.0,"This course was eye opening in terms of giving more new tools to utilize as I finish my last semester and take this new found knowledge into my daily job. Some of the techniques I had already learned on my own but most of them were very new to me! I definitely think this is a worth while course, if you have the time please I insist you try and take it! "
2019-07-23 00:00:00,Brandon E,5.0,0.0,A lot of people mention that they don't remember the things in high school due to the fact that they just purely relied on memorization. This course is essential to learning information to prepare you for future courses and life tasks. Stop relying on memorization and start recalling the information and putting your knowledge through quizzes and tests.
2017-12-08 00:00:00,Blishda L,5.0,0.0,The class was well paced well and interesting.  I  developed skills that I wish I had learned in high school :-). I gained great insight into how we learn and was able to apply what I learned everyday.  I found myself constantly sharing the information and tips I learned with family and friends and really getting excited while talking about the course.
2017-04-11 00:00:00,Tudor M,5.0,0.0,"Hello, I met here some extraordinary people. The course was very exciting, intriguing and remarcable concise. As a lecturer (with a degree in Civil Engineering) I found this course very useful for my futures lessons, the way of learning that is taught here is fitting like a glove. I feel that I have improved my way of thinking and I thank you for that. "
2016-11-15 00:00:00,Daniel K,5.0,0.0,"I learned many new techniques on how to effectively learn new things, the Pomodoro technique,  recall practice, using metaphor and analogies, team learning, and many others.  These can also be used to retain and better understand already learned material.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone and will be sharing it with my family and friends."
2016-10-24 00:00:00,Imran H,5.0,0.0,"One of the best courses on the internet. They should teach a simplified version of this from grade 1. If we somehow manage to include the topics mentioned in this course for kids, I truly believe we will be able to change the lives of everyone on the planet. If we are lucky we will also be able to save the planet before we reach the point of no return."
2016-09-10 00:00:00,CW D,5.0,0.0,Oakley (with support from other researchers) provides some handy study tools in this healthy guide to good study habits. The lectures are accessible to any learning level---middle-schoolers to graduate students. The lectures and quizzes reinforce material from her book. Highly recommended for everybody who wants to get the most out of their study time. 
2016-02-15 00:00:00,Joshua H,5.0,0.0,"I wish I had this course before I started college. I'm pretty sure at one point or another I did everything exactly opposite of what this course teaches. I often crammed, did not study effectively, and definitely fooled myself on multiple occasions of thinking I understood material. 

Everyone who is serious about learning better should take this course. "
2016-01-31 00:00:00,Kwan C K,5.0,0.0,"This course has taught me  the key points and methods to improve the learning processes more effectively and efficiency.  There are plenty of helpful hits, skills and strategies for gaining better performance in the my study processes.  Now I have more understanding the factors of successfully learning and being more concentrate in new things learning."

2020-11-20 00:00:00,Dima A,5.0,0.0,  this course helped me to better understand the basic tools i need to learn and how to better myself through learning.Barbara is one of the best teachers i had and her life story just motivated me to try and learn new aspects or subjects that i didn't think or wasn't confident enough that i can learn or even understand (besides engineering).Thank a lot  
2020-07-03 00:00:00,GSR M,5.0,0.0,"It is a great course! I am learning this at the age of 54.

I am very satisfied with what I learned in this course and I am sure that it will be something useful all my life."
2020-04-26 00:00:00,Manuela L,5.0,0.0,"An eye-opening course that gives you the confidence to approach learning on almost anything. Even if many ideas presented in this course are intuitive, for example using recall to make sure information is persisted in your memory, you will gain more self-awareness in the process of studying/working and you can start applying the knowledge to yourself."
2019-01-21 00:00:00,Raul G C,5.0,0.0,"I guess I didn't want it to end because I kept extending the deadline. I wanted it to keep going and giving things to think about and learn.  I am still processing everything, but I see myself using this information for myself and in my somewhat new career as an ESL teacher. Many thanks for everyone that made this course happen and made it so coooool!"
2017-11-26 00:00:00,Wesley T,5.0,0.0,"Excellent overview, great simple, relaxing presentation and important content. I would love a class that focused more on the neuroscience and hard biology of the topic of effective learning and retention. A video concentrating on tactics for unlearning incorrectly learned facts and habits and reducing Einstellung will improve the course in my opinion."
2017-10-10 00:00:00,Tasha L H,5.0,0.0,Wow this course has seriously helped me open my mind on how I learn things. So many true things in this course that I experienced and now know why. I'm pumped for my future. I want to learn everything even things outside my possible career choices. With these tools I can truly break the barriers of learning. Break old habits and teach myself new ones. 
2017-01-11 00:00:00,Troy J,5.0,0.0,"I love this course. When I am starting to struggle in a class and cannot figure out what I am doing wrong I always come back to this course to review. Barbara Oakley you are an amazing person and you encouraged me to give collage another try despite my learning disabilities.

You get to learn about the what happens inside your brain when we try to learn a new thing, how it is moved into your long term memory.
I found the simple tools and techniques like pomodoro, testing breaks very useful.

Realeal mindshift here for me is to star using breaks and rewards. Never even thought about it and that was such an insight on the course. Thank you for all the materials. Its' toally worth of psending time learning how to learn. 
2021-01-29 00:00:00,Paul T,5.0,0.0,"It was a good course, I enjoyed it and gained insights and practical guidance on how to improve my own learning. I really enjoyed the supplementary interviews, especially those at the end of the course, and would recommend that future students be encouraged to watch them. I'd like to congratulate the professors and extend my thanks to the whole team."
2020-09-29 00:00:00,Sujatha R,5.0,0.0,This is one of the most powerful courses I completed. It practically changed the way I look at learning and has kindled in me a fire for life long learning.

During studying this course often I wondered why there was no course like this during my school/college days. Better late than never for me :). Do take this course. Thanks a lot to the course creators for creating this superb, very relevant course. 
"
2020-05-05 00:00:00,Faisal S M S,5.0,0.0,A doorway to understanding your mind from the learning perspective. I do not think that this course is only for students who are trying to acquire new knowledge but this course is for everyone who understands the value of learning new knowledge in our personal and professional lives. In general this course is a must for people from all walks of life.
2020-02-02 00:00:00,Mart V,5.0,0.0,"In just 4 quick weeks the course provides techniques, explanations and encouragement to improve in your intellectual development. The mandatory content of the course is only around 8-10h of videos. That is much less than binge-watching a season of your favorite show on Netflix. Make yourself the gift of going through this course. You won't regret it."
2018-04-06 00:00:00,Yashovardhan M,5.0,0.0,"I would recommend this course to everyone including working professionals. This course is not limited only to learners of a course of studies. The concepts are extremely useful and I already see terrific self-improvement in my work and learning. Thanks to Coursera for hosting such a wonderful course. Last, but not the least the trainers were awesome."
2016-09-30 00:00:00,giovanni c r,5.0,0.0,"Considero que el curso es espectacular, sobre todo en función de técnicas de estudio e ideas generales para cambiar la forma de ver el proceso de aprendizaje.
Por otro lado es interesante ver que dentro de las cosas que uno puede lograr como estudiante, es dormir, descansar, buscar otros espacios de aprendizaje y siempre estar dispuesto para aprender. "
2016-03-02 00:00:00,Keone S,5.0,0.0,"
This should be taught to everyone at High school. I believe I learnt a lesson not only about my capability to learn anything I want, but a lesson that can easily be transferred to many areas of my life. Thanks coursera! I am finding ways to share the principles with my students ... its the least I could do to give someone a chance to succeed in life."
2015-08-16 00:00:00,Paulo V B e A,5.0,0.0,"Learn How To Learn is a very awesome MOOC, that contributes to enhancing skills to learn in a more natural way, whatever wanted to learn. It made a bridge between the scientific finds and the normal human being like those of society, whose, ultimately, should always be the goal of any scientific research worldwide.

2020-11-18 00:00:00,Natalie Y,5.0,0.0,"This course has gave me some insights which I was initially unaware of.

2020-04-18 00:00:00,Kerem A,5.0,0.0,"Short, easy to digest and although much of the information was known to me in some form or another, it is still very helpful to gain understanding as to why I show certain behaviour. I wish I had known about this when doing my degrees, as I am sure I would have had done a better job of engraining much of what I have learned into my long term memory. "
2019-08-13 00:00:00,André F O,5.0,0.0,"My only disappointment with this course is that I haven't take it prior to enter University. I feel like my studies would have been much more efficient and I would have retained much more knowledge from the classes and books! Anyway, this is a wonderful course that has taught me a lot about I could improve my studies and be much better at my career."
2018-08-23 00:00:00,Sam T,5.0,0.0,"This is a great course and I wish something like that was taught in universities, better yet in schools. In fact, I think it's embarrassing that learning techniques aren't a part of official education. The course is presented very well and has tonnes of very useful information for anyone who's trying to overcome procrastination and learn new skills."
2018-04-22 00:00:00,John M,5.0,0.0,"This is a really good course. I'm over 50 years old now, with a successful career in science and IT, but even so I wish someone had sat me down when I first started studying and given me these tools. They are non-intuitive but very effective, and I really appreciate the effort from the instructors in passing on this life-changing knowledge for free."
2018-03-21 00:00:00,Chris D,5.0,0.0,This course should be absolutely mandatory for students looking to further their education past Middle School. The professors present sound and earnest methods of using one's entire mind to his or her advantage. We even learn how to use our disadvantages to our advantage! This is simply a perfect course for learning the finer points of how to learn.
2017-04-24 00:00:00,Sohil L,5.0,0.0,"It was very informative and really helpful. I am a serial procrastinator and I found techniques to tackle procrastination very effective. I'm going to apply those techniques in my life. 
Moreover, I found the teachers very good in explaining the concepts. I would love to see them teaching more courses here. 
Thank you for designing such a cool course! "
2016-10-05 00:00:00,Connie H,5.0,0.0,"
Excellent course, a 'must' for students or anyone attempting to learn and retain information. I recommend the course and the book, A Mind for Numbers, to students routinely and use some of the information in workshops on study skills and test-taking. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn and retain information more effectively."
2015-08-11 00:00:00,Shubham D,5.0,0.0,"It is a great course esp for aspiring students, teachers (who in turn can teach their students) and parents. I wish these things are imparted and drilled in students at a much earlier age. I knew most of these things but by accident and over a long period of time. Brilliant course - you can even download or see all videos in 1 go like a documentary."
2021-04-24 00:00:00,Bernard N,5.0,0.0,"Taking this course is an investment on your future. It will help anyone who wishes to learn new skills learn more effectively. Here, you learn how to learn everything else, and I think thats amazing on its own. Im sure my learning problems wont bother me as much as I get more familiar with what Ive picked from here. Its a great course for everyone."
2020-10-02 00:00:00,Ashley C,5.0,0.0,Taking this course (before you take courses in the subject matter that interest you) is a no brainer!

2020-03-07 00:00:00,Nicole S,5.0,0.0,Amazing course. I'm not currently studying for tests or a degree but found the neuroscientific background and learning strategies extremely interesting and helpful for all kinds of situations where we grapple with new information. And I particularly love the references and further reading suggestions that accompany each module for future reference. 
2019-05-21 00:00:00,Nawal H A,5.0,0.0,"  Whether you are a student in a school or in a college, in my opinion, we all are students in this life. To continue producing creative solutions, we need to stay in connection with ourselves by learning. Learning How to Learn has immensely widened my horizons on how capable a human being is towards his/her mental abilities. Totally recommending it!  "
2019-01-11 00:00:00,Raj N,5.0,0.0,"This course though light and breezy is full of very useful and surprising insights into how the brain works and how we can use simple practical techniques to learn and understand things better.

2017-05-13 00:00:00,Steve W,5.0,0.0,"
Very helpful and approachable. The book is an excellent complement to the course (not surprising since the course is based on the book). (""A Mind For Numbers"" is the book title).
It is worth reviewing the course materials periodically (better: build your own spaced repetition flash cards!) because it's information you'll want to hang on to for life!"
2016-11-17 00:00:00,Ahmed R,5.0,0.0,"This is one of the best course I have ever taken, maybe I have taken this course when I was a kid so I had not to struggle this much to learn. It tells me how to control procrastination, how memory works, how to think, how to learn, How exercise contributes to our learning and much more. Course has ended but I would always be a part of this course."
2016-03-14 00:00:00,Jeanne C,5.0,0.0,"I loved this course and keep referring to it in conversations with friends and work colleagues.  I could not possibly say (sing?) enough praise about it.  This course got me to start studying the German language again and relit the desire to finally finish that last research paper needed to complete my degree in Anthropology.  Thank you, thank you!"
2015-08-28 00:00:00,Kashi V S,5.0,0.0,I have been only into the preview week and the course is amazing. It has given me amazing insights and helped me understand my thinking patterns. Now I understand why my brain thinks the way it thinks. The rest 4 days have been wonderful. I am able to take control of my thought pattern and learn a lot. Looking forward to the complete course. Thanks 
2021-09-10 00:00:00,Bryan T,5.0,0.0,"This was a great course to learn how to learn. It goes over many important topics such as studying, chunking, memory, sleep, exercise, study methods, and test tips. The videos are short (less than 10 minutes) and the quizzes aren't too difficult if you are paying attention. I recommend this course for anyone who need or want to learn how to learn."

The supplementary interviews are often interesting and the reading lists offer a great way to look into the research grounding the course more carefully.  Toward the final week or two of the course, the organization gets a little mushier and the lessons can feel a bit more like a 'grab bag.'"
2017-08-26 00:00:00,Ronald F,5.0,0.0,"This course was wonderful and the lessons will stick with me for a lifetime. The course itself  was well designed and the summary questions and weekly quizzes effectively reinforced what was taught in the videos. I read Barbara's companion book ""A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel At Math and Science"" as I took the course. Each reinforced the other."
2020-09-17 00:00:00,Triana L,5.0,0.0,"Awesome techniques that will follow and guide you not only throughout your academic years, but in every aspect of your life as well.

This is a course I intend to review over and over again as it will serve a critical tool for lifelong learning. I believe it should be adapted into a Learning 101 program at the elementary education level.  "
2017-07-31 00:00:00,Andrew H,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed this course, the information provided was clear and to the point. My attention was held which i dont find many courses can. I will hopefully remember to put all these new learning's into practice in my everyday life.

Thank you Barbara!"
2016-01-28 00:00:00,Liliana H,5.0,0.0,"It has been one of the most useful courses for me.

However, I find this course was the most useful and interesting for me."
2015-12-15 00:00:00,Ioana A,5.0,0.0,"Amazing. So much useful information, so well structures and presented and also keeping a young and happy spirit throughout the materials. (you will understand what I mean)

Puts you at ease that its all too common for us to not always comprehend everything that is presented to us even if it's in a course structure.

2021-05-20 00:00:00,Lisa W,5.0,0.0,"There's always room for improvement. Harboring the notion, you're above learn new information, is counterproductive. This can impede success, in more way than many.
This course helped me with self discovery. In addition, provided effective ways I can study, with  proven learning techniques, and better test taking skills, than I previously had.

That should tell you how useful and valuable the information is, and how good of a teacher Barbera Oakley is.

I'm also terrible at names, unless they're repeated often."

I was cautious about this course, but now, after completing it, I highly recommend it. "
2022-03-24 00:00:00,Ruth L A,5.0,0.0,"It is an excellent course, excellent instructors.
