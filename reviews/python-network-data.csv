2018-04-01,Anthony S,1,129,"So far courses 1 and 2 have been great with excellent explanations. I have no idea why, but that all changes for this course. The explanations are lacking and I'm left super confused. I ended up passing this class, but I feel I didn't get a good grasp and would need to take another ""access web data"" like class to actually have a grasp, even a basic grasp at that. This course should be revisited with better explanations.

2016-07-22,Christian W,1,97,"Unfortunately on the whole I was very disappointed with this class. I took the first two Python courses and found them manageable, but this third one was an unrealistic increase in difficulty from the previous two. I reached out for help on the discussion board a number of times and saw many others were struggling as well. Mentors who responded to some of the other students were clearly getting defensive when those students were getting nowhere on the assignments. I think this program should reevaluate itself so students such as me can keep up with the assignments. On average I was spending about 10 hours per week just on the syntax for building the programs.
 
A little about my background: I have 20 years of experience in the private sector and am currently an analyst in cyber security. I have an undergraduate degree in finance, an MBA, and another master’s degree in Data Analytics. This 5 course program has been described and sold as beginner level, and given my background I should have handily been able to complete it, but that was definitely not the case. Normally I don’t leave feedback unless I feel strongly about something, so I hope you take it seriously. Thanks."
2019-06-15,Daniel H,1,49,"The assignments often go way beyond what is taught in the lectures or book. There was not a single assignment that I did not have to rely on reading tons of extra info from Overstack or other coding sites. I don't mind if the course is challenging, but it's challenging not because it's extremely difficult, but rather because it is testing things that weren't taught. "
2020-02-29,Wenjing L,5,47,"This third course is getting much more difficult than the first two courses, and sometimes I have to ""just remember including that code and it will work"" instead of understanding the whole thing. This makes it difficult for me to locate my bugs, since I don't know if it's the problem of the logic or the problem of my code structure.
The assignments are hard, but they are also easy, because we only need to change a little part of the sample code to get the answers. I don't think it can really challenge students and push us to understand better, because even if I finished all the assignments, I still feel a little confused.
But anyway, Dr. Chuck is such a good illustrator as always, and I just hope he can expand a little more so that it can be less confusing.
I have a few suggestions:
1. Starting from the 2nd course in this series, maybe the first assignment of installing python or posting pictures on forums for students for feedback can be changed into OPTIONAL because most of us who have this course have completed the former courses, and those are repeated workload.
2. The assignment sample code for WEEK 5 is wrong! The code provided is for week 6, and that CONFUSED ME A LOT! Please change that asap.
3. The assignments can be a little more variable, because although they are difficult enough(regarding students have to understand the concepts), they actually bring little help for students to understand the structures better. We only need to change so little a part in the ending part of the sample code, and it will work.
4. Some questions in the quizzes are too tricky and unnecessary for the course material. Like who invented what language? That shouldn't be a thing we should recite. Maybe the quiz questions can focus on more of the understanding of the concepts.
Thanks for reading."
2019-07-22,Sumit K,1,42,This course was horribly explained. The XML and JSON chapters just went over my head. I had to go to youtube for better and logical explanations. Feels like the instructor is in a hurry to finish the course content and do something else in his life
2018-12-11,Raquel R G,2,22,"Doing this course is not so much related to Python but to other computer engineering topics.
Network concepts are required, as well as knowing other programming languages such as HTML, XML or JSON, API or WebServices. Assignments require parsing webpages in HTML, XML or JSON, so knowledge of the same is needed. I would not pursue this course unless having strong knowledge about those topics
It is offered as part of a certification for people that know nothing about programming, so between course 2 and 3 there is a huge conceptual gap (going from loops, if-else and defining variables to HTTPS protocols, JSON and Service Layers). Keep your expectations right
 "
2018-01-09,Alan M R,2,20,"
As an experienced programmer, I am unimpressed.  The assignments cover a good set of tools; web i/o.  I would introduce classes before getting into web i/o; this would emphasize critical coding habits of productive programmers: modularity and reusability.  Also, variables and files are poorly named.  Comments are lacking.  The exercises don't ask students to program; they ask students to tweak (at most) the example programs.  Students are instructed to disable security features without sufficient discussion of the risks involved.  Overall, the presentation looks rushed and unpolished.  Code looks like it was hobbled together until it worked and never edited for clarity.  If someone I cared about wanted examples of good programming, I would tell them to avoid this."
2020-04-24,Dagart A,5,18,Great course. The lectures are clear and thorough. The assignments are challenging yet doable. The only thing I would like is to see more assignments to get more practice with the techniques learned.
2019-07-13,Piyush J,3,17,"well this was a good course though but I didn't feel very connected with web services i.e. I couldn't understand each line of code written for APIs. I didn't understand the concepts used in geojson api and twitter api completely. I would recommend to add basic explanation about these as I was not able to write codes myself that are illustrated in the course. So that's the place where I lost connection with the course as these concepts are not explained at beginner level programmers who are listening terms like API, SOA, JSON, XML, Web Scraping etc first time. So please elaborate these topics more simply and in detail so that we can understand each line of code."
2019-06-06,Alexander B,5,15,"Getting a bit more challenging than the earlier courses in the specialization.  The exercises require more struggle, but all the information is there.   Another step along the way.  Thank you, Dr. Chuck!"
2019-08-04,Ali A,1,15,"The course was great, but the teaching staff was so rude and mean to me. "
2019-12-11,Hank L,2,14,"NOTE: I am taking this course as a professional looking to move from Excel (which I have a high level of experience with) to Python. It is entirely possible that this course perfectly suits the needs of a person who has taken programming classes before and can fill the gaps, but it was not well suited for someone in my position. Below is my review of course #3 of the Python for Everybody certificate program. 
Let me start by saying that much like the University of Michigan football team, this course is highly reviewed at the onset, starts off well, and falls apart near the end. 
The class does a good job of covering basics on a topic, but expects one to bridge the gap between learnings with steps not covered (or barely touched on) in the program. This is likely due to an effort to keep the videos manageable in length, as I have yet to come across one longer than 20 minutes. However, this attempt at brevity causes much to be missed in execution; many students post the same questions to the online forum for help, which leads one to believe that crucial steps were missed or overlooked by the majority of students. I routinely find myself passing the 10-question quiz on the first attempt, but then not understanding what the assignment is asking me to accomplish. This results in me making wild guesses at the code and re-watching hours of content for a throwaway sentence that holds the key to the problem at hand. 
To summarize, the videos seem to prepare the user for the end-of-chapter quiz, but the assignments are far detached from the learnings of the video and textbook. This course might be well suited for someone who has used Python or other languages in the past and wants to take a course to refine their skills. If you're a professional looking to learn Python for the first time, you're better off buying a book that provides the answer to an exercise with step-by-step rationale for the process (something the author's textbook does not do, unfortunately). "
2019-11-01,Zach A,3,13,"Great up until Week 5 & 6. Probably needs to be a 7 or 8 week class at least. Some assignments basically require you to have previous programming experience, or else you will likely find yourself browsing the web looking for guidance and help."
2019-08-05,KAPIAMBA K F,1,12,"Horrible course, it should not be part of this specialization!!!!!"
2019-04-08,Greg C,4,11,"Great material, but it feels a bit rushed, covering as many topics as it does, in such a short amount of time."
2020-06-19,Sean M,5,10,This course was really interesting and did a good job introducing complicated topics in usefully simplified form. It was a pleasure to listen to the instructor and I got everything I wanted out of it.
2019-09-06,Hanaa A K,2,9,I'm not confident I know how to write the code alone without copying and pasting from an existing code. I am also not sure I understand what REST is.
2020-04-15,AI,1,9,The course fails to teach anything. The concepts r introduced well but the coding part comes out of no where. Coding part should've been taught systematically considering people have no prior knowledge in web data. 
2020-05-18,Arafatur R,2,8,"Well being a graduate of CSE course 1 & 2 of this specialization were fairly easy to me and fun to learn. But, this one in the last 2 weeks kept me scratching my head about what's going on here. The assignments were too hard or too easy at the same time. Why hard?? Because, too much was covered in the week 5 and week 6 and clear explanations weren't given. I found most assignments too hard at the beginning and then too easy afterwards because I ended up copying the supplied source codes and tweaking them to get the job done. I didn't write most parts of the codes like in the first two courses. I completed the course quite easily but I doubt how much I've actually learned. Most parts of the source codes I've submitted is still a mystery to me. I don't  understand each line of code I've submitted which I think I should when I've completed the course."
2020-05-04,Wilson W,2,8,"Previous courses seem better constructed and maintained. A glaring error was that the Week 6 quiz asked several questions about REST, but this was not covered in the material at all. Many other students have pointed this out on the forum several months ago. It looks like REST was removed from the syllabus, but not from the quiz. It would be good if they corrected this, as I went through all the course material again trying to figure out what I had missed."
2020-05-25,Rameses,1,8,"This course does introduce the beginning student to the web access aspects  albeit in a rudimentary manner. This could have been a very informative and educational course but it was tarnished because of several shortcomings and errors.  
 
Pros 
------ 
If you have not done any form of web-based programming or not familiar with that technology, this course does introduce a beginning programming student on the rudimentary aspects of accessing web data using Python. You will learn techniques such as creating sockets, connecting to a host and retrieving web pages as well as related third-party products that help you understand what's going on behind the scenes 
 
Cons 
------ 
1. The course presents complex code with no comments and no explanation of the more complex functions. You come away with a empty feeling of not having understood everything that you have learned. And that includes the assignments which use code provided by the instructor 
 
2. The topics regarding XML and Json structures and access methodologies could have been explained in more detail. Chuck went over his code without explaining some of the key points which I had to discover on my own. Extremely challenging for newbies 
 
3. I felt the assignments were confusing and not very challenging. I realize this is a beginner's course and therefore the level has to be kept down but I felt that a couple more (optional if necessary) assignments for some of us who want to delve deeper into this area would have been more educational 
 
4. As far as some of the technology described in the course and the sample code provided for web scraping twitter info, what can I say....except that it was DISASTROUS! Chuck talks about using telnet to access web servers. But most of the students did not understand the concepts as was evident from the innumerable questions for help. It seemed like the teaching staff themselves were ill-prepared to answer telnet questions or perhaps thoroughly frustrated as evinced in their curt replies and a burning desire to skip questions related to telnet. This spiraling of telnet-related questions became so heavy that one of the mentors finally put the topic to eternal rest by stating...""I am going to close this thread because telnet has been deprecated since the videos were made and there is no reason wasting time on an obsolete method."" All very well said, but all this frustration and anguish for both students and mentors about such an ""obsolete"" technology could have been squarely avoided had this topic been removed or a warning note placed. Same for the twitter code samples provided in this course, which did not work because of structural and policy changes implemented by twitter. Not the instructor's fault though. 
 
5. Another frustrating experience was the lack of help provided for those who posted questions on the socket programs provided by the instructor. The programs were written for a MacOS environment and the exact same code fails miserably in a Windows environment. Sometimes the students make mistakes in typing the code, sometimes they are behind a firewall/proxy server which results in a run-time error. There have been innumerable posts about the socket errors faced by many students. It would have been helpful for the students to understand what they did wrong.  One mentor, Tamara Brunnock, the teaching staff for this course cleverly sidesteps the original problem by a standardized cookie-cutter response ""Try using Chrome Developer Tools instead"". This exact phrase has been used in at least 30 responses and variations of this phrase in other responses. This tool is in no way related to the original Python program and does not help the student understand what went on in the program or how to understand the error. If a teaching staff member can respond to a legitimate student complaint on a programming problem by directing them to a third-party tool instead of addressing the original problem, it does not speak well of this course.
 
I would have given this course a higher rating but after all the frustrations I encountered, the lack of adequate help from the staff and a lack of explanation of concepts used in the lectures have left me unsatisfied and unhappy with having spent big bucks on this course. This course needs a lot of upgrading to newer technologies and dissolution of obsolete technologies and non-functional code that is provided. 
 
By all means take this course but be prepared for a frustrated, time-consuming experience.  
 
"
2015-11-22,Dario R,5,7,"Excellent introduction into accessing and scraping web data with Python.
Professor Chuck is very good at explaining things and the code snippets provided were just enough to get you started on your own.
Previous experience in Python is required. If you are coming from the first four Python for Everyone courses, you will find this one a noticeable step up in difficulty. This course uses Python 2 but I personally did all the code in Python 3 – it's possible, but be prepared to make changes and look up differences in modules between 2 and 3.
My co-students were also really helpful on the forums, although the rule not to post your source code makes trouble shooting difficult and laborious.
The one thing I found missing was the professor instructing and engaging you more on how to read and make use of documentation. It's a core skill for a programmer! With all the Python modules used in this course (Beautiful Soup, ET, XML, JSON) you are bound to come across situations where reading the documentation will open up many new pathways and enhance your understanding.
All in all a fun learning experience. Would recommend. A big thank you to Dr. Chuck & all the visible and invisible staff members who made it possible."
2019-05-13,Karunamoorthy M,5,6,"One of the Great Course on web Data Accessing through Python.
Thank you for your friendly teaching method."
2016-04-29,Vaughn P,5,5,"  Dr. Charles Severance is by far the best Computer Science professor out there!!!  I've done a significant amount of online Computer Science courses -as well as classroom courses back in college - and not one professor has been as fun and easy to understand as Chuck.  He puts presents every topic in such a way that you're never scared off thinking ""i'll never understand this stuff.""  He make computers and everything technical make sense.  I've basically binge-watched almost every lecture/course he's headed up.  
I've always been a little embarrassed to say I code in Python when talking with professional Developers.  I just thought it was an entry level language with limited capabilities.  Now i'm proud to say i code in Python.  I can't believe i can develop my on web browsers now.
He makes learning fun and seems like he's be a really fun guy to get to hang with.  Thanks Dr. Chuck for your love of teaching, you're the best!  "
2019-07-05,赵泽民,5,4,The course materials provided are very clear and useful.
2021-02-17,Evgeny K,5,3,"When I was about to start this course after the introductory ones, I was a little upset by the reviews I spotted. The average rate of this course is high, yet the ""most useful"" reviews are negative. Maybe because of this, my own opinion about the course is ""well above expectations"". I will try to address most common points of criticism from other reviews, and hope this helps future students to make a decision.
First, it has been claimed that the difficulty of this course is so much higher than in the previous two courses of specialization. I would not say so. Surely, it is more difficult, since it is expected that the students progress as they learn, but I have not felt that the material was enormously sophisticated. Also, the ""entertainment"" pieces have made a good deal of pushing the brain to relax. 
Then, it has been argued that the stuff in the forums is not polite and does not want to help, mainly making fun of the students. To tell the truth, I have not used forums much. I have asked one question and looked at about 20 most recent conversations at random. I have to say that I noticed noting rude in the stuff replies. In contrast to many other courses I have attended, the forum is alive, which is great! I have received a polite and comprehensive answer to my question in just about 4 hours, amazing! One thing is that the stuff is extremely attentive wiping out the code of the assignments and preventing discussions spoiling correct quiz answers. This may seem ""rude"" to somebody loving to have the assignments partially disclosed in the forums - but guys, we are not for cheating here.
Finally, I will cite some reviews. ""Some assignments basically require you to have previous programming experience""; ""If you're a professional looking to learn Python for the first time, you're better off buying a book that provides the answer to an exercise with step-by-step rationale for the process""; ""There was not a single assignment that I did not have to rely on reading tons of extra info from Overstack or other coding sites."". ""The explanations are lacking and I'm left super confused.""
I would say - nothing personal, everybody has its own opinion, and impressions can be different. But these seem incorrect _to me_. Yes, this course does require some prior programming skills - but this is course 3 in the specialization, and previous courses are intended to get the required experience. As for the book - I cannot imagine number of pages (guess would be thousands) to cover every bit of access to each type of web data step by step from scratch. The same about lack of details. Come on, you cannot expect learning, say, XML at the level sufficient to apply for a job after 30-60 minutes of lectures! This is enough to give an impression and possibly guide the students in future courses choice, but not to start as a professional programmer. Moreover, I am not sure I will need to parse json a lot, and I would be unhappy to have a separate course on this. Yet, it is good to know that such thing exist not to be confused facing it, and the lectures in this course are perfectly suitable. As for the assignments being poorly related to the in-class material... Well, I would say I have been upset by the _presence_ of too detailed ""working examples"" preceding the assignments! I ended up with making my assignment first and then watching the example to possibly find some drawbacks in my work. And I have never used anything besides the examples provided in the textbook and python documentation to pass the assignments.
Ok, I feel that I have written too much already. The last point is about the amount of assignments. During the previous courses it seemed to me that there could be more of programming tasks - 1 or 2 per week is not enough to cover, say, lists, which is essential to whatever you use Python in future. (On the other hand, since we have learned the basics, a lot of calculus tasks are available to us for practice on our own) Well, as for _this_ course, I feel that the assignments are just fine. I cannot claim that I can solve some arbitrary json or xml issue - but if I need, I have gained proper basement to learn the necessary details and features and to understand tutorials.
Hope this helps future students whether they enroll in this course or no. "
2017-07-03,Kaida Z,5,3,"This course is great to introduce you to regular expression, HTML, XML and JSON. Based on this course, you may dive into many other materials to further learning how to use python to access web data."
2016-03-04,Matt M,1,3,"Took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse, unfortunately. I'm wondering if I can get my money back. "
2019-12-31,Hakan T,1,3,  Horrible TAs. They should all be changed. They are extremely rude and annoying.

2018-11-30,Misha S,1,3,Time wasting & rubish
2015-12-22,J A M,5,2,"Yet another excellent course... My prior reviews were so ravingly positive that I now feel compelled to offer a very minor area of potential improvement:  Dr. Chuck might have considered going a bit deeper into Geojson API and perhaps even done a second API.  Also there were some glitches in the Geojson assignment:  My python Spyder was left frozen a couple times before I got things working.
I understand that some students would have complained due to the length of Week 6, but if you requested the simple first assignment completion after the first 10 minutes of video lecture, you could have snuck in two concrete API assignments later on.  Also, you could have had a Week 7 with the second API and alternate Web Access assignments.  In sum, I was left wishing I had a bit more API experience.
Nevertheless, I give this class 4.75 stars, which rounds up to the usual 5 stars.  I've completed three of Dr. Chuck's classes and I'm on the fourth.  Dr. Chuck is the incarnation of the super MOOC professor.  Long live Dr. Chuck!"
2019-10-29,Michael O,5,2,"Disclaimer: If you're taking the Python for Everybody Specialization, I HIGHLY suggest starting the Python 3 Programming Specialization (also University of Michigan) after completing the first two courses. Get to Week 2 of Course 1 in that specialization and then start Course 3 of Python for Everybody.

I really appreciate the University of Michigan and the staff involved in providing these courses.I completed the first two courses of Python for Everybody and started the Python 3 Programming Specialization (another University of Michigan specialization) before taking this course.Unlike the first two courses in this specialization, I do not feel like I've committed the code to memory. Especially when it comes to XML. I can comfortably talk someone through the steps of working with XML/JSON, but would likely need to look up the syntax to code it (which I hope was the intention of the course)."
2021-03-29,Miguel A V C,5,2,"I had low expectations for this course as the most helpful reviews complained that content was rushed and assignments were difficult. However, I found this course really enjoyable and easy. I think that people is complaining because they were spoon-fed too much on courses 1 and 2 of this specialisation. I only had to look for help on the forums once, and to be honest the teaching staff is a wee bit unhelpful and often confuses people more.
 My background:  I started python from scratch with this specialisation and only have 20 months of experience in programming with MATLAB."
2017-09-13,Avisek G,5,2,"The course teaches the basics of how to interact with the internet using Python. The course is simple, well explained, has great interviews with people who were part of the creation of the internet."
2019-07-07,Ichiro H,4,2,"Great course for introduction to parse Web Data. However, google map and twitter API seems to be changed a lot, so those examples won't work any more. It took me a few days to figure that out and felt a bit stressful. Hope re-recording take place soon so that many other students would not stuck there."
2019-05-18,Nicolas C,2,2,"I think that the average user will be overexerted by the complexity of this course after week 4. You have to consider that most participants barely have experience in programming at all and I am pretty sure that some will get lost, lose interest and definitely will not be able to reproduce this kind of web scraping for their own projects.
The step from scraping through simple HTML to using libraries and APIs was too much in my opinion."
2019-02-08,manish v,1,2,I would give 0 stars if I could
2022-04-26,Samuel M,5,1,"Overall  I really enjoyed the course and I hope to continue with the other two modules in the specialization. I would like to suggest to Dr. Severance that he try Visual Studio Code for the code editor used in the course. The IDE has plugins for a very large selection of languages including Python, but also includes Terminal which is used in place of Command Prompt. This saves always having to restart another program which some students might find really inconvenient, and is much easier to see than Command Prompt. I have a good bit of experience with an older version of Visual Studio programming in C++ and the features in the newest version of Python makes some things in C++ seem quite tedious.  I suspect that some of these features may have been added in newer versions of Visual Studio, but that is just conjecture. Thank you for the opportunity to learn Python and I look forward to continuing in Data Sciences courses, especially an Astronomy course managing large data sets."
2016-09-23,Rory P,5,1,"Professor Severance is awesome. I really like how each video is an in-depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when. I think his sense of what's important is spot on as I've already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects, the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter. The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned. I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week's material, especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more. I think more chapters on this in the book could be very helpful though."
2020-11-26,Sarvesh M,5,1,"This is the third course of Python for Everybody specialization. I love this specialization and I hope whoever took this specialization is greatly benefited by this specialization. I started with the first course which laid the foundation of my python journey. That first lecture in which we learnt the hardware of computers got me a lot more interested in computers and technology. I have to thank UMICH and Coursera for all these courses and I have to thank the instructor, Dr. Chuck for this wonderful specialization. I look forward to meet you in the next course of this specialization which is Using Databases with Python.

2020-11-19,Ayatullah K,4,1,"The first two courses needed to completed this course successfully.
I have previous experienced of programming with c++ and javascript. So this wasn't 

difficult to me. However, I have learned a lot of about web services. How to retrieve

web data with python and manipulate them. From week 1 to week 4 was, how can you

retrieve web pages, how to request a server and get back web data using some python

libraries like urllib(a python library to retrieve web page). Overall, for the assignments

you have to know programming logic a little bit. After retrieve web pages you need to work

with data. So you have to know conditon, loop, list, dict etc. All the assignments of this 

course is calculate sum or count of a list of data.



The last two weeks you will get familiar with xml and json. These two is the communication system for

service provider and consumer. How easy they communicate and exchange their data.

It uses for the service oriented approach mostly."
2022-08-11,Leonoor K,4,1,"Solid course, just like the first two. Level clearly increases from the basics, you gotta use everything you've learned so far. A shame that some of the google API content discussed has become less relevant/useful now that google has moved the data behind a paywall.
4 instead of 5 because of unclear discussion of ""REST"" in the final week. It isn't discussed in the actual lecture videos or discussed in the book, yet is brought up in the quiz. Repeated confused questions in the the discussion board (plenty of which are years old at this point) have not changed this. 
A big shame that the staff in the discussion often seems frustrated with the students, making their answers less than helpful, even rude. Perhaps the team is too small or the workload to heavy? Given the price of coursera I would expect better."
2022-04-22,Jasper L,4,1,"Love you Dr. Chuck, your course is amazing. But I think I do not quite understand some of the sophisticated terms like serialization. If you can add some analogies it would be perfect!"
2020-07-19,Bhuwanesh N,4,1,This course is very good except the API part. I think they must upgrade this part and elaborate this concept.

2020-08-28,Juan D L L,3,1,"I think the integration between extracting data from local documents (2nd course) to extracting data from web documents (this course) was awesome. I have some experience managing JSON and HTML syntax, and I had no problems on the assignments. However, the course's covering REST and APIs were rushed, and I think the assignments were not that challenging, because they could be done by modifying the last lines of the provided sample code (I recommend writing all the code by yourself).
If you want to have full understanding of the concepts involved in this course, you have to research A LOT. But, as Dr. Chuck said, the goal here is to at least tell you that that stuff exists."
2015-11-18,Alexander C,2,1," Compared to other Python Courses I have taken this is course has no meat on them bones and is NOT worth $80 at all even for a certificate. However for FREE? ok. Worth the introduction to some useful tools. Spend your time and money on a more valuable course like Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, which is awesome, and is about the same price as of this writing.
This course offers no challenge, little content, and the assignments let me down. Assignments are basically handed to you where you only need to alter one line of text to get the right answer on what is supposed to take an hour.
Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python thru Rice U has content and weekly mini projects that really push your learning ability and after taking the courses, I felt like I really got something out of it. 
This course barely scratches the surface of ""Accessing Web Data"" and does nothing to challenge your coding skills. The positive side, it introduces you to Web API's, the basics of Beautiful Soup, and other BUZZWORDS. At least structure assignments to combine all of the efforts learned in previous chapters onto one another. 
Side note... what is the professor doing filming lectures on vacation or at lunch? This does nothing to add to the content of the course and is distracting and unprofesh.
The meaningless assignments let me down.

2019-11-07,Alexandre n M p,2,1,"After finishing this last part of this Specialisation I fell completely frustrated and agree with other feedbacks in this list. The first part of this Specialisation was really inspiring and I feel that learned a lot. In parallel to those courses, I was able to apply the knowledge acquired in the Py4e to learn Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy and I was very excited applying that learning in my own research.However, this last course, ‘Using Python to Access Web Data’ was ridicule difficult. The exercises were impossible to my knowledge and understanding. There must be something wrong, since I was able to complete the first courses. The exercises were always challenging, but I was able to accomplish them. While the first courses I was able to understand and find the sources on the readings; this last one was awfully dispersed. I simply didn’t understand the codes, the structures and how to parse the information.While I was exciting discussing and suggesting those first courses to my colleagues. Sorry, this last one I cannot recommend, since I did not understand the codes. I am really sorry for this feedback; but I know that I gave my best and I was unable to enjoy this course. Now I feel that I need to search for another course to learn how to access the web with Python."
2020-11-08,Imran H,2,1,"This assignments in this course was very difficult. It was extremely frustrating because the course content is structured in such a way that you don't get a clear idea of all the functions and we are just told to ""Do it"" because it works. There should have been much more smaller lessons or assignments to make us understand how the urllib line functions. Getting stuck at the assignments was very demoralizing. In some of the assignments I had to read codes from stackoverflow to figure out if what I was doing was right or wrong. The lessons didn't give us any clear clue on how we should approach these problems. One of the biggest obstacles we face is knowing how to look at a problem and figure out what steps we have to take. This course didn't teach us the methods to figure it out on our own. It was more of a copy/paste and modify."
2020-07-18,Josh H,2,1,"Dr. Chuck seems like a great professor and I would love to take a course with him in person if I attended the University of Michigan, but I felt I didn't really learn much due to the extremely low difficulty of assignments. Most involved literally just taking the sample code provided and modifying a few lines slightly. I guess it's somewhat forgivable given the difficulty inherent in packaging so many deep, nuanced concepts into a digestible course for the masses, but it still doesn't change the fact that I don't feel like I really learned much of anything. While in the course, I stressed out a bit over the assignments, thinking I was expected to understand all example code provided, until I realized the assignment involves changing like two lines and that's it.

2018-05-29,Yixin W,2,1,"This course is really really challenging if you only took the first two courses before this. The tests are quite hard to get. there are many moving pieces and it is hard to know where to begin with. I tried very hard to understand the lectures but i would say it just doesn't help with the tests. 
I wouldn't recommend to beginners like me. but if you know python for a while maybe that's another story. "
2018-06-12,Sehan P,2,1,"Course is not organized properly. Enough detail is not discussed for some parts. Especially for the parts on Beautifulsoup.

2021-10-13,Abitofeva,1,1,"1. The violation code is not set and guaranteed with clear or fair instructions. Basically if your coding does not meet their answer, they just make the judgement that you are CHEATING and COPYING while unable to figure out which part is a violation. Frustrating and not understandable at all.

2. Tamara Brunnock is not a good fit for this TA position, suggested from a student perspective. when my homework is flagged by violation, he is totally rude, doing nothing helpful but keeps denouncing my inappropriate cheating behaviours. Literally ruined my experience. I’ve reviewed Tamara’s comments on others, how come that a TA describes someone’s homework as a JOKE while they just made a simple mistake of uploading wrong images? The rudeness and ignorance are totally unacceptable. Get someone qualified with basic manners to assist with the course please!
3. Content: not going into depth and lack of clear explanation of key definition and use of specific codes. Instead of teaching you how to write code, they teach you how to copy and paste. Like what have been said, seems the lecturer has something more important to do so he needs to rush over it.

2016-11-27,Stephen I,1,1,"I thought the content layout for Courses 1 and 2 were okay. However, when I got to Course 3: Using Python to Access Web Data, I was extremely disappointed. This specialization is advertised as one does not require programming experience. Course 3, however, introduces a variety of computer science topics that I believe cause information overload for a beginner. A student is bombarded with information about regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, web sockets, URLs, HTML, XML, JSON, and APIs. In fact, the video lectures spend the majority of the time explaining these concepts, while spending very little time explaining how to use Python to access web data. The corresponding book, Python for Informatics, was of little help understanding the assignments. Like the videos, the book lacks sufficient numbers of examples. The few examples that are given lack adequate explanations of the code they contain. I found myself on many occasions asking, ""What exactly does this line or block of code do?"", and could not locate the answer. If not for the forum, I would not have been able to complete th
"
2019-11-22,Smit P,1,1,"Not as good as the previous courses in this specialization. There are many aspects that one needs to know before applying for the course.

1. If this is the first course you are taking before taking any of the previous courses in this spealization then you should probably think and might take the previous ones. Since this course consists of some topics that are discussed in the previous course.

2. The explanation Is too short and I felt it is rushed and not proper explanation is given in some of the topics.

3. There are some good assignments , I was able to do some of them on my own without taking any help based on the explanation and videos . While most of the assignments are difficult since proper explanation is not given . 

4. In most of the examples of solved programs instructor does not show the full detailed solution and explanation since the topics is been covered in the previous course. (The typical ""You have learnt this in your school "" so I m not repeating types)
At the end I felt that I have not gained much knowledge from this course and just completed the assignments.


"
2020-07-22,Ahmet K,1,1,"1) In the video lectures, instructor assumes that you are familiar with the subject. Even though i have completed previous courses in the specialization, most of the time i was very unfamiliar with the subjects that i have been assumed to know.   
2) Most of the time instructor is going out of subject and it is being very distracting for not native speakers. I am having hard time understanding the content and then realize that he is speaking about sth. irrelevant.  
3) since video lectures are not covering all, you will have hard time understanding the content if your background is not CS. So when you are having hard time to understand the content Instructor trying to make unfunny jokes will annoy you. 
I liked first two courses of specialization and hopeful about last two... but this one is below average."
2021-06-28,Zong Y N,1,1,"We are encouraged at the start of the course that we can read up external materials to understand the context better. But during the assignment, when we wrote codes not exactly taught in the course - it was considered as ""copying from the internet"". Moreover, one assignment was believed to have incorrect content that render my assignment failed. After raising it in the discussion forum, my assignment been accepted suddenly, I have yet to receive any conclusion on what went wrong that render my assignment failed initially. Took up alot of my time to relook on my assignments that are fundamentally correct, the so called ""copy from internet"" and the last assignment that failed because of wrong content."
2016-03-18,Kevin P,1,1,"The pedagogy of this course is disappointing because of a lack of sequential instruction. Large gaps exist: explanations of syntax and conceptualization of how the data flows seem incomplete. I have looked at all kinds of documentation as well as the book, but I cannot find what I need to know, and this a barrier to completing the assignments. The instructor's videos have shown me very little of what I need to understand the concepts. The examples show at most 20% (that is just a guess, it is probably less) of the knowledge that I need to complete the assignments. When I ask questions on the forums,  the first word I think when I read mentors' explanations is ""cryptic."" "
2017-01-29,Rick M,1,1,"This course is garbage. The instruction videos are fine, but the assignments are imprecise in their language at times, and there are certain key points needed to complete them that aren't covered in the videos. The mentor in the forums is lousy, and his responses are worded as if he's talking with a peer and not a beginner/student. 
I may or may not try another coursera course after this. But if this experience is any indication, Coursera isn't very good. The same UofM course appears over on Udemy, and I wonder if it is just being repurposed on as many platforms as possible without the care needed to make sure it works. "
2020-06-24,Hua R Q,1,1,"The rule of not allowing TAs to explain to students the answers to the quiz in the discussion area doesn't make sense at all, because the assignment itself does not give an explanation for the answers. Many students seek help after completing the quiz. If they intended to cheat, they don’t need to bother asking questions in the discussion area, because the test itself is unlimited, and they can repeat the test multiple times to get the correct answer. If there is no chance to ask questions about the quiz, how can the problems aroused in the quiz be solved?"
2016-03-02,Matthew B,1,1,"No teaching. Just a guy talking and sometimes complaining about imaginary students' hypothetical thoughts. Do the problem sets for practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.

2021-08-05,Victor D,5,0,"I often skip reading reviews of a course before enrolling as I often find ""most useful reviews"" being a bit harsh even if the average rate is near 5-stars. After I completed this course, I looked up the reviews and I was right about what I thought I was going to find.

So the first thing that has to be addressed is that it's indeed true that this course feels a lot different from the previous two ones. But that's to be expected. The first two ones are too simple and too easy, so it doesn't come as a surprise that you get the feeling that they were better courses overall (as if the explanations were better and the assignments were more reasonable), because they were about simple things that were kept inside Python just to get used to this programming language, but this course is about interacting with other applications and languages without really explaining how they work. 

But explaining what exactly XML, JSON, API's. etc. are and how they work would take at least 1 course more for each one of them. So what can you expect when just 1 course covers all of these while still teaching you the basics of Python? It makes it feel rushed but that doesn't mean that it's bad. As Dr. Chuck has explained before, this specialization is about getting used to Python, getting to know what you can do with it rather than becoming a professional, so that then you can enroll in more courses about Python or other languages and not feel like you're completely lost and this course does that job perfectly. You still get a good idea about what those things are without deeply studying those subjects.

Finall, the assignments are not just tweaking code but you also have to understand how they work, otherwise you would struggle even is most of the code is already written in the examples. You have to figure out a lot of things by yourself but it's not very difficult. You don't have to look up things on Youtube or Stackoverflow as others have stated, that's just exaggerating. Everything you need is in this course or in the provided book."
2019-05-02,kalu M,5,0,"I just finished Using Python to Access Web Data, which is the third (3rd) course in the Python for Everybody specialization. The course wasn't so easy as the previous courses in the specialization as I had to spend more time debugging and practicing, nevertheless, it was lot more fun. 

Completing and learning the coursework in this course would definitely have been impossible without the Python for Everybody team which includes the good Dr.Chuck and the mentors. There are many things I liked in this course. The discussion forums were great, the videos and slides were really cool and the mentors did great stuff like checking your code for you and other good stuffs. Becoming a programmer is subject to many constraints and the chiefest of this is the need for mentor-ship and the Python for Everybody team understands this so well.
There is just one flaw. I recommend more sample projects, more course work , more content, and more work files but this would make the course boring, last much more longer and nobody wants to grow grey hair learning python. The best way to take care of this might be to introduce an additional course. Notwithstanding,I give this course a 5-star rating and recommend it to anyone who has a thing for python and who has a good understanding of its syntax and data structures covered in the previous courses of the specialization."
2020-08-13,ashok m,5,0,"This was a great learning experience. It was tough but in the end, you feel satisfied that you worked hard and your efforts paid off. Dr. Chuck is a great teacher, content creator and an inspiring technologist. I really enjoyed, apart from the core course content, his interviews of original creators such as the WWW, JSON, at the CERN centre etc. It helped me understand and empathise with myself when I found it difficult to grasp certain concepts. 
I have one complaint though. The teaching staff (especially one Ms Tamara Brunnock) are nasty, rude towards beginner students like me and others. The discussion forums should be a courteous place to exchange thoughts and reveal your ignorances. However these teaching staff bully students with rhetorical questions. I don't know why they are teaching staff if they don't love the subject, love teaching and love interacting with students. I got zero value addition through these discussion forums. In some of these forums, there are external freelancers who help you out and that is the only help you get. 
Beyond all this quibbling, Dr. Chuck is a great instructor and my computer knowledge is solely thanks to him.  "
2020-11-02,Gabriela D,5,0,"As in the previous courses, the material was well explained and easy to follow. Dr. Severance is charismatic and makes the best of a less-than-ideal medium. 
The assignments ended up being quite fun, but the wording is not always 100% clear, which I imagine poses some problems for those whose English isn't great.
The other thing is that the assignments were always more complicated than the examples shown. In some cases, it was possible to apply what we learned; in others, it was necessary to look up how to do certain things. That's not a problem, but expectations should be more clearly communicated because people will waste hours trying to modify code they were shown only to discover that there is a very specific way of writing something. It's akin to showing someone a few collocations in a foreign language and expecting them to intuitively know an idiom they've never seen before. However, for people who are barely learning how to code, assembling and adapting code is perfectly fine, as long as you understand exactly what everything does.

2019-06-01,Vikas V,5,0,"This has been an excellant designed course for everyone who is interested to become part of python  programming course.

Dr. Chuck has been an expectional trainer throught out the course material and his method of explainning the slides while parallely informing that this particular content would help you resolve the 'Grade Exrecise' later down the course is simply awesome.

Once you finish the course,you would definately be in a position to understand  from simple to medium complexity python programs.I would like to add one smart trick here ""speciality of the course and explanation is the number of times you browse through the video material,more you will increase your understanding for that particular topic.

I can't thanks coursera and Dr. chuck enough to help people learning python so effectively and efficiently and making us build python community."
2019-07-09,German H,5,0,"  I began learning Python with this course. With absolutely no prior knowledge of or experience in Python (except lots of curiosity), I came across the first two courses on Coursera.org and loved Dr Charles' videos. It's a well structured course, especially if you have just started learning about Python and wish to build your skills more practically than by mere reading of numerous resources. There are plenty of resources that Dr Chuck (as he is fondly referred to by his students) offers in the duration of the course. I especially enjoy the bonus videos that accompany this course. They really help increase your knowledge base and urge you to know and be better and try your hand at various things. I'm glad I decided to pursue the entire specialization offered by University of Michigan, and it is all thanks to Dr. Chuck!  "
2018-01-03,Aynur Z,5,0,"This is a wonderful course and a great tool to learn Python along with some obtaining some fundamental information about the Internet.The video lectures are very clear and accompanied by slides which elaborate the discussed topics. The course also presents a lot of bonus material including interviews. I love the lecturer who gives excellent explanations. My favourite moment was when after explaining the topic about the structure of the internet by a chart Dr. Charles Severance paused for a moment and breathed out heavily and said: ""Actually it is easier (the topic) than it sounds"". But, of course, his explanations were perfect, he is just passionate about transmitting the information to the students in the easiest to understand manner.And I have to say he succeeds admirably.Overall, I highly recommend this course"
2020-07-28,Omar M A,5,0,"The course was rich and I learned so many things about web scraping, some regular expressions,parsing html, accessing web data and extracting information from the web, how data is exchanged between different softwares across the web and how to manipulate and parse this data if it was xml or JSON, and a brief introduction to service oriented architecture and what's an API and how to use APIs in your application to add a certain feature.
As always, Dr-Chuck is a great and an engaging instructor and I enjoy his lectures so much!

The only thing that I wished was more clear when I began this course is the exact curriculum and the exact skills that the learner should have by the end of it. I had to do a lot of researching and to thoroughly study the text book to achieve that. Other than that everything was 10/10! "
2019-02-12,Anna R,5,0,"This course is a good introduction to various aspects of web data. It's a pretty broad overview, so no one topic gets too much focus, but I feel much more informed about working with data from various web sources—how you get it, how it's formatted, and how to work with it once you've retrieved it. Dr. Chuck is a great teacher, and the assignments help you understand the material covered in the lectures through some hands-on work. One downside to this course as compared to the previous courses in the series is that the assignments seemed to involve more direct copying of example code, and less problem solving, which means it was harder to feel that I'd really mastered the techniques. That said, the materials provided are good examples and I'm sure I'll return to them in the future."
2020-03-03,Kip V,5,0,"The comments from other students about this being maddening and difficult are fair.  There's a lot of arcane stuff in the commands needed to simply set up a connection and there are several places where it's not always clear how to get some code running (eg, twurl, oauth).  Two responses that still make the five star rating make sense:  1) the forum was actually pretty helpful in getting through some of the problems; and 2) learning how to solve problems by poking around and experimenting is part of what we need to learn.  Finally, I think the whole thing of how do you address individual elements of something returned - JSON or XML - should be a bit of a struggle.  Forced me to think, work through things on paper, and I've learned some debugging techniques. "
2016-08-11,zhe h,5,0,"First, thank you Dr. Chuck for the well-designed class.
Here are a few things that may help improve this class:
first, it might make more sense if you introduce python class or object first, then the package and method and return type will make more sense.
second, it could include more coding for scraping on the web, the examples are very limited(well, ok I understand this is a pretty introductory course....)
Last, for those who use python3, there are many thinks you should notice to make ur code work, such as from bs4 import BeautifulSoup, also notice the urllib has been split so you should import urllib.request and urllib.parse, also for those return value as byte, use decode('utf8') to convert it to strings, otherwise it will cause a lot of trouble in json"

way Dr. Chuck explains the modules. So far, this is the best programming course
I've had (certainly I haven't had many of them) and in few weeks I've learned a
lot of stuff in short time thanks to the dosage of the course and Dr. Chuck.
On the other hand, I
feel week 5 and 6 were a little bit saturated. Not a big concern.
 
I've read some of
other's reviews and I can't explain why this third part of the specialization
was too difficult. I never needed any forum's consultancies and I'm 20 years
old and this is my first programming course in my entire life. I do believe
that Dr. Chuck maybe wanted to grab so much, but is really easy to figure out
the assignments with the book, the videos, the python codes that he gave us and
so on. "
2019-07-18,Ashray G,5,0,"  As I mentioned in the previous reviews about this Specialisation, all these courses are meant for beginners without previous programming experience and the difficulty of courses rises gradually.Thus, the first course was a real piece of cake, second got a little tougher and this one is the first course that really took me some time to finish it. This time I really had to listen to some lectures twice, to debug my code a hell lot of times and to stick to the sample code a lot.Students, who have programming experience might still think that this course is too slow and easy, but it is a great way for the beginner to learn python.To sum up: great course, uprising difficulties, recommend enrolling after finishing previous courses. 10/10  "

People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web services, to solve business problems, to work with sensors, drivers and robots. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work. 



Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more 
in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. 


Py4inf and Python explained by C. Servance, is a great developing of the foundations in programming (first two courses) that will serve you well for the rest of your life, as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you.

I strongly recommend this course for anybody, who wants to start with informatics."
2017-07-18,jorge g,5,0,"This is an excellent course. Its level, its intensity, and the assignments are appropriate for people who knew nothing about programming and whose knowledge derives from the courses in this specialization. For students with this background, the time taken to read the material, watch the videos, and prepare the assignments exceeds that advertised in the course, especially the time to complete the assignments. To complete the assignment one needs to master the material and that takes time, more than to understand it, which is easy to do. The information on time spent should be corrected. I have learned much in the three courses taken so far, and expect to continue learning in the remaining two courses in the specialization.      "
2020-05-18,Benjamin S,5,0,"While Course 3 is significantly more challenging and technical than Courses 1 and 2 from the Python specialization, I found this to be the first time I truly felt that my Python knowledge was practically applied. Although parsing local text files is fine, one of my main goals with Python was learning to use it to interface with APIs in a seamless manner. I was also very curious as to how web scraping is actually performed, and I'm proud to say that I finally learned how it works. This course is very valuable for anyone who feels everything they've learned in Python up until this point is highly theoretical and indispensable for anyone looking to apply their Python knowledge in a professional environment."
2022-06-16,Jeyadarshini S,5,0,"It was a good introductory course for web applications using Python and I consider the coding assignments to be pretty challenging. It was hard to learn to be honest, consider how short the explanations are. As the XML, JSON and API concepts are not deeply detailed, the beginners can find it really overwhelming. Its because lots of background knowledge is necessary to get the best of this course. I would prefer it to be longer but still, I'm highly motivated to learn more about APIs in the forth coming days. This course has helped me to put extra effort in my studying journey. I highly recommend people to check out this course to get a hook on how web data can be accessed using Python.  "
2020-05-11,Art P,5,0,"  The quality of this Coursera specialization continues. Lots of great information about networks and how to interact with them. My interest is definitely piqued for Dr. Chuck's book, ""Introduction to Networking"" and course ""Internet History, Technology, and Security"". The programming assignments continue to be straight forward and rewarding.  As others have mentioned, the content can be a bit more challenging and technical with slightly less focus on Python than the previous py4e courses.  However, the information provides great understanding on how to interact with the internet through Python which is a very common application.  It's worth it if you're up for the challenge!"
2019-04-12,Barrie C,5,0,"Dr. Chuck again does not disappoint.  This class gets into the nitty gritty of web scraping using html, xml, JSON and APIs such as Google geo and Twitter.  A lot of the framework is given to you in the sample code, but the trick is modifying the code for the specific task they give you, so reading the book chapter and paying close attention in the lectures to how each format is structured will help you.  Also use the forum if you need to--if you have already programmed before and sailed through the first two classes in the specialization, this class may surprise you with its increased rigor but once again Dr. Chuck and his staff on the forum will get you up to speed."
2018-05-23,Xavier Y,5,0,"Excellent course, I highly recommend it. Ch. Severance is an excellent instructor, I must have said it already twice, but I can still say it again!
This course didn't make me an expert in accessing Web data, but tought me basic knowledge of what Web Services are and how to work with them in Python. Before, I have heard a bit about these concepts, but I was reluctant to using them because I didn't understand what they actually were. Now, I'm way more confident about this, and I know I'd happily delve into more advanced tutorials or courses on this topic if I needed to. This is the best profit I made from this course. Thanks a lot Dr. Chuck, see you in a next course!  "
2019-08-29,Luis W D M,5,0,"As the two first courses in the ""Python for Everyone Specialization"", this course is great. I had never done any programming in retrieving data from the web before and it was really fun being capable of learning and doing it.

However, since the lecture videos exploit a lot of the API set ups for Google and Twitter services, I expected assignments would demand these kind of things.  On the other hand, as it is a begginer's course, I thought extremely useful as my first contact in retrieving data in different formats (html, xml, json) and in understanding what an API is. 

Once again, thanks for Professor Severance and all the staff supporting this specialization!"
2016-11-15,Mir A,5,0,"I have got a very handsome introduction to the regular expressions , web services and API . The lectures are very easy to follow. It is better to answer the quizzes right after watching the vdo lectures. The questions are mostly from what has been described in the lecture. The assignments are a little more insightful. May require basic google searches to acquire knowledge of accessing the data structures. The assignments addresses rudimentary practical problems but very substantial for starters in this field of programming. Thanks to Dr Chuck. The course is very well organized and have materials to hold the attention of the person who is following the lectures. "
2020-01-04,Yashodeep P,5,0,"This course is a really good head start to know more about the web and how to parse data from the web.Dr. Chuck explained all the details very well and the assignments are comprehensive. In the initial weeks, the assignments are simple and not so complicated, but as the course advances, you will spend hours to figure out the assignment. At times this is often frustrating but once you get the final answer correct, the accomplishment makes you very happy.I really loved the course and would be looking for other material online to get a deeper knowledge on this subject.  Apart from that, I will definitely enroll in all other courses under this specialization. "
2018-07-01,Malhar B,5,0,"Great instructor, great class, and very easy to follow. I learned a LOT!My only critique, is that many times when I am trying to fully understand how some code works within the presentation, the presentation will suddenly show the instructor speaking briefly, and then go back to the code. We don't need to see Steve. When he's trying to explain how code works during the presentation, just show the code. This allows me to understand what's going on while he's still speaking. Otherwise I need to pause the video, and by that point I'm no longer focused on what he was talking about.Otherwise, this course is near perfect, and I've learned a ton from it. Thanks"
2017-02-19,Nikita N,5,0,"  Amazingly excellent course. Many thanks for Dr. Chuck for creating that. Everything explained very well, enabling doing simple steps to quickly achieving results. For those who alreay know some programming I would really recommend starting from this course and skipping the first 2 courses. Skipping means it's better to read the first 10 chapters Dr. Chucks's book through and start this course right after that. It will save your time allowing not ot do too simple tasks but just read about the Python syntax. The course is also great because of Dr. Chuck's talent to explaing everything with fun and ease. Definitely 6 stars out of 5 for the course!"
2017-02-28,Kainka,5,0,"This is not another general Python course which leaves you with an 'idea' of what can be done and you struggle to actually do it. This course is in fact giving you all the relevant tools you need and leaves you with a set of practical skills allowing you to write Python codes to extract Web Data that can be used for further analysis. Creating a web browser, screen scraping, parsing XML, or JSON are among the actual skills you're getting and this is all possible thanks to the first class lectures and materials provided by Dr. Chuck. He has a particular talent and desire to teach and explain things to you so you will understand them for good."
2020-09-20,Berke E,5,0,"   I have enjoyed learning about how I can use Python to retrieve information about websites using its JSON and XML data. I had prior knowledge of Python and Data from my data science experience therefore I think that the assignments where pretty easy to complete. I was expecting a bit harder assignments that would challenge me. The quizzes were just enough to test your knowledge about the material. I had to go through my notes before starting a quiz. Now I will challenge myself with the knowledge I have received from this course. Thank you Dr. Chuck , University of Michigan and Coursera for providing Using Python to Access Web Data course.  "
2020-06-11,Shubhankar S,5,0,"I am really grateful to the instructors especially Tamara ma'am. They have never let your morale down and keep boosting your confidence and skills. Whenever I was in trouble, those daily tips for solving the assignment always lead you to your goal closer and closer one at a time instead of giving all the hints at once for helping us understand the contents of the course. And truly I became one of Dr Chuck's fans. I was in awe of his teaching skills and it was good to hear his lectures and explaining hard concepts in a pretty satirical way.Thank you so much and I hope that Dr.Chuck and the teaching staff have seen my appreciation message."
2017-12-04,Jason J,5,0,"Dr. Chuck Severance is an excellent teacher.  Between his book and the video lectures, I feel 100% comfortable with the material.  Granted, this is still a broad overview and we didn't dive too deep (this is a good thing) into REGEX, XML, JSON, along with different libraries (urllib, beautiful soup, etc) but I'm no longer intimidated by the terms and have a great understanding of at least what they are and why there are used.  This class is a great foundation upon which one can build with further study.  I'm looking forward to finishing the database course and then continuing on the next Python Data Science track offered by UMich."
2017-10-20,Shannon R,5,0,"I absolutely loooooooove Charles. His teaching style is so clean and concise, this is clearly his divine purpose in life. The order in which the information is presented is perfect, I feel like I am finally able to make sense of how my computer actually works and does stuff on a daily basis. His passion for this material definitely translates in every lecture, which makes me excited for each new topic. I love the visualizations he includes or draws because it really gives me a grasp of how a program is working as we progress through each component of the program.  I wish he taught the data science course too.  Thank you Charles!"
2020-10-26,Denis B,5,0,"Howdy all. I'm not
  engineer, not programmer. I'm a beginner of programming, so i have small
  experience of passing courses. But i think, this course needs more
  assignments in programming to consolidate every theory in our minds,
  assignments with different levels of difficulty, including assignments with
  less amount of prompts.
But i think course is useful, don't miss it.
P.S. maybe for some beginners this course
  very hard, but i think that it isn't easy mostly for many people, when you
  learning something new in your life. Learning how to find needed information in internet is great useful experience too ;)"
2020-08-12,Sayak C,5,0,"The last week may turn out to be a bit harder than the rest and people might find it a bit more difficult than the previous courses but the devil is in the details. The are a lot of minute details that demand your attention and require to be learnt, because if you somehow miss these details or overlook the little important things, it'll become far harder to finish the assignments and weekly quizzes. As for me the simple sequence of parameters in an url was the difference between the wrong answer and the right. You'll learn a lot of stuff that requires detailed attention, every part will be requiring a lot of focus."
2021-01-17,Hikmet H,5,0,"Great course! Dr. Severance did a fantastic job, similar to what he did on previous modules. Naturally, going through the modules, difficulty level goes up and Dr. Severance is managing this very professionally. It took me less than a week time to complete first 3 modules and hopefully planning to complete rest of the modules during the upcoming week. I would rather learn any subject in a fast mode, instead of doing it in slow motion as giving days between, it takes a while to remember what you learned before. This is my personal method, which may not work in other students. Good luck to all the students!"
2016-01-05,Huynh L D,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is an exceptionally-inspiring teacher. He explains complex concepts like XML, JSON, HTTP, API, RegEx in such an eloquent and down-to-earth fashion that despite having the videos at x2.0 speed, I can grasp everything he tries to deliver. Amazing! This course, and many other Dr. Chuck's courses, are really how online courses should be. Excellent instructor, fair share of hands-on programming assignments.
However, I just hope that there are many more programming assignments, maybe many optional challenging, extensive programming assignments or even projects would be an ultimate Coursera experience."
2020-10-29,Dinesh L,5,0,"Interesting course. A few comments. 1: The example codes are helpful. However, I am not sure if I would be able to write a program from scratch using a customer specification. 2. The Twitter example is interesting and complicated. 3. How was the twURL code created? Is this something we will learn in this course? Many thanks to Dr. Chuck for sharing interview videos and great explanation of the material. The video of the lectures are good but I had to view them multiple times to really understand what is going on. Some of the explanations went too fast for me. The text of the video lectures are helpful."
2022-06-24,Mohammad M,5,0,"Introduces  how to connect to the internet using sockets for our knowledge. Then shows we have a better way of using the urllib in Python. Teaches us how to read data from websites including HTTP and HTTPS. We first use regular expressions to get the data we want, but these are too difficult and we stop using them later, especially with HTML as they are unpredicted. We then switch XML and BeautifulSoup deal with HTML websites. We eventually get to json and how it makes our life much easier, albeit XML can sometimes be required sometimes. Then we go through parsing and looking for certain data on API."
2018-05-31,Sidra F A,5,0,"There are times in this course when you would want to go and hug Dr Chuck for making it so simple and easy to understand few of the most complex concepts in language and specially for people having no prior knowledge of the subject. One gets this feeling quite often  ""keep going, you can do this, its easy"". 
Also, this will be my first ever course on coursera that I'll complete and not just leave in the middle because this is how an online course should be - doesn't waste time, has condense information in every minute of the video lectures and stays true to topics without going under/overboard. "
2020-05-22,Jenkins P S J,5,0,"The course
content is excellent.  The way of
teaching of the great Dr Chuck is very engaging. This is the third course I have
taken under him and surely, he is one of the best teachers I ever had. He
breaks down the contents into nice little pieces and presses one those areas
which are important. The assignments are a bit challenging compared to the previous
two courses and encompasses everything that are thought in the course. The bonus
contents are awesome and love watching them after doing the assignments. Overall,
as a great learning experience with Dr Chuck as it always will be."
2015-11-16,Maksym S,5,0,"I'm not exactly new to python, but my typical use-cases looked more like hacking rather then conscious programming. 
Said all this, I've found the first block - introduction to Python, to be very basic and slow paced, but starting from the Web it is all good stuff only.
It deserves to become one of the coursera classics. Great combination of pedagogical talent, humor an knowledge of the subject. It also tremendously helps that the course is backed by the book so it is always possible to look back for that ""Introduction to Python"" part, that I've skipped ;)"
2016-01-01,beliefs22,5,0,"I've taken a number of courses on Python through Coursera and this was the first course that I was able to follow through to completion, and I believe that is a combination of Dr. Chucks teaching style, and the activities he uses to convey the information. It was amazing to learn about things like using APIs and mixing python with Databases in a way I could  understand at my level of programming knowledge, and it enabled me to start thinking about my own projects in a completely new way. 
I'm really looking forward to completing the capstone project."
2016-06-06,Michael R,5,0,"This course has been a Godsend to me. I was so confused about so many things and all the other resources I could find out there just assumed that I knew things about which I was, in fact, clueless. I got the book and watched a lot of the lectures twice but in the end I really feel like I got it. The assignments were manageable and doable after the course lectures and I have gone back and done a number of them over again to solidify things in my mind. I feel like the web is my friend now, not  a source of cheap tricks and booby traps. Thanks! "
2017-06-15,Joe W,5,0,"While I'm an experienced programmer I'm relatively new to Python and had never done anything with either XML or JSON before this course. Yet here I am understanding it all and successfully doing genuinely useful things with them in Python.
There can't be that many courses that can get a beginner useful in just six sets of lessons. Novice programmers should take this at the recommended pace and do not move on until you have 100% on all assessment items. Experienced programmers should be able to complete this in a couple of days. I did. :)"
2018-10-14,Jarosław G,5,0,"I am totally new to programming. I have experience working in a technical environment 
and have a lot to do with IT in my daily job, but I wanted to learn something new. I made
different attempts to learn to programm, but all of them failed. Now, I have been doing the whole module 
of Python for Everybody (5 courses) and I am enjoying it a lot. Lectures by Dr Chuck are really insporational, well prepared and
easy to understand to a person who does not have any experience with programming.
I am becoming more and more involved into python:)."
2016-01-20,Juan O L,5,0,"I think this course is a really good overview of how to use Python to retrieve web data using the two most common data interchange formats: XML and JSON.  Not only that, but you also get a brief yet good introduction to what XML and JSON are, as well as the basics of network communication and regular expressions.  I was hoping the assignments would be a bit more challenging, but the free textbook provides additional exercises to practice with.  As always, Dr. Chuck's style helps makes this course (and his other ones) a great one."
2016-07-08,Juan D,5,0,"I learnt Python with the introductory course ""Programming for Everybody"". Then, I completed this course and it added a whole lot of tools to my knowledge. It is amazing how much you can accomplish in such a short course. The assignments are very well oriented, so by basically modifying the code you wrote for this class you can already do a lot. It also gives you a very good basic knowledge about web programming, so you can now understand and interpret many things and concepts you are seeing all the time. I recommend it a lot."
2020-07-21,AKANKSHYA N,5,0,"This course is like the cheery on the top. It makes you use the web data , you will learn about retrieving the html, xml pages and you can even search for any particular element and also can add up any element from the source page. The best part is in the last week of this course, where it teaches about how you can use APIs of googlemaps, twitter . At the end you will be able to write a program of 30 lines to just take input of any location(even some parts of it) and it will give you back complete info about it. Loving it:)"
2020-08-08,Sarfuddin A T,5,0,"Dr. Chuck  is an expert and an efficient teacher of the course. However for me his lectures were sometimes pretty fast when I had difficulty following him and its very normal in a online course. I faced difficulty mainly in the week 4 and week 5  specially webpage parsing using xmlTree where I took longer time then normal.  However Teaching staff from the course patiently provided suggestion for correctly solving the problems. 
Thanks are due to both University of Michigan and  Courera  for arranging Dr. Chucks courses."
2017-10-15,Derek O,5,0,"Great course all around, truly feel like I learned a lot! Really appreciate how Dr. Chuck takes concepts and topics that could easily get mixed up or ""over-thought"" (my bad habit haha) and orders them in a way that flows well and makes sense to the relative rookie like myself. Thanks so much for making someone who used to think he'd never be able to code feel like ""Hey I can do this stuff!"" It will make a huge difference in my career and my personal confidence. Please keep making great courses! =) - Kind regards, Derek"
2020-07-18,Mohd A N,5,0,"  This is the 3rd course of the Python specialisation that I've completed from Coursera and taught by Dr. Charles Severance. This one was far-most the most teaching centred of all the three, and now I feel I've a good command on python to write my own back to intermediate programme. I even built an Instagram video downloader with the knowledge I gathered from this course.And as always, Dr. Chuck is a really interesting instructor, plus his website is the perfect place you could simulate your learnings.Happy learning!  "
2016-10-16,Anand B S,5,0,"The Teacher made me thirsty of more work. Especially in the last chapter, I was looking for more challenging work. The way the assignment was designed and the topics were taught made me think, the assignment for the last week was quite easier and I was expecting something more challenging. This proves the beauty of this class. I wish I have a trainer like this always with me, at least as long as I cannot go out and look for work myself.
Thanks a million to Dr. Charles Severance. This is a very positive experience."
2016-03-02,Jonpaul W,5,0,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error.  However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject.  Dr. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable.  For any novice programmers looking to understand how Python can be used to access the web and scrape its data, this is the best place to start."
2018-09-13,Leonard M,5,0,"This is the 3rd course of the ""Python for Everybody"" specialisation in Coursera.While the first 2 courses were too easy, I found that things started to get more interesting with this one. We learn about Webservices, XML and JSON manipulation and web scraping with Python. The level is still easy but the teacher is engaging and the code examples are well done. With some imagination, one can easily reuse this knowledge and go to the next level.This is a good course to learn the basis of web services with Python."
2018-05-27,Vitalii U,5,0,"Excellent course as the previous Python for Everybody
courses I have taken before. It gave good understanding on how programming
languages interact with web services. On top of this it gives good introduction
to API. Examples and assignments really help not only to get theory, but ho to
use the knowledge in practice. In addition this helps better to remember the materials
of the course. Great initiative and really good introduction to programming
which could help to take more advanced courses in data science."
2017-05-08,Joseph G,5,0,"
This is a very good course. My goal from this course was to get knowledge about using python to extract data from websites and apis. I come with a business intelligence background and I found this course very useful and is definitely going to add value in my career. The professor was great and it was a pleasure to watch his videos and hear his knowledge. I will recommend this course to anyone who is interested in making use of a beautiful language (-Python) to extract data from the internet. FIVE STAR"
2017-05-31,Edward F,5,0,"I took the Python Specialization, which included this course, so I'm going to provide the same review for each of the component courses.

I think this is an excellent course for beginning programmers. Python is a great language for someone starting out - easy to learn - with a lot of power available for more advanced projects (e.g., machine learning).
But, most of all, you have to love Dr. Serverance. I can't think of a more entertaining and enjoyable person to teach programming. Thanks, Dr. Chuck.
"
2018-07-23,Аитор Х,5,0,"Wonderful course, the way Chuck explains it is the cherry on the cake that makes all the specialisation even more valuable. The content itself is really useful and a good starting point for projects that require the use of APIs. If something I wish there was a video explaining how to understand the ""def augment"" that Dr-Chuck did, referring to the ""oAuth.py"" of the twitter API but overall I'm really happy with all I've learnt and I would definitely recommend this to all curious people out there."
2015-10-30,Alan P,5,0,"Awesome.
Truly awesome.
Professor Severance (a.k.a. 'Dr Chuck') is an amazing teacher, explaining the content in a clear yet engaging way - truth is, it gives the impression of being a wonderful human being tout-court. The coding exercises are very well crafted, and show how to use tiny Python snippets to carry out heavy tasks.
So if you've never really sat down to learn regexes, or if you want to have a minimal web crawler/scraper running in less than one hour, this class might be your cup of tea."
2017-12-20,Christopher T,5,0,"Dr. Chuck's courses are great!! I am enjoying them immensely. I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Chuck in person. He is personable and engaging. Take the chance to meet him if he hosts live office hours near you. These Cousera MOOCs are easy to navigate and provide a wealth of valuable material for people at all levels. The first assignment of week 6 was the hardest yet, but following Dr. Chuck's lectures and with the help of some very wise mentors and tutors the code problems are easily solved."
2016-02-04,Venugopal A,5,0,"It was really helpful. I have 18 years of software development experience, but never learnt python and after going through this course, I could understand the power of it and how it can be used. I could learn the concepts very well and of course had to google to refresh myself, but its well organized and put together in a way we can learn easier and faster.
Thanks to Dr Chuck. Sometimes your comedy was above and beyond, but at the end of the day, it was a good course and learned quite a bit.
"
2016-07-20,Manuel A A T,5,0,"Absolutely a MUST for anyone looking for a smooth intro into APIs, HTTP requests, and data exchange on the web. As always, Dr. Charles' magnificent pedagogy will guide you step by step up to the point where you will be sending requests and fetching data from your Twitter account. Create one if yo do not have it yet. :-)


It will be absolutely beneficial to update this course to discuss the Twitter library available in Python, wish is far easier to use than the currently explained method. 

"
2021-03-18,Hui C H J,5,0,"I have enjoyed learning about how python is utilized for almost everything we do on the internet. I had a lot of fun learning about html, xml and json with Dr. Chuck, who made the concepts easy to learn and understand. The homework assignments allowed you to better understand the lecture material by providing ways for you to practice what was learned. I can't wait to begin the 4th module of this specialization. I highly recommend this course if you've enjoyed the 1st and 2nd modules.  "
2016-02-07,Jeff N,5,0,"
Outstanding Course for a newby. All about programming. Lectures and problems are clear and relate directly to the subject not related topics like statistics and other disciplines which add nothing to the Python and Python programming focus. Dr. Severance has built a great specialization here. Problems can be challenging but doable within the time frame represented by the course description (give or take a couple hours on some of the more challenging ones. I've learned alot! Thanks
"
2020-04-21,Ian F,5,0,"Great course.  A lot of fun!.  I'm a finance guy that knew a little bit about data structure only in MS Access that could modify the sql in there a little bit.  I figured I could use the quarantine to learn something new at night and on the weekends.
I started the first class to get an understanding of python so I could take the statistics classes with python.  Decided to try and finish out the specialization first.  Glad I did.  On to the next...
Thanks Dr. Chuck and support team!"
2016-01-18,Artjom S,5,0,"I like this course, but for me it was a little bit harder to understand some basic stuff. Ie, in JSON for me was confusing to hear ""a list of dictionaries"". 
Furthermore I didn't know what kind of operations I need to apply to them -- therefore I was checking for types of integers and even ""brute forcing"" a combinations of  possible operations. 
As I have finished this course, I'l definitely check again previous chapters to build a better fundamentals in my head.

Thank you dr Chuck!"
2020-07-07,Rodolpho M I,5,0,"Like the first two courses from Python for Everybody specialization, I liked it so much. The material is excellent, Dr. Chuck is clear while he is explaining the concepts and all the codes through the classes. But, in this third course, we saw contents like regular expressions and how to extract and use web data in Python, which are more complex than all the contents of the first two courses. So, because of that, I think this course could have more exercises for us to practice. 

"
2017-09-01,王桢,5,0,"It's more about width rather than depth in this course because learning and using all of the skill in accessing and processing web data through python needs to spend far more time than this. Still this course provides me a good start and a broad understanding of what's going on with areas such as regular expression, XML, Json, API and python's connection with them. I even got some skill and code in my computer to do some tricky operation on the web with python and it is good."
2020-09-22,Brian D H I,5,0,"
This course is great! After reading some of the other reviews I think 
some people missed the point, some said that the course was too 
difficult but I disagree, the level of difficulty was perfect, Dr. Chuck
 thought you enough to be able to complete the assignments as long as 
you really tried and not so much that you would just need to copy and 
paste the answer from the lectures. I loved this course and I'll 
continue to take the next one in the coursera specialization.
      

"
2017-06-10,Calvin K,5,0,"Man, I love Dr Chuck! He explains things in a way that's incredibly easy for anyone to understand. I finished the course in just a couple of days as I'm already quite familiar with Python and most of the stuff and just wanted to use the course as a refresher and checked see if there's any knowledge point that I was missing, but this course is awesome and I recommend it to anyone who's new to getting data from the web! I think I'll take all Dr Chuck's courses in the future!"
2020-11-15,Jay T,5,0,"This was the first course out of the specialization where i had NO prior knowledge and I must say, Dr. Chuck makes the learning process so fun and rewarding. I am happy that we learned XML first and then he saved the best for last with JSON and it did feel easier. I would recommend py4e not only to python beginners, but to ALL computer science beginners. This is the root to your computer science adventure and the options after this are truly limitless. Rock on Dr. Chuck!"
2020-03-28,Sambath M,5,0,"I'm very happy that people like you guys are doing this awesome project which is free teaching.

I loved the course from Dr Chuck, and I learned a lot in this one, about playing and analyzing data in its globality. 
I also learn how data travel through the Internet, and I was captivated by all the process a Data has to do to be read by a user. 
Overall this course is fascinating, and a big thank you to Dr Chuck & All the staff that make this course possible. I love you all."
2016-06-18,Carlos H,5,0,"Great class. Goes over the basics of pulling data from online sources: HTML, XML, JSON. Also goes over the basics of those 3 so if you know nothing about those, the class is helpful. Coming from knowing literally zero about Python and starting from course 1, this is the first course out of the specialization where the assignments were a little tougher and took some googling. (PS I'm using Python 3, so it may be a little more straight forward with 2, I'm not sure though) "
2019-03-03,Ganesh U,5,0,"This was excellent course. It was the 3rd one I took under Python for Everybody. The first 2 were easy, probably since i already knew Python basics. The assignments in this one truly tested my understanding of the topics covered. I had to go back to videos to second time, before I could start on the assignments. Before starting, I was completely new to data formats XML and jSON. Prof Chuck, explained the concepts very well, starting with basics, and building up nicely."
2020-05-18,Mullai P,5,0,I am very much thankful to the university and to the professor Dr Charles Severance  for offering this beautiful course.Such an amazing and adorning course which helps you to understand Python right from the basics to the core  with much clear and deep understanding.The important thing is professor makes the concept very simple so that we easily put that into programming syntax.Thank much for Teaching Assistant also for guiding us in exploring our program much deeper.
2018-11-24,Manuel J T M,5,0,"I'm very gratefull for you allow me to free enroll the course . When I finished the previous course from the Naijin University I need to improve my skills in managing web pages with Python and the course ""Using Python to Access Web Data"" is absolutely suited for this purpose.
Again, thank you, and I may say it  is very nice this ""anglo"" kind of teaching. The assignments are perfect for consolidate the knowledge.
Congratulations four your course and sorry for my english.
"
2017-01-29,Richard C,5,0,"
Third one down in the specialization and still loving the courses. I quite enjoy the fact that the assignments are not given to us step by step but instead make us think through what is required.  The lectures provide the basics needed to complete the assignment but you have to understand and extrapolate on the basics provided. Still very motivated so far. The next course is the main reason I enrolled in this class, getting to play with databases. Thank you Dr. Chuck."
2015-12-05,Bogdan R,5,0,"Extremely good explanations as all courses in the specialization (sometimes much too well explained, as the course targets complete beginners). Additionally, it provides a lot of value by effectively stringing a series on mini courses on specific standard Python libraries, which is something not found everywhere:
* the regular expressions library
* libraries for web communication (socket and urllib) 
* parsing HTML (beautiful soup)
* data transfer libraries (XML and JSON)"
2022-01-04,Hafsah M,5,0,"I really liked the way the whole course was structured, with the lessons, quiz, assignments and then the bonus materials in every week. The quizzes really helped me to evaluate myself and get to know if I actually understood the material or not. The assignments, even though they were a bit challenging sometimes, really helped me strengthen my skills. And, of course, as always, Dr. Chuck taught everything really well in the lectures. All in all, an amazing course!"
2020-05-20,kishor c,5,0,"  I just finished Using"" Python to Access Web Data"", which is the 3rd course in the Python for Everybody specialization.The course wasn't so easy as the previous courses in the specialization as I had to spend more time debugging and practicing.This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data. We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using webAPIs. We will also work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.  "
2020-12-08,Ausra K,5,0,"This is the part of Python for Everybody specialization where you start seeing things, especially things on web, in a totally different light. Suddenly all the buttons and windows become strings of data described in a certain clearly defined and agreed upon way. There is xml and JSON, and you get to understand what they carry in them - things that you're already familiar with, like lists and dictionaries. This is the point where it really gets interesting! "
2021-05-27,Jia Q,5,0,"I would like to give this course a five star. This would be the best python course for beginners. The course modulators are being responsible, they check and answer questions from the class forum everyday. For the contents, there are free pdf books and well-written codes for students to read and practice. The web parts are not solely about coding, I also learned some basic underlying mechanisms. I will definitely continue learning the rest of the courses. "
2017-07-06,KIM S,5,0,"If you are a newbie who has no knowledge in this particular area of programming , you will be surprised to know the fact that the more you try to eagerly learn this subject, the less you have confidence in this. However, as I have gone through this course, I have realized one thing that it is worth try, and you will never regret what you have done or will do in the forthcoming journey that you will one day face. 
Hope you do not ever give up. 
Sincerely,"
2017-12-12,Kevin K,5,0,"This was an excellent introductory course to accessing web data. Almost all of the concepts (aside from basic python syntax) were entirely new to me, and this has primed me for when I encounter these subjects in the future.  

Pros: encompasses many ideas that are important and introduces key concepts
Cons: I'm not positive I can derive most of the codes I wrote on my own, but rather relied on editing sample code to make the assignment submissions work."
2019-12-17,Aditya K,5,0,"I personally found Doctor Chuck's thorough approach to be very beginner-friendly. This is an absolute gem of a course for the budding programmers out there who want an insight into the computer networking functionality, serialization and deserialization of data. It is appropriately paced for learning how to parse webpages and interact with APIs. All in all, I'd recommend this course for everyone beginning with scraping webpages. Thank you Coursera!"
2015-11-08,Christopher H,5,0,"
Extremely useful exercises in pulling data down and getting it ready to process within python.  Very nice (and refreshing realistic) that the programming assignments were of the form ""modify this existing code to do something new with this different data source"" rather than ""build something new from scratch"".  No academic hangups about the paedogogical value of building something from the ground up.  And Dr. Chuck is a wonderfully engaging teacher. "
2020-05-13,Onkar R K,5,0,"This was my 3rd course in the specialization series and was it a blast. I really liked how the things quickly went from 'Oh I can count numbers in a text file without any tracebacks' to 'Oh I can count numbers from a json file which is on web and has dictionaries with lists in them which have dictionaries in them too'
Really liked the pacing, the new assignments style, and of course the man, the legend DR. CHUCK. Overall this course was a blast."
2018-01-29,Amir B,5,0,"Yet another educational, interesting and very much enjoyable course about Python, led by Dr. Chuck. Finding myself occasionally smiling to the laptop while looking at a Python tutorial really says it all.
The content chosen for the course as well as the way the content is taught - it is really something to appreciate. Thank you Dr. Chuck, for sharing your talent to teach with the rest of us.
Using Databases with Python - here i come! 
Thank you.
"
2019-05-13,Vasanth p,5,0,Great course that taught me from the basic operations to APIs where I can scrape data from the web with a small automation python script. The instructor is very talented and his choice of words during the class is like a sculptor who removes unwanted parts of a sculpture. Sharp and crystal clear explanation about concepts that are easily understandable by the beginner. I highly recommend this course to the Python beginners and intermediates.
2020-08-01,Ayush N,5,0,I loved learning with coursera especially in the time time of pandemic(COVID-19) where the whole world was shutdown and people were forced to live at their home for their own safety.In these hard times students were free at their home and bored and have nothing much to do but coursera gave an oppurtunity to all the stuents in the world to learn for free esoecially for college going student.So i am having a great time here with DR.Chuck 
2020-12-06,Lye H F,5,0,"  One of the best free courses available for Python. Practical & well-thought from Dr. Chuck. Extremely talented & passionate in teaching programming. He makes difficult to understand subject interesting and easy to understand. Learn some great insight about processing web data in XML & JSON. Great assignments provided too, which has good practical value in real-life web world. Thank you, Dr. Chuck, for making all these completely free.  "
2020-04-25,NANDA A,5,0,"this course given me a really ass data.......thankyou for the people of univ of michigan....and courseera for providing like this platform to learn and also i would like to request you to provide a bonus video like how to get a API key and all other stuff  from twitter or something else from scratch......i mean pls make a video that how to create developer account and what are the required steps to get an API key
thank you once again "
2015-12-05,Stacy B,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is a brilliant teacher. The Python for Everybody Specialization is perfect for absolute beginners. Between the video lectures and the textbook, I was able to practice each concept until it made sense to me. I have absorbed a phenomenal amount of vocabulary without feeling overwhelmed. Dr. Chuck has boosted my confidence that I can learn this new skill, enjoy every moment of the process and... dare I suggest... get a job!"
2016-01-21,Melissa G,5,0,"This course was awesome. Dr. Chuck is by far, the best professor I've yet to come across, and the only one who taught in a way that I could comprehend. He makes the material easy and fun to understand, without too much hand-holding. I feel confident enough to complete assignments without feeling like I'm just parroting code and not learning anything. These courses are awesome and I can't wait to see what he's going to offer next. "
2017-04-20,Carlos S,5,0,"
I definitely recommend to anyone interested in python programming to
consider take this course with Dr Chuck. It starts from the basic and become a
bit challenging and it is enjoyable whiles you start projecting in ways to use
it. I am looking forward to continue learning and be prepared to apply it in my
work. Thank you Dr Chuck, the way you teach and interest to integrate student
from around the world is very much appreciated. "
2015-12-05,Ojus P,5,0,The professor does a great job of explaining the content in an easily understandable way and is very practical. The assignments require very minimal adjustments to sample code from the lessons so this is far easier than a typical course or say the EdX MIT intro to python course. I came in feeling comfortable in rudimentary python and leave now feeling a lot more prepared to use those skills manipulating the web and calling APIs. 
2015-11-13,Shiva h k B,5,0,"I was sitting behind a proxy server while taking the whole course, I had to get connected to other network without proxy to perform many assignment... It took me some time to realize that urllib can handle proxy server simple by setting an environmental variable. It would be better if Dr. Chuck can give a gist on how to get past proxy in upcoming sessions.
Wrote a crawler and quite often it gets locked up in some kind of error. "
2020-05-27,Andreas G,5,0,"Well explained course offering a very good intro into using python to access web data. It does not replace researching a lot on the internet to fill in a number of gaps, but I believe that is to be expected. It is important to learn to read documentation in order to progress. Therefore, it is better if not everything is bite-size. The concepts have been explained rather well and it certainly increased my desire to learn more.
"
2018-12-09,venkata A k,5,0,This course will be completely helpful to the people who are learning web-development with Python .This will not be specific to Django or Flask framework .The target is to read the data from the API calls through Xml and Json data . ALso it will tell you the basic URL Encoding and decoding to send the data over the server . Regualr expressoins are universal and this course will help you to teach how to implement it in python.
2015-11-24,Dylan K,5,0,"Phenomenal. My second completed course with Dr. Chuck as of now, and I cannot wait for the Databases course. This man is not only passionate, but knowledgeable and energetic as well. His courses are the perfect amount of content, and the presentations are always thorough and applied.

Can't say enough good things about the instructor and the course in general. Python newbie to intermediate user thanks to Dr. Chuck -- I love it."
2017-10-21,Abhishek S,5,0,"There is one thing I believe is missing in some parts. Like Dr. Chuck provide extra material about how networking works. If its possible, may provide material related to REST and APIs and especially about web scraping. Apart from it, everything  is great. Real enjoyed the course. Got to learn lot and lots of things about web and finally know the prestige behind the working of internet. All thanks to Dr. Chuck. Thanks a lot. "
2019-05-19,Clint C,5,0,"well scripted course. i think the instructor makes the journey of learning alot more fun than intimidating. id suggest a smoother introduction of API's and use of JSON, a more introductory explanation to the code used (instead of just letting us use it). might be that the code written for the API calling is too advanced for this class? but just stepping through the code a bit slower can help us. thanks for a great course "
2017-05-19,Alexis b,5,0,"Thanks for this course Dr-Chuck and thanks to Coursera. It was easily comprehensible and constructed for a fast learning. Your clear voice and sentences made it really pleasant for a fluid and fast learning process. Assignments are also well designed so that one can successfully complete it with few effort and understand it fully at the same time. Finished it in 2 days, hope to find others interesting topics from yours !"
2019-12-24,Jacob E,5,0,  I took the whole specialization which I strongly recommend over individual pieces. These courses go through a book provided by Charles Severance. He includes all the material and TONS of code he made. Charles goes through all the code he brings up in the class and explains each piece. There are fluff pieces throughout that are not necessary to pass but offer some history. Overall a great course with a great instructor.  
2018-03-01,Vince D,5,0,"Pretty good, did learn about Json, XML, how it all works together and the coding was challenging but made you think which is good. I liked the course, the instructors were very helpful and responded quickly. Only thing I wish is for the instructions to be a little more clear at the end because they're lengthy.

Other than that I really enjoyed this course and the professor is really knowledgeable!
Videos are quick too!"
2021-02-19,Earl N,5,0,"This is an awesome starter course for Python.  It teaches how to parse xml, html and json.  It teaches loops and recursive programs using functions.  This course is encouraging and keeps you going.  Dr. Chuck is a great speaker and teacher.  The interviews with the founding fathers of todays programming languages and the internet as a joy to watch.  The office hous videos make you feel like your a member of  team.  "
2016-01-23,Paul R,5,0,"Dr. Chuck's lectures are helpful and engaging.  Without them I doubt I would be completing the lessons.  My goal is to learn Python specifically to apply toward improving how we develop medicines for the pharmaceutical industry.  I began taking Dr. Chuck's UM Coursera course after trying out codeacademy and preferred using my own version of Python and IDE rather than the web based compiler provided by codeacademy.
"
2020-03-30,Oscar A,5,0,"The subject is quite massive and complex to get the grasp in a single course.



In any case, Dr. Chuck methodology is quite marvelous, and keeps us engaged to keep learning, and assuring we don't go off track. 



I believe this course provides a good coverage of the subject. From here it's important to read the reference materials, and probably take yet another course to get some other examples.



Loved the content!"
2019-08-22,Shamir T S,5,0,"This course it great! I learned so much about accessing APIs and using XML and JSON in python. I even learned a lot about JSON itself, since it was new to me. Everything is clear and explained. Also everything in this course uses the previous two course as building blocks. Those having a lot of trouble with course may need to review the previous two to be sure that they really grasp what was taught there first."
2018-12-27,Aria B,5,0,"This course is awesome! It shows how to scrape data from the internet in a very easy to learn fashion. There are about 10%~20% of the material that is repetitive between videos/weeks, but generally it is very to the point. One awesome thing about it is that after you get familiar with the underlying material of each week, you learn about a ""shortcut"" that simplifies all the previous steps. Highly recommended."
2016-03-12,Wade W I,5,0,"This is the second Coursera course that I have completed; although, I have enrolled in many.  Dr. Chuck is one of the best MOOC professors that I have every encountered by far.  This course and the quizzes/projects were challenging, but not intimidating.  Typically, I have found a disconnect between the lectures/reference material and the quizzes/projects; however, Dr. Chuck has struck the perfect balance."
2020-04-30,Kunal B A,5,0,"  Its my third course in this specialization. Its very nice course to get started with networking. We get pretty well knowledge of different methods to access web contents. Overall, a very nice course. I enjoyed solving the assignments. We need to do some brainstorming to solve the assignments. really enjoyed it. Thanks to the instructor Mr. Charles Russell Severance for creating such a great course series.   "
2016-02-09,Michael M,5,0,"I liked this course very much! I love Python and now I use it almost every day! There is only one thing that costed me a little more time than others to get used to. I learned Python3 by myself because I was told that Python3 would be more popular. In this course I have had to pay extra attention to the grammar.
Life is short, you need Python. Thank you Chuck! It has been great to learn Python with you!"
2019-07-13,Jarek W,5,0,"Hello
two issue first, in one of assignment i tried to use request lib but it forced me to use urllib only that a little pity, and in last assignment description of it do not mention that user need to use api_key you can only find out that by reading sample code  its this information should be included in description for ppl who want to just write code from 0.
But submitting the whole course was great.  "
2018-02-28,Leon C,5,0,"The intro to network pdf provided by Dr. Chuck was very helpful. It touches on the overview of how the how internet works yet without going through paiful details of physics, mathematics, and engineering. The assignments and quizzes tests your knowledge on some of the important and underlaying details of python programming language that would definitely help me as a programmer and in computer science"
2016-03-12,Suman G,5,0,"It was an experience for me for a lifetime ! I always dreaded about XML and JSON but this course to an extent removed the fear of XML & JSON of mine. I have to practice a lot in coming days to master XML & JSON and at the same time the Python module ""BeautifulSoup"".
The course was just gorgeous and our instructor for this course is just great. This is the 3rd course on Python I completed successfully.

"
2018-03-23,Gaurav B,5,0,"Pros
I think this is a great course and the pace is fantastic. Love the insight provided by Dr. Chuck on the practical applications and also the sample code so we can reference it when stuck. He also has a playful way of teaching that makes it fun.
Cons
The peer review method though was a little bit frustrating but it is crowd-sourcing and saves effort from a single resource checking all submissions. "
2015-11-22,Pavel M,5,0,"I found this course very useful and  learnt how use of regular expressions and later used them to parse HTML pages to look at various tags and content. The use of urllib and BeautifulSoup make my life easier to scrape webpages. Finally, I learnt how to parse XML and  JSON. 
Again, Thank you Dr Chuck  and your team for creating such an interesting and exiting course. I have thoroughly enjoyed this."
2022-05-21,Sara L,5,0,"I could really see my progression from courses 1 & 2 coming to fruition in this course. I learned most through doing the assignments and having to fix my errors. It's such a satisfying feeling to see codes run correctly, and knowing exactly what I need to change/erase in a sample code and what to add/modify to make it run according to the assignment brief. So glad I started this specialisation! "
2018-10-20,Cindy S,5,0,"This course was an interesting look into how the web applications we use everyday store and share data. I am a beginner in this field with no background to computer science and found this course to be fun and comprehensible. I think this course needs more assignments where we practice what we learned, because there is a lot of content that has not been reintroduced since the lecture. Loved it. "
2020-05-06,Gustavo O,5,0,"Hi,
I like to thank you, I've completed the first four courses and I am on my way to the capstone projects. To be frank, from where I started to today I have learnt an enormity of things. I've never thought I would learn so much, particularly since programming is so...all thanks to you Dr Chuck you do have a great way of explaining things. Importantly, I am learning and loving it!
Thanks again."
2019-02-16,Mario A L,5,0,"I loved this course because it highlightes the power of python when it comes to requesting data directly from webpages by means of a few lines of code. This course is more interesting than the previous two from the Specializacion because you have to gather all that you learned to understand the lectures and programming assignments. Exercises are not difficult, but they proved to be insightful"
2020-10-02,Juan J R D,5,0,"I have been reading too many negative comments and it is true in certain parts it becomes so frustrating but waiting for the programming is not easy if you do not pay attention to it. Chuck teaches very well and I had fun in my frustrations LOL because they made me challenge myself to do how to do it and how to implement it I will continue until I finish the 5 courses

print ('Thanks Chuck')"
2018-05-07,Alicia H,5,0,"I have truly enjoyed learning the python language with all of the courses in the Python for everyone specialization!  This course  in particular has been the ""Aha"" moment for me in terms of really grasping the language and feeling comfortable and confident with it.  Thank you Dr. Chuck, and everyone involved with the creation of these courses.  3 down, 2 to go!  See you at the next course!"
2017-01-23,GANJI M S,5,0,"  I feel this course is very useful for someone who is new to python and Dr. Chuck's way of teaching is very good. I felt that only young graduates or IT professionals will take the course, but i was surprised after seeing in the bonus videos that many experienced professionals are also taking this course. I strongly recommend this course to someone new to programming. Thank you, Dr. Chuck.  "
2019-03-08,Carlos J B A,5,0,"
I have decided to complete this course because I feel that what I have been able to contribute throughout these weeks has simply been incredible. I have been able to acquire new skills that I am sure will help me achieve my goals. The challenges I have had in this course have helped me to become a better version. I appreciate immensely the work they do day by day in education. Thank you.

2020-09-01,Dev T A N,5,0,"  Using Python to Access Web Data"" was definitely more challenging than its predecessors in the specialization but it gave me a good taste for how even a simple program in Python can reach out to the world, access meaningful data, and do something useful with it.
It's an amazing course 
Thank you Dr. chuck, University of MIchigan and Coursera to offer this course to people across the world.  "
2020-08-13,Rishikesh P,5,0,"Dr. Charles Severence is a great instructor and a wonderful person. He is the only teacher I have seen who aims at changing life and knows the psychology of students to be able to motivate them. The bonus section is wonderful , even though I have not seen all of them , I can tell that they are huge motivation as we get to know the wonderful world of computers. Love you sir. Many thanks."
2020-07-29,Amrutha C,5,0,This is my third course on Coursera Platform. I really enjoyed the course. The course instructor is awesome explaining content very well. The course material and content is also good. I recommend those who'd like to take this course to practice a lot. This course requires a lot of practice. And don't leave anything that is provided in this course. Everything that is provided is useful.
2020-05-17,Marcus S,5,0,"i enjoy the interviews from the old days and learn a bit of the history. The assignments have been designed very well, i.e. I almost lost my mind in week 4, but because of that I learned a lot. for me code is like a computer game and back in the 90ties I stopped because I got totally absorbed by games :) LOVE IT. Will continue with other courses beyond python after I finish this series  
"
2018-03-07,Elinor W,5,0,"This is an excellent introduction to the way Python programs interact with the greater Internet and information exchange across platforms. It got me genuinely excited about the development and structure of web systems in a way that I haven't been before, and it's great to actually be able to apply that understanding through the programs that I write with the aid of the course material."
2017-09-28,Mohan B,5,0,"The course content is well structured and even non programmers can take it without any issues. The instructor, Charles Severance is great in explaining every topic in detail. The assessments helps to check the knowledge gained. If you are struck any where in the assessment, an instructor is click away to help you. Not to mention, the forums are great way to interact on various topics.  "
2021-08-01,Haofan S,5,0,"This course is really good. The lectures and sample videos are easily understood. The sample codes are helpful and simple. Although you might feel challenge for homeworks, the TA are really helpful. You can use discussion forums to ask questions and usually get replies at the next day. I would be very happy to introduce this course to anybody who is interested in coding with Python."
2015-12-05,mahmood d,5,0,"
One of the best features in online courses compared to self-learning is pseudo interactive environment through video-lectures. So whenever the professor is capable of providing short, compelling and attractive speech, it's really great.  Any reduction of reading means reducing the work of learner. this point is more obvious in programming courses.
This course in this term does great."
2020-07-24,Pratik S K,5,0,"Excellent course ! I learnt more about
how to access web using python. 
I learnt interesting things like web scraping, json , XML.
The material were very easy to follow and deliver in a very friendly and engaging manner.
I would like to thank instructor Dr. Chuck  for making this course amazing and enjoyable.
I highly recommend this course to anyone just getting started in programming."
2018-03-14,swati,5,0,"This is a brilliantly designed course for beginner and intermediate level. The assignment difficulty level ranges from easy to medium and reinstates important concepts in every chapter.
Do not subscribe if - 1) You are at advance level for any other programming language. 
2) You are a beginner in programming languages and haven't completed previous two courses in the specialization.

2017-09-05,Deleted A,5,0,"I am lucky enough to find this online course of programming and meet Python （maybe the easiest programming language in the world）. Before I attend this course, I was very reluctant to learn Programming languages and even hated them a little.  This class and this magical language changed my mind totally. Therefore, I feel grateful to our respectable professor. Thank you very much "
2016-11-30,Karol N,5,0,Every course taught by dr Chuck is a new quality. Substance of the course is little more demanding than previous 2 courses but paradoxically I had a feeling that new topics were taught without going into details... which paradoxically is good for the course. Dr Chuck showed some teasers of Python abilities and if You are more interested in some topics You practice in on your own
2018-09-21,Tonderayi K,5,0,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Chuck's tutorials, for the first time Regular Expressions were explained in a way that made them less intimidating and motivated me to learn more on my own. The inserts of videos about the Internet was also cool. I also learnt several different ways about webscrapping. Before I only knew about Beautifulsoup, now I know more and when to use which tool :)"
2016-10-16,Leo B,5,0,"I have enjoyed this course very much - same as the two prior courses. The main differences are: this course was much more difficult and Dr. Chuck used some new video recording technology. I thought the presentations were more direct and to the point, but enjoyed the previous style from earlier courses as well. I would recommend this course and the associated courses to anyone."
2020-07-07,Esmerelda M B D M,5,0,"The 3rd installment of 5 courses in the Python for everybody specialization; and again a great course. I enjoyed the two preceding courses as a novice in programming and this 3rd course was more challenging for me.  I had to do my own research to understand the 'whys' but overall, it's all good.  Dr.Chuck as usual made the course worthwhile. Looking forward to the 4th course! "
2018-04-25,Shou-Chung W,5,0,"I enjoyed the learning experience from the lecture, the challenges from the assignment and rekindled with my interest and desire to learn more.  I am happy to have had this wonderful experience.  Oh, I also find Dr. Chuck's office hour videos provide a very positive psychological effect for the audience, especially when you realized who else are taking the same course as you.  "
2020-07-12,Kanza N,5,0,"This was the most challenging course until now in the specialization. Because I was a bit confused about what is API and how we are talking to it and because It was more of understanding than coding but hats off to DR.Chuck, he will keep you cheered up and will take you to the end. Things will make sense sooner or later, so keep it up. Don't give up. Best Of Luck to y'all !"
2020-05-30,Heitor U B,5,0,"I really learned a good set of skill with this course, the previous ones on the Python for Everybody set the base for this course which every once in a while got me thinking more than my skeptical self would think i was going to and i actually had fun doing all the assignments as challenges. I definitely recommend this one, if you want to start you quest on python for web."
2018-07-08,Pedro H,5,0,"After completing the specialization, I can say that this is a thorough course for Python programming that starts from the very basics to a pretty in depth understanding of the programming language. It provides with a complete set of skills that can be applied to your very needs. Highly recommended for beginners and people that want to consolidate their knowledge in Python."
2017-04-01,Nick M,5,0,"This course was informative, useful, and fun - one of the best programming courses I've taken on Coursera. I'm on the road to being able to use python for data cleaning and analysis in my work and this course felt like a major stepping stone. I'd like to sincerely thank Dr. Chuck for putting this course together - he's giving so many people an opportunity to learn to code."
2020-04-20,Rene A M,5,0,"Everything is really well explained and the content is introductory. I wished there were more worked out examples and the sample code were documented with the explanations of the course. But if you know nothing about the subject but know a little python, make no mistake and take this course.  My sincere thanks to everyone involved in making this lovely course! Best Rene"
2018-03-22,Pedro M E,5,0,"This course gives a great insight about the power that the Python programming language has in order to deliver practical solutions to access network data from across the Internet. No matter what the varied native protocols the resources reside, Python included libraries can provide a means to parse the data seamlessly and save timeless hours to deliver a useful code."
2020-11-14,Emma A,5,0,"I love the contents of this course.
My issue is with the assignments. To some extent, it gives much more clue than what will make the leaner think deeply.
Also, there are some codes in the assignment sample that were very vital to solving the assignment but was not explained into details. So all I did was just copying those parts and changing what's needed to change."
2020-12-11,Neeraj S,5,0,"  Thanks, Dr. Chuck and his team. Actually, this course was really difficult. But Dr. Chuck helped us to teach in a very amazing and fantastic manner. He told the concepts of Regular Expression, Sockets, Networks, APIs, etc. amazingly. He explained a lot of crucial examples in an easy way. I hope that you will soon visit my county and I will be ready to welcome you.  "
2016-09-11,Joffrey W,5,0,"Where the first courses were really about laying down the python foundations this one showed me the first practical applications. I really thought that this API business was never going to be easy to understand but thanks to this course I am now directly getting data from our online ERP system and creating my first simple analytical programs.
Really exciting stuff!
"
2021-03-01,Brandon E G V,5,0,"I loved this course, you finish it with very good bases of python and web services. It is true that sometimes it's quite difficult to understand but it's only about viewing the videos again or seeking for help on internet (Not copying code, that is cheating). Remember that the teacher only give us the pathway, but also we need to put effort to learn by ourselves."
2020-04-18,Turab H K,5,0,Dr. Chuck you are a beauty. I love how you teach such complex things with such ease and in such a simple way that even a person without much understanding can understand. This course is purely made for those people who have basic knowledge of python programming and want to explore the data extraction from web pages using python in a very easy and simple manner.
2021-11-11,malamula m,5,0,"I found the going very easy, the videos are well made short. took alot of effort to make such videos. I have hard a chance to learn by watching other where you easily get bored long ending up loosing concentration but not these one. The lecture Dr Charles know very well how to teach I give him a thumb up. Thanks AAL for giving me the chance to be on this cours"
2020-04-01,Federico C,5,0,The course from Dr Chuck has really made it so easy and entertaining for people to get interested into Python. I have spent most of my career working in project management but never been able to approach the technical aspect too much because learning code seemed scary and tedious. This course has made me change my opinion on that completely. Thanks Dr. Chuck!!
2020-03-31,Philip K,5,0,"This is a well designed course.  For someone who has very little programming experience, I found the course to be a good challenge.  The best feature of this course is the forum.  Every time I got stuck on an assignment, I read through some of the submissions on the forum and was able to figure out my mistake, make the correction, and complete my assignment."
2019-12-15,Harsh M,5,0,Learned a lot in this course. Initially when i tried on my own to study Web Access i found too complicated but after studying from coursera it looks like i have always study in a wrong way but got the accurate direction through this course work.Would definitely like to explore more domains of knowledge through this and would love to continue coding in python
2021-03-07,shangjie m,5,0,"Very good course to expand your knowledge about using python to access the web data. So I see lots of students complained that the course is way too difficult than the preceding two ones.  However, you should know any course can only help you a little bit of something. You should explore more and spend more time in making yourself a expert of some subject."
2020-08-28,ANA L C G,5,0,"This is a challenging course because you have the opportunity to really check that all the knowledge that you had just acquierd you learned it. So there are differents activities in which you can review them. I love this specialization course. Thank you to all the professors who made it possible, specially to Dr. Chuck who made the class amazing and funny. "
2019-11-13,Boris A V,5,0,"I help myself with online translator programs to understand the videos. I think that we who do not speak English well, we are at a disadvantage.

I suggest that someone fluent in Spanish and English translate the subtitles in Spanish. I would do it, but I fear to misinterpret what the instructor says. For everything else, the course is excellent.

Thank you!"
2019-08-18,HITEN S,5,0,"Great course, the easiest way to get advance concepts into my mind is to learn from professor dr chuck, dr chuck provides the necessary and hard to get concepts in easy manner. Also the level of abstraction increases in this course, because there are new and advance topics as compared to first two course, so topics which are relevant to course are covered."
2019-05-03,Gregory S,5,0,"I thought this was an excellent course.  I think the first exercise in week six could use some better explanation.  Other than that, I loved the course.  This was my third course in the Python for Everybody Specialization and I am now working on course number four.  These courses build upon each other very well.  Stick with them and you will learn allot."
2019-02-17,Anastassios K,5,0,"It's wasn't easy for me. I struggled to find all the answers. But this is how it was supposed to be in order to really understand the concept of the course.
The material provided is adequate , the teaching excellent and I'm proud to finish the course without knowing any of the concepts before (I'm just novice in Python).
Thank you Dr Chuck and Coursera."
2016-05-23,Chen C,5,0,"Everything is perfect about this course. Topics are practical, examples are easy to follow and Dr. Chuck is a funny companion.
Two suggestions to improve the course: to design bonus assignments that require more sophisticated and related Python applications; to give direction of going deeper in certain topics, such as leveraging Amazon API.
Thank you! 
"
2015-12-28,Stefan K,5,0,"This course builds on knowledge gained from previous two courses in Specialization, so it can be taken without taking previous two given the participant has enough programming knowledge. The assignments are practical and content very well explained by great instructor. This course provides an example of using python in real-world small applications."
2020-03-22,Shubham C,5,0,"If you are a beginner to web development, this course might seems little tough to you. Dr. Chuck is again really good teacher and explanation is also pretty good, but the thing is you are expected to learn some specific things not all things and from that point you get little diverted. But it's really a good course and finally you gonna love it!!!!"
2019-09-15,Chad W,5,0,This course breaks down working with outside data sources into easy to digest segments.  The instructor keeps your attention and very effectively relates the content without getting down into the weeds.  The assignments in this course begin involving practical uses for getting data from external sources and working with it effectively.  I loved it.
2021-04-04,Nicolás U,5,0,"Excelente curso, aprendí bastante sobre como acceder a los datos en internet mediante python y tengo un panorama mas claro de como funciona la transferencia de datos mediante internet.
Recomiendo ampliamente este curso para cualquiera que quiera tener una introducción de como funciona el internet y la manera de acceder a los datos mediante python."
2020-12-10,Naum F,5,0,"Hello Dr. Chuck and the team,
I believe that courses don't have enough exercises to practice.
You should include at least the references for the corresponding
exercises (I have used for that w3resource.com/python-exercises/, but 
there is not all topics presented good enough). Without extensive practice 
these nice courses don't have their real power."
2018-12-30,Aditya M,5,0,"The course went great. I had queries a few times when I was going through the course. Thankfully, the new feature of 'Notes' has helped me a lot. I would like to say a thing for people who are going to take the course - ""Don't lose hope and don't stop trying. Even if an assignment might be a bit hard for you, keep revising and trying. Thank you."""
2018-09-27,Jernej Z,5,0,"Great expansion of the beginner's and advanced course in Python that enables users to read data from the web. I appreciate the hands-on approach even though it took me quite some time to complete the assignments. That said, the satisfaction of realizing that only a few lines of Python can get you the information you want/need is beyond priceless."
2020-05-08,Moses I T,5,0,"The beauty of this course is in the very simple and clear explanation that Dr Chuck gives, and the amount of resources available to support a learner. Everyone who commits to this course can finish it, and this is true of the whole specialization! Thanks Dr. Chuck and Team. I will complete this specialization thanks to all these great qualities!"
2021-03-26,Samuel K N,5,0,"It is a great continuation to the precious courses, particularly as we get to apply it to real scenarios.
Dr Chuck is a great communicator, so it is easy to follow through building up Python knowledge and its applications. Great to learn APIs and new libraries; it comes handy to learn about the use of new objects and methods.
Highly recommend it!"
2019-01-15,Jawwad A,5,0,"Hello Dr.charles , my name is javad ali and i am studying computer engineering  and  i am feeling proud being your student . Sir , i am very thankful to You and the coursera  that provides me excellent education as well as making our career. my words are limited to describe your  honest and best  teaching methodology. once again thank you all !"
2021-11-12,Kaiquan M,5,0,"This course was a good introduction to:
Strings, regex
HTTP, sockets
Retrieving and reading HTML data from web pages, Urllib, BeautifulSoup 
Retrieving and reading XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data 
Retrieving and reading JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data 

More technical and challenging than the first 2 courses in the specialisation."
2020-01-19,Spencer K,5,0,"This one was certainly a little more challenging than the first 2 courses but also more rewarding.  For many of us this is where the meat really is...getting access to data.  The tools you learn are a great starting point i suppose and with practice you should be able to apply this knowledge IRL and get value from it.

Thanks again Dr. Chuck!!!"
2015-12-07,Carolina C,5,0,"I really like this course. I was able to learn several useful concepts to retrieve data from the web. I like the assignments, there are needed to practice and see the potential use of the material class. Lectures are very easy to follow with several examples that help you to remember previous concepts. Maybe I would like to see more examples! 
"
2020-07-05,Ramola S,5,0,well I was a very nice experience that I ever had during my learning process I would like to thanks Coursera and the University of Michigan also Dr. Chuck who taught me such a cool concept also I do remember the bonus videos of his work and I am glad that I can gain something from this platform thank you University of Michigan and Dr Chuck 
2015-12-04,Marco S,5,0,"I liked this course a lot, even I wasn't really a beginner for Python. I learned some really cool stuff!
Maybe one minor improvement could be to also use the learned things from Week 1 (regular expressions) even in the other assignments. I found regular expressions a really interessting topic but missed them a bit in the rest of the course."
2020-07-22,ARKABH B,5,0,"I learnt a lot of new things in this course. I sure take a lot times tom complete this course. Things are getting hard but the way Prof. Charles Severance taught the course, make the whole thing easy. I want to thank professor for this beautiful approach. I also want to thank University of Michigan for providing such a wonderful content."
2018-04-04,Ruperto A J,5,0,"Given basic Python know-how, this course reveals the basic engine of web crawlers - similar to Google's way of finding new sites. It also demonstrates techniques in JSON and XML implemented as static-structure hierarchial databases with the added dynamic-restructuring ability i.e. adding/removing data fields (controlled by Python code) !   "
2020-11-21,Saul A L H,5,0,Este curso ya es un poco mas avanzado y es necesario haber llevado los cursos antetirores para principiantes y tener bien claros los ejejmplos de las diferentes estructuras de datos. En general es un curso completo para obtener informacion de internet con Python y abarca conceptos basicos y fundamentales para despues seguir aprendiendo.
2020-05-24,Hoang L P,5,0,"Extremely fun course mixed with a healthy amount of challenge, I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone with a beginner's level of understand of Python. Aside from the absolute train wreck of wrong sample answer in the final assignment on geojson API, this course is beautifully constructed and the contents are rich and intriguing. 10/10!"
2016-11-17,Shaun C,5,0,"
Good, too much of seeing the professors face while in the middle of explaining code. Not that he's ugly, but when looking at code, it helps to keep it on the screen a bit longer, rather than showing his face momentarily and then back to the code. Throws me off a bit, and I find myself needing to pause the videos to understand the code."
2015-11-26,Jo S,5,0,"This course is one of the best I've taken on Coursera. The lecturer is engaging and makes the subject matter interesting and clear. The exercises are considered and related to the lectures, so can be completed without pain or massive amounts of prior knowledge. It's a course for anyone wanting to brush up their Python - I recommend it!"
2020-05-27,Lalita K,5,0,"  Dr. Chuck is one of the best teachers. But the course must have more content and more explaination. The libraries should have been explained more. For beginners this course is a good one.. But i would say whatever the content was there.. Dr. Chuck explained it very neatly.. Hats Off to Dr, Chuck for giving his best for the students.  "
2015-12-04,Andriy Z,5,0,"
Thanks Dr Chuck for a perfect, easy and interesting course. All topics that were discussed contain source code that is self described and easy to understand. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn something new. Many thanks to Dr Chuck and all people who make this course open to everybody. And thanks Coursera also :)"
2018-05-07,Sunny M,5,0,"As expected this course was more challenging than the first two courses of the specialization of 'Python for Everybody'. I didn't expect to make so much progress in such a short time but it was definitely worth it so far and I expect it to get even more exciting. Thanks a lot the Dr. Chuck, I'm very happy that I found your courses."
2019-09-17,Scott G,5,0,Dr Chuck does a great job explaining the logic behind the code.  While there are a few things that triped me up and made me read the documentation for the libraries (particularly when the examples in the videos were using a string of xml data while the assignment called for garbing it from the web) the research helped my learning.
2018-06-23,Damien C,5,0,"I've been able to apply what I learned in this course to a project I am working on for work and I'm very glad I took it. The subject matter is presented in a way that keeps you engaged and the assignments at the end are fairly challenging. Overall, I can honestly say this course has helped me to upgraded my Python coding skills."
2022-06-11,Mah E U,5,0,This course is very beneficial for me. As a student as I am learning Python in an IoT course designed by NAVTCC at Sir Syed University Gulshan Karachi. This course has incredibly improved my programming skills day by day. I am extremely grateful to the Coursera Instructor and team. Thank you so much from the depths of my heart. 
2017-01-09,Hadar S,5,0,"The course is excellent for anyone who wants to build on their Python Knowledge, build a little Web Application interacting with an API or generally pull data from the Web using Python for any purpose.
Dr. Chuck is great as usual and does an excellent job of teaching & conveying the course material - Thank you for this course :)"
2016-11-06,magda a,5,0,"Excellent introduction. Made easy to follow with fantastic supporting materials (thanks, Dr Chuck!) but dense - I might have to revisit this material but for now will forge ahead! Great gratitude for an excellent series of Python courses - just the right length so they can be completed in good time, while building confidence."
2020-05-28,Siddhartha D,5,0,"II gave it 5 stars, but many will not agree as some of the lectures were not enough to complete the assignment.  agree with it. that's was good for me because I was searching the internet and finding ways to get that done. which will help me to remember this stuff for a longer period of time. I finished this course in 3 days"
2020-06-05,Priyesh K,5,0,"It is a very good course to get started with using python for web scraping. Dr. Chuck is a great teacher and always talks about the fundamentals first, which i really liked. The assignments of the course are really good to deeply understand the concepts but should be a little bit more tougher. Overall i enjoyed the course. "
2020-06-01,Radha M,5,0,"This was my most liked but also the most difficult of the modules. Reason for that was, I had to personally do a lot of brain storming and understand the syntax and usage of certain of the functions. However each assignment gave a better knowledge of these. The discussion forums were very, very helpful, especially Tamara."
2016-11-06,Mayank R,5,0,"This is the third course that I have completed under the Python for Everybody specialization. Just like the first two courses, this course kept me interested throughout and taught me some very important concepts and libraries of Python. Strongly recommended for anyone interested to enhance their basic knowledge of Python. "
2016-10-10,Mustafa K,5,0,I have completed the third Python course. I used the knowledge for my android project to get data from a website and clean it. Thanks a lot Dr. Chuck for your amazing job and enjoy-fulness :) And thanks Coursera and Michigan University for serving free online education opportunities for students from all around the world.
2017-12-14,Senthil K,5,0,"  Dr Chuck was fantastic. He spends more time in explaining concepts in details. This course in conjunction with previous Python courses. Not just Python, I have learnt about XML, JSON, working with APIs. Totally enjoyed the course. I was able to watch the sessions multiple times. Thanks Dr Chuck and Coursera for the MOOC.  "
2017-03-10,Johnny F,5,0,Great series of courses at just the right pace. I can do one in my lunch hour and not have to think about 4-5 hours of study per week. Also you can self pace and go much faster so you can finish the course in 1-2 weeks but I always find it is better to take a little longer to let the ideas sit and bounce around a little.
2018-04-21,汪悦,5,0,"I spent some time adapting to the easy way of teaching, as I was using Windows system and there are several differences between my infrastructure and that of the instructor's, e.g. Oauth for Twitter API never worked on my computer. But I also learned to install pip and different packages myself. Great way of exploring!"
2016-01-16,Anastasia N,5,0,"Loved this class. Perfect level of difficulty for me, engaging videos, and the material provides the right amount of info to get the assignments done without being too obvious. Dr. Chuck is really entertaining :) I am seeing more and more ways that I can apply this to my work and look forward to the continuing classes."
2020-09-20,Jeremiah R,5,0,"If you would like an understanding of the fundamentals taking place behind libraries such as requests, coupled with an overview of the protocols and data formats that power service layers then this is the course for you. 

If you want to find a tutorial regarding API use with requests, this course will not provide that. "
2020-09-19,Praveen N,5,0,"A great course by Dr. Chuck. Very informative and covers how to access web data using python. You will learn how to scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. You will be working with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. This is not a class for experts but more suited for beginners."
2020-11-30,DUGLAS V,5,0,"I am so happy to have finished this third module. Every time I find myself with more confidence to develop the problems that arise. It is a good moment to congratulate Professor Chuck, who presents an extraordinary methodology and knowledge transmission, for which I thank him. See you in the next python for everyone."
2020-11-29,Paulina B R,5,0,I took a little bit of a break while completing this course but it was nice that I was able to pick up where I left off and did not have to worry about resetting my deadlines. Professor Chuck is incredible at explaining the different topics that he is teaching and it's awesome how many resources are available to us ! 
2016-11-13,Jiejia Y,5,0,"This course is entering a different web world, which is a little complicated for me to understand it. In general, Professor Severence did a good job to show the basic ideal for us in an relatively easier way. I would really appreciate if this course can recommend more reading materials to help students to understand."
2020-04-30,Abey M,5,0,This course was undertaken as part of the Python Specialization. I found it to be engaging and hands on. Dr. Chuck has a very interesting style in explaining the theory breaking it into parts which is easy to comprehend. I would recommend this course for those new to Python to know more about how to access web data. 
2019-11-21,李昀泽,5,0,"thanks doc chunk.And other teachers are also helpful,i think.Someone  has said that thhi course is so difficult since it requires us to learn by ourselvers ,but i  think it is a good thing because teachers can't teach all of the things in a short video.I also enjoy the process of finding problems and figure it out.."
2019-01-24,Vinayak N,5,0,"This course added an important tool to my arsenal. It taught me how to retrieve different elements from websites using libraries like beautiful soup and the basic python urllib library and now, I can scrape the web to hunt for stuff that I want in a customized way. Thank you Dr. Chuck for this comprehensive session!"
2017-03-12,Orel F,5,0,"Great course. Learned a lot about JSON and XML. Expanded my view of what is possible in programming. Never explained SOAP or why it sucks, and I can kinda explain REST, but still not quite sure what ""representational state"" refers to. Its just data, no state, and no representation, so why is it called that. Thanks!"
2020-07-17,Tang W K,5,0,"Videos were interesting and well paced, with enough direction given to a coding beginner. Explanations were easy to follow and assignments, while guided, still require enough thought to be completed. Felt that I came out of it with a better foundation of python, especially how applications call out to one another."
2020-05-12,James F A,5,0,"This is my first time studying web data, so it quite difficult for me, but I find it challenging especially one of the assignments in URL links takes me almost two hours to figure it out. Dr. chuck is a very good professor, he has delivered all the lessons effectively so we can understand it much better. Thank you"
2020-02-09,Daniel D,5,0,"It's great course, the concepts are complex but presented and explained very clearly and easy to understand. Unlike some other courses from the Michigan Uni, I highly recommend this one, especially for people starting working with Python. Instructor is clearly passionate about what he's doing. Well done Dr Chuck!"
2020-11-01,Chris A,5,0,"Certainly more challenging than the prior two courses but the forums helped get over a hurdle as others had similar questions and while the specific answer is not provided in the forums, the assistants' suggestions to others helped me think about things differently and finally get to what I needed to accomplish."
2017-08-14,Arnav M,5,0,"This course is again like the usual , amazing and i learned a lot and the quizzes challenges a lot and the coding section needs to step up a bit as i think that they are not so challenging as we get most of the code from the videos . 
But an amazing job once again fro Dr.Chuck . Sir i have became a fan of yours."
2016-12-28,Scott D,5,0,"Like the other courses in the series, Dr. Chuck has a way of making course content tangible, easy to consume, and non-intimidating. Framing the lessons around real-world scenarios helps a lot. This instructor and the content are a breath of fresh air and truly reflect the ""for everyone"" theme in the book title."
2022-02-09,Syed M A K,5,0,"It solidifies the concepts of lists, dictionaries and many more data structures being used by python libraries is communicate over web. This course is good for beginner who want to get started with the notion of how basically data on web is transferred and it does not go into great detail to explain everything"
2020-05-15,Sagar Z,5,0,"Great Course. I did not anything about web applications before joining this course. If you are new too, don't worry prof explains it like it's a piece of cake.  Just know basic python.
Having passed first two courses, I had  enough knowledge of Python. This and Prof. helped learn this great stuff in short time."
2017-04-18,Rujin Z,5,0,"Thanks MR. Chuck! you're always so humorous and thought-provoking!
A small suggestion: when switching on the transcript button, the scripts would bar some PPT contents (bottom parts), which then asks you to switch it off.
Prof. Chuck the course series is indeed really helpful and leading for students! Thank you."
2015-11-29,Ryan W,5,0,The course provides a fabulous overview of using Python to access web data sources either via a scrape and search of HTML or via XML/JSON data provided by an API. The course builds on the previous two courses in the sequence; if you have completed those then I suspect you can continue your journey with Python.
2016-08-08,Amr E,5,0,"Great class. The video lectures cover the topics in a very interesting and easy to understand way and the exercises make sure that I understood what I learned, also, I like the idea of providing part of the source code which helps maintain the focus on the things that are newly learned while writing the code."
2018-12-30,Benn L,5,0,Very useful materials for me to make use of the data from the web after taking this course. I am a beginner with a couple of university entry level programming courses prior taking this online course. Very pleased with the simple yet detail instructions in both code packages and videos throughout the course.
2020-07-01,Dream P,5,0,"This course ended up being a phenomenal learning experience! As you delve into python and web formats, at first it can be very frustrating as everything is alien to you. With patience, practice and trying things out it starts to become known as your other Python skills are. Dr. Chuck is a fantastic teacher."
2015-12-05,Dmitrijs J,5,0,"Very well designed and organized courses. Best mentor Dr. Charles Severance it perfectly explains the study material for those who are in the first encounters with the technology of programming computers.
Personally, I'd add that this course helped me understand the programming language Python.
Regards Dmitry"
2020-04-29,Andy Y,5,0,"Similar to previous courses, Dr. Chuck gave a clear introduction and easy beginning to real application of Python, in accessing web data. While it could be far more complication in real life, it provided us basic idea and concept which could really facilitate us in future exploration. Well designed course!"
2018-09-07,Alexandre W,5,0,"Great for beginers as well as medium level scripters, that are looking to root their experience with Python into knowledgeable roots. This course describe the basics of Python very well, and goes straight into interesting topics for practical application such as Network, scrapping, regular expression, etc."
2018-01-21,Albert D I,5,0,"I had no idea about Python but thanks to this course I am learning the basic of it, files, internet connetion, databases, etc.  I just can´t stop!! But I don´t think is so basic as it says, for a complete rokie in programming there are a lot of concepts which will be difficult for the person to understand."
2017-11-02,mustafa a,5,0,"thanks very much Dr-chuck and your staff they are very helpful ,
I find this course very useful as an introduction to Accessing web data and how it is work so I recommend this for any one who is fresh with some thing like this like me

Thank you for a wonderful courses ,Keep up the great work and surly one day its gonna change the education system.In India Many Educational Institutes are there just for business . So the one who need the real knowledge Surely gonna get through this.  Thanks for such a wonderful and knowledgeable Course . "
2019-05-16,Ranjana P,5,0,This was a tough course and tbh I think I am going to come back to it to go through it. There is so much good information. It is also taught very well. It will take me some time to properly digest this knowledge. Thank you Dr Chuck and everyone who has been in the team to produce this course. Keep it up.
2015-11-07,Layne C,5,0,Another great course from Dr. Chuck. The instructor effectively distills the relevant information needed for someone to learn the material without belaboring the underlying theory. These courses are great for people to get their hands dirty as well as more experienced programmers wanting to learn Python. 
2020-09-17,Ben V D,5,0,"I really enjoyed this course. Although I would like to have a bit more assignments and exercises, the course content is great. Chuck really dives into interesting concepts & software programs with enthusiasm. Great teacher and great course for getting to know the basics of accessing the web with Python!"
2016-07-23,Richard G,5,0,A very very good course.  Dr Severance did an excellent job and provides a very thorough explanation of the topics.  I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning Python in a hands on and interactive way.  The quizzes and the exercises were good and directly track the course material.
2020-09-25,Ramiz S,5,0,"  A very useful course. The instructor dives into webservices just enough so that the learner has learned the basics and main concepts, rather than diving into may details that discourage the learner. after the course you are free to dive more into web services and you have a base that you can build on.  "
2016-10-31,Krishnan. N,5,0,"Python is a really good programming language and it was presented in the best possible way! The lectures, quiz, assignments and the book - especially the book - all went together really, really well.
In summary, one of the best put-together MOOC courses i've had the pleasure of attending. Thanks a ton! 
"
2016-02-21,Andriy S,5,0,"This was a really great course, I enjoyed it a lot. A always wanted to write parsers on my own, and know, thanks to Dr. Chuck, I have the required knowledge base. I think that completing this course will really help me through my life. Thank you, Coursera and Dr.Chuck, for this fantastic opportunity! "
2015-12-13,Amit V,5,0,I worked with Python in 2001 for my first job at a hedgefund company. It was refreshing to work on the basics of the language and to refresh syntax and new libraries. Python is a powerful language and Dr. Chuck has made it easy for beginners as well as for advanced members to quickly get up to speed.
2022-09-03,Kiki H,5,0,"comparing to the previous section, I feel that the difficulty of this class has increased a lot, which means I need to spend more time to understand it. In particular, since we are not native English speakers, many concepts were a little difficult to understand.....Anyway, still enjoyed the class ：）"
2020-04-24,Pulimaddi B,5,0,"Before joining this course, I don't know anything about web services. But I came to know this all because of the course instructor (professor severance) . Thank you for the wonderful course. Assignments are also quite similar to worked examples. we can gain much knowledge by doing these assignments."
2020-10-27,Christofer O,5,0,"I think this is a very interesting courses about web services, even though I don't really into to programming about web services, but I must admit this amazing courses even for beginner like me and also this courses opens my view about web services in python with simple manner. Thank you dr. Chuck."
2020-08-20,Raghav S,5,0,"This has been the best course I've opted till date.
This course's topics were new to me and I found it a bit difficult, but thanks to Dr.Charles Severance who made it very easy for me to keep up going with the course and his way of teaching made it quite easy to understand the topics taught so far ."
2020-04-02,Sachin K J,5,0,This course is really very simple for those who already know some programming languages. And too abstract for those who are really new to programming. I would suggest you to go through book once in a while after you complete the chapter that will really help you some up everything you have learned.
2021-01-30,Ruth C,5,0,"love the class. It is a little unfamiliar territory since i do not have a computer science back ground and find the high level intro to accessing the web very useful. Having had self-taught to write bash scripts and working in R, it does help to understand everything that was taught in the course."
2020-09-16,Diana M,5,0,"Overall I really enjoyed the class. Using the free Python book as a supplement helped me to solidify newly acquired information. Dr Chuck's explanations are, as usual, impeccable. I encourage everybody who's taken the first two classes in the Python specialization to also take this one. Good luck!"
2017-01-17,Robert T,5,0,"Professor Charles Severance is great. Very straightforward, positive attitude. Fun to learn Python. He covered some good material on the background of XML and JSON with interviews and reviewed concepts necessary to call both XML defined by Schemas XSD and JSON service with rate-limiting and OAuth."
2016-07-18,Richard I C,5,0,"This is the third course in the Python for Everyone series, which builds on the lessons of the first two courses. The course's automated grading made it easy to continue with each assignment at my own pace; and the way the information is presented makes it easy to learn without getting frustrated."
2020-05-26,Ahmed E,5,0,"Dr. Chuck makes things easy to understand, he dives deep into the subjects and make them sound so familiar even if it's the first time you know about it. This course is on everyone's level and will take you form no programming background to a comfortable level to take on more advanced curriculum. "
2020-09-12,Tiwari S R,5,0,"I Really Enjoyed The Course. The Good Part of this Course is Bonus Chapter And Interviewing Part so we come to know How That particular Thing Invented.The Course Really Improve My knowledge as after this course Now I'm able to extract data from Web and also able to work with HTML,  XML and JSON.   "
2016-06-27,Son N,5,0,"The course is helpful for me. It gives me an overall view of what's happening inside every click of mouse on web browser. Through this course I've learned about XML, JSON, how to parse those data, how to use and request API and many useful things.
Thank you Dr. Chuck for your series Python class."
2019-05-07,Екатерина Б,5,0,"A very useful course and with great explanations by Dr Chuck, high quality material and good content of the lectures. The course is more difficult than the previous two but it's great that it is challenging. Mentors helped me with the guidance when I was stuck on some assignments. Thanks a lot!"
2019-03-28,Nikita L,5,0,"I would like to have more assignments and more different tasks as often your assignment is just change 3 lines. Maybe it can be not mandatory as for some people is enought to learn to change just a few lines, but I would like to be able to practice more as part of the course and not on my own."
2016-01-03,Daniel B,5,0,"Everything good explained, even if u would be a beginner. Earlier it took me much time to learn these concepts from different sources in web. Dr Chuck explaines this all (call webservises per APIs, JSON, XML, XML schemes etc) in a very vivid manner in this collection of videos.  Recommendable."
2020-06-09,Suri S V S Y R,5,0,Lecture were easy to follow and intuitive. Assignments were well designed and challenging. Made the student think about how to solve it rather than just copying the structure of the sample code and change bits and pieces. Got a deeper understanding of the logical process of accessing the web. 
2020-05-09,MAHENDRANATH V K,5,0,"Learnt lot of stuffs on how python interacts with the outer world of internet, exchanging data of various formats through different web services approaches like REST ans SOAP. Retrieved information from Google and Twitter APIs. Our instructor's guidance was tremendous! Thanks a ton Dr.Chuck!"
2020-04-26,Arun P,5,0,"So Helpful!!!!!!!!
I learned a lot of Stuff and GeoJSON is awesome, all that API stuff is simply cool
I love PYTHON

I totally encourage everyone to take this course!"
2019-11-07,Mayank G,5,0,"Dr. Chuck has made assignments very easy with his demonstrated examples. So much information packaged succinctly, my goodness only a True Teacher can do that. BTW, looking at the comparison of the Java books' thickness, I'm tempted to learn Java as well after Python. Thank you Dr. Chuck. "
2016-02-01,SG,5,0,"The whole Python for Everyone Sequence is Awesome.
Each of the individual sections has been exceptional.
Section 3 of 4  - This course Accessing Web Data and Section 4 of 4 ( DataBase ) were the main reasons for me taking the course.

I would highly recommend the Python for Everyone  Series."
2019-05-05,Jesse C,5,0,"Outstanding course! I began this course a week ago after completing the first 2 in the series coming in with just basic programming knowledge and I can't believe after this course I can now begin working with APIs, have an understanding of parsing/reading XML and JSON. Highly recommend!"
2019-01-28,Annie F,5,0,"The course was excellent and specifically admire the way Dr. Chuck teaches so effortlessly, that we understand the concepts very clearly. The assignments are also very helpful in practicing what we have learnt, and gives us the confidence to work on real-time projects. Thanks Dr. Chuck."
2017-08-21,Hongfei C,5,0,The third session of the Python course is more difficult than the first two sessions and is quite a great challenge! But the courses for Dr.Chuck and the help of every mentors give me more energy to dive into it to get to understand every details. Programming is really interesting area!
2020-08-29,Hanna A,5,0,"This course is structured very well. The lessons are easy to follow and understand. Dr Chuck's lecture videos are very fun to watch. The book is pretty much self explanatory so you can use it as a reference or independently. Overall, the course and the specialization are pretty great!!  "
2019-08-22,Hossam G,5,0,"This was a great course but i have one big problem that encountered me 
Dr Chuck reads the code from power point sheets and even if there was a worked example he is only read the code and run yes he explain it but i need to learn how and why i write this code not just see it and run it "
2016-01-05,Sinan Y,5,0,"It was Amazing! Thousands thanks to Dr-Chuck, fellow classmates & of course all these great people in the bonus videos.
I have started my programming adventure with Dr-Chuck and now there is a burning desire to keep going. It is highly recommended to get this course.
All the best,
Sinan."
2019-02-15,David K,5,0,"This is great course, and more difficult then previous . It  introduces JSON , XML, and other modules which are very important in Python programming. This is intro in web programming, where students could explore other modules in Python. Thanks Dr. Chuck for well explained materials!"
2017-12-06,Giselle d C S B,5,0,"This was an excellent course. I really enjoyed to learn about ""Using Python to Access Web Data"".

2017-09-18,Vikas R,5,0,"this is a fantastic course!!! i don't have words to say about it but i must say to those who are going to take this course that you guy's have a lot fun, knowledge in this course i must thank to dr. chuck and all the team members specially to Tamara Brunnock who cleared all my doubts "
2015-12-23,Yonglei H,5,0,"This session is the most interesting one since I enrolled this series of Python program studying. The technology I learned here opened the door of using Python to organize and catch data from web. There must be big land behind and I want to pay a visit, by additional work after this. 
"
2020-09-08,Yusuf Y,5,0,This is a very demanding course packed with a lot of content. Think the effort is grossly underestimated here as it took much longer for me to complete the course. Most of the time spent was in trouble shooting and so would help if there is more guidance or resources made available. 
2020-07-31,Jose B G,5,0,"This  course is great for people who want to learn web scrapng using Python, and Dr. Chuck is amazing in explaining  basics related to Web. I would recommend anybody who is taking this course to take the Internet History course for better understanding(the pdf is freely available)."
2019-07-06,Nguyen D H A,5,0,"Great course! Dr Chuck explained the concepts very well, everything was easy to understand and the materials were just enough to get me hit the ground running but not overloaded with information. The assignments were well-thought to help me remember and understand course materials."
2015-11-28,Evaldas I,5,0,"It appears, during this course I'm becoming hungry for Python programming. Somehow weird but also very attractive programming language. Especially when I succeed in doing something in so called ""pythonic"" way. And thanks to professor. It's a real pleasure to listen to his lecture."
2021-11-08,Han T,5,0,It's a wonderful feeling to have finally come up with the correct answer (that matches the two ending numbers given as cue) in each graded external tool assignment. I like thinking upon the examples explained in the videos to get the inspiration needed for working out a solution. 
2020-05-18,Drew C,5,0,"I liked this course. It teaches useful skills and the coding tasks all seem appropriately pitched in difficulty. I am realizing that I'm now beginning to think about coding all the time. I worked on the class every day, and I feel like I'm building my mental ""coding muscles"" lol. "
2017-04-04,Crystal A,5,0,"It felt really neat to be able to call web data. It's starting to feel like what I'm learning will be useful in my job and life now. Dr. Chuck makes things easy to understand, but the assignments generally contain enough tricks to guarantee that you understand the subject matter."
2019-06-09,Wayne H G J,5,0,"This was an excellent class that furthered my knowledge of programming with Python.  I have a great foundation of accessing APIs and pulling down either XML or JSON.  Super happy I took this class, I look forward to completing the final two courses in this Python specialization."
2016-01-26,Abhishek M,5,0,"The course is both fun and full of learning. Dr Chuck is a wonderful teacher. He puts forth concepts in a way that is easy to relate and in absorb-able chunks. Still he manage to impart sufficient knowledge for us to start coding interesting applications. Thanks a ton, Dr Chuck.
"
2021-10-15,Natalie W,5,0,"W​hen it was time to learn more Python, I was happy to see Dr. Chuck on Coursera as I took a PHP/MySQL class with him a decade ago during graduate school. Dr. Chuck has a highly engaging teaching style and I'd highly recommend learning from him, online or IRL. Thanks Dr. Chuck!"
2015-12-06,Igor S,5,0,"
This was a short but very good introduction to APIs and Python's ability to retrieve data from the web.
The load is quite low, so my suggestions to the teacher would be: make it harder! Include more examples and make both quizes and assignments harder in the same amount of time.
"
2021-08-04,Miguel S,5,0,"Hello everyone, 
If you have interest in learning Python with an excellent academic format this is the place for you, all the Specialization is thinking in learning by doing with the all exercises are designed to apply the knowledge of the module, and the professor is awesome."
2021-03-26,Alex V,5,0,Great course taught at a very good pace for someone like myself with prior background in web programming.

2015-12-02,Raysong L,5,0,"
Using Python to Access Web Data, like its two prerequisites, is a five star couse. It was fun, like the name of the course, to use Python to access web data. I did not know that before. It was a little harder than the two prerequisites, but it was a good course. Thank you, Dr."
2021-01-19,林聖智,5,0,"The first time I used python and xml, json to transfer data, although it failed several times in the middle, but after watching the video again, it seems to have a better understanding. Of course, I have to study a few more times to truly understand the operation of the data."
2021-01-11,Harald M,5,0,"The course is excellent in delivering good teaching to enable the student to quickly and effectively grasp all the concepts and become proficient in their application in short time (e.g., how to access web data). Highly effective in becoming competent in using Python quickly.  "
2018-05-25,Ge O,5,0,The past two weeks has been fantastic! Dr Chuck is Clear with course content and he has a good sense of humour which made the course quite enjoyable. Python skills from the course are practical and lay good foundations for me to further study processing web data with Python.
2016-01-23,Evan G,5,0,Absolutely fantastic. Dr. Chuck's teaching style is completely in-sync with my learning style. The content is clearly presented and the effort in teaching shows. Thank you Dr. Chuck for taking the time to present this material and for creating the tools for all of us to use.
2019-01-19,Max B,5,0,"Dr. Chuck strikes again -- another great course for everybody wanting to know more about accessing data through Python! It helps to have gone through the other courses prior to this, but the lectures are easy to follow and the assignments on accessible level. Two thumbs up!"
2018-07-22,Jens,5,0,"I'm halfway into this course and i can recommend it to anybody who wants to get into python. While the first few chapters where pretty easy (i had a very small coding experience) it gets pretty challenging for me. I really like that, it's pretty rare in such courses i feel. "
2015-11-25,Rajesh C,5,0,"Very helpful to understand the python APIs to access the web data and how to parse the XML and JSON formats.  The course presentation was friendly and easy to follow.  The assignments were covering the python in detail.  Overall very useful and highly recommended.

Thank you."
2021-01-19,Danny Z,5,0,"i took this for refresh training, and as expected, the course and the way Dr. Chuck giving the lecture is intresting.  Moreover,  in this way I known more about the data structure and intellegent practice.  Great, and I have recommanded the courses to my peers and friends."
2020-06-28,SRIPARNO S,5,0,"This is a great course, all the topics taught are very much relevant to the modern tech world. Only one thing is to be noted that, the last week on JSON  should have more worked examples regarding a little bit complicated probelms. The overall explanation was simply great."
2021-07-10,李昕諺,5,0,"The class is very interesting. I really enjoy in the course. the course teach me how to use python to access web data. the way increases my work efficiency. Furthermore, I also learned the basic concepts of XML and JSON. They are useful. I love the class. Thank professor. "

2016-02-09,Justin G,5,0,"This course takes the student from beginner to novice. Easily the best course I've taken on Coursera so far. I'm also doing the Python for Everybody specialization and if you've taken any of Dr. Chuck's courses, you know he's hard to beat, but Dr. Matthew Yee-King did it."
2015-10-31,Adelina,5,0,"This course is very well organized and the best out of it is that all classes are in the course content. Therefore, you can finish the course faster if you have the time.
The lessons are very well explained and the method of teaching is the best.
 I am really happy with it."
2016-04-21,Yumei L,5,0,"Love this course. I took the first two (as one course), learned a lot (and worked really hard, since I started from scratch). But this one brings the coding part to the web and suddenly gives the whole experience a different dimension. Mind-opening. That's why I like it."
2016-03-09,Matthew T,5,0,"Very good course to build on basic knowledge of python. Content is accessible, lectures are well presented and easy to understand. Using python for tasks such as web scraping shows the potential of python whilst still being fairly accessible for the majority of students.
"
2020-04-09,Saman M A M,5,0,"This chapter was truly helpful, as an engineer you have to understand how computers are communicating with each other via the internet, rest systems and APIs are part of this process which were covered in this chapter. Thank you Dr.Chuck for being the amazing professor. "
2020-11-08,Habib A,5,0,"Thank You dr Chuck for the great courses. I am working on my final project as a student at Sumatera Institute of Technology (Indonesia). This course helps me a lot since i am working on data scraping through marketplaces, and build a recommender system from these data."

I highly recommend it :)"
2020-03-22,荆天泽,5,0,"  Compared to the previous two courses, this course is relatively much more hard, and more useful. With the clear instructions of the teacher, I am now able to use python to get access to data from the web. I am sure this will help me a lot in my future life and career.  "
2019-11-16,Anna T,5,0,Looking back at when I started and could barely write 3 line code I understand how simply amazing this course is. I can see progress and my knowledge grew so much thanks to all materials that are provided by  Dr. Chuck. Can't wait to go further in this specialization.
2019-09-05,kuldeep s,5,0,"course its self quit self explanatory but i like to add few things
1 - Need little bit explanation how to use real life scenario
2 - JSON part is quit short but now a days JSON is big thing, so i suggest please keep eye on current trends and elaborate topic accordingly.   "
2018-01-09,Robin P,5,0,"The assignments are becoming more and more difficult. But very rewarding when you finally get the solution. It's very important to understand every line of code from the previous chapters. 
But again, very well explained (also by the assistants in the discussion forum)"
2019-09-03,Jonathan L,5,0,"I was greatly engaged and challenged by this course. Each week of work has only one or two assignments, but they all require careful attention to the lecture and the code provided to complete the tests. I am very glad for the material provided and the examples given. "
2019-06-28,Gisael G,5,0,"I really enjoyed this course. I am not really good at finishing MOOCs but this one is different. I really love Dr. Chuck's passion for teaching and appreciate all the effort he and his team had put on his book, materials, and assignments. This course is unbelievable. "
2017-11-19,Ryan R,5,0,"Definitely a novice level, but appropriately paced, course introducing web data fundamentals. The course gradually implements key ""Pythonic"" modules that allow you to connect to websites--parsing and extracting their real-world data! Well taught Dr. chuck, thank you!"
2020-05-04,Brandon M,5,0,In my opinion this serves as a good introductory course for web services; it doesn't really delve deeper into the abundant knowledge needed to become a professional but it keeps it masterfully focused on the topic (Python) and Dr. Chuck's explanations are very good
2020-04-13,Essam Q,5,0,"This course was fun and not hard to understand, because Dr. Charles has a great way of simplifying the concepts, and the assignments were great and effective. Also a great thing is that the course have a clear vision of where you are in the path of learning Python.  "
2017-01-14,Casey C,5,0,"Great course.  If you want to know some of the basic of how to get data from the web (web scraping, api's) and how to use that data (json, xml), this course if for you.  Dr. Chuck uses primarily python, but many api's and the data structures are language agnostic."
2019-07-26,NI,5,0,"The assignments were more difficult than the previous courses and I literally have to pull all of my limited Python knowledge to finish it.  The journey was not easy but because of these assignments, I am now feeling much more comfortable with Python than before."
2019-03-28,MARIN P,5,0,"This course covers a lot of different material and is, in my opinion, more difficult than the previous two Python courses offered in this specialization.
Overall, very good. The only critique I have would be to clarify some of the instructions for the assignments."
2016-10-26,Sam Z,5,0,"I was shocked when I saw the inventor of Python from this course. But now I got used to see any inventors of Internet. After you met those Internet Inventors, you felt anything about Internet is simple. 
The way Prof. thought was very fun and easy to learn. Great!"
2020-10-24,Ananya S ,5,0,"Once I got started with courses by Dr Chuck, I haven't been able to resist doing all of them. I love his courses and I'm so grateful that I could learn more in a few weeks than I'd previously managed in several months. Thank you, Dr Chuck. Coursera is a godsend. "
2020-06-20,YUJIAO H,5,0,"It is kind of diffiicult for me since I don't know  anything about web service. I think it will be nice if there can be some recommendation of books or videos to learn the basic knowledge of web service. Still, thank you professor for giving a such great course."
2018-11-19,Shivam I,5,0,"This course introduces to the Json, XML and other python modules which are very fundamental to Web programming. Professor has nicely covered all important topics and the course gives a start that one needs to take interest and learn more about different modules."
2018-10-03,Vaibhav K,5,0,"The course is great.
There's just one thing i always crave for in this specialization, there are only limited Graded Courses that are really challenging.
(one of them was such a mess, i couldn't proceed for 5 days.)
The exercises are really fun. Highly recommended."
2017-07-12,Alejandro M,5,0,"It is an excellent course (as the previous ones).
The lectures and examples are very helpful.
I already work as a Programmer and courses like this help me improve my skills even further by learning from other people experiences.
Thanks Dr Check and Teaching Staff!!"
2016-01-02,Doug J,5,0,Charles Severance is perhaps the greatest instructor of a programming language that I have ever encountered.  Not only are the lectures engaging but the assignments are relevant and I have been able to apply what I have learned immediately to my day to day life.
2021-06-12,Adib B,5,0,"Thanks Coursera
Thank you so much Dr. Severance
and Thanks University of Michigan

The third part of the course is a good introduction to the capability of Python in writing search codes and in scraping the web and other applications. Assignments are more difficult to tackle than in the previous two courses probably because the materials needed to solve them were either not well explained or were explained in later lessons. For example, the instruction for a particular assignment gave a starting sample code that was claimed to be the closest to the code to do the assignment, a statement that turned out to be wrong. It was not close to it at all. This area should be looked into for future learners. The learners' minds should be prepared from the beginning that there might be a need to go outside the course materials to tackle some assignments. 
 
Overall, again, the course is an excellent introduction to what Python can do in search programs using regular expressions and in scraping the web and other applications. To be very good at these topics, like any other courses, learners will need extensive practice on their own, as most of the assignments were completed through a hand-holding technique using the provided sample codes.  
 
Overall, I am happy with what I am learning in python programming, and perhaps, I would use this new knowledge to work as a web developer someday. Thank you, Dr Charles, University of Michigan, and Coursera. Keep up the good work of providing affordable and accessible education.

This is the third of 5 courses in Python 2.7, so the full 5 courses are 
excellent for a Beginner to become a solid Intermediate, this Web Access
 course alone should only be taken by those with some Python programming
 experience (like the prior 2 beginning courses on programming and data 
structures in Python).

I did the course using Python 3.5, from Anaconda, after starting the 
more challenging MIT 6.00 courses (2 of them), which use 3.5 but are 
faster paced yet with more challenging problems. [Some issues switching 
from 2.7 to 3.5 -- there now is a revised Open Source book using py3x]

Dr. Chuck's course offers true high quality learning but allowing me to 
work my 40 hrs /week and do the course, altho it took me two sessions to
 finish. 

Now fully completed after switching to the next later session. 

NOTE - these MOOCs allow one to switch to the next session when one 
falls behind; this is better for getting TA help in the forums when 
there is a problem.

Thanks! 
(above is same as Class Central, below is new)
  How could it be improved?  By having for each required assignment a similar but more difficult optional assignment, which can be further discussed in the forums.  I'd expect that switching auto-grade assignments & sample code to be py3.5, especially the print() change, would be fairly easy and allow students to choose which version to do the assignment it.

2017-06-12,suzy s,4,0,"I really appreciate all of Dr. Chuck's lectures and courses. On this one though, I missed the 'picture in picture' feature of the slides- in courses 1 & 2 the slide content was always visible (with Dr. Chuck lecturing in a split screen), but in this course the content is interlaced with the video of Dr. Chuck, and it makes it harder to see what's going on with the code and his annotations when it's flipping back and forth between his face and what he's doing. I didn't know how much I appreciated that slide format until it was gone! I also prefer the long (40min/lecture) format, as opposed to all these short units as separate video things-- it made it much harder to go back and find/rewatch something because I couldnt remember what short segment the topic was covered in, as opposed to just searching a giant transcript. Also (maybe this is just me?) the links to navigate within the course aren't there (just below the floating 'coursera' header), so I had to constantly go to the home page and re-find my place after submitting assignments- extra aggravating with the increased number of shorter videos. But, I felt content is 5/5 as always- just didn't like the new presentation format. I write this only as feedback, not a complaint, I'm truly very grateful and pleased with the courses."
2021-12-14,Peter K,4,0,"Although considerably harder than the first two courses, it is still mostly well explained and worthy of 4 stars. Where it falls down is in the JSON section I think.  Although I agree that XML is richer, it is not harder to use: in fact, I think it is easier (but that may be my bias of 25 years' exposure to SGML/XML with a language that processes SGML/XML *brilliantly* but is almost exclusive to publishing (OmniMark).  The JSON nested dictionaries and lists are just plain confusing and hard to read IMHO and if you did not have the sample code it would be very hard to complete the first assignment of Week 6.  The bit that Chuck fails to point out about XML is that it has an inherent bias to handling complex *documents* rather than extracts of repetitive data.  It is impossible to mimic Docbook or any other complex document with JSON, and it was a bit annoying that this key point was omitted (or at least I don't recall it being pointed out - all that was said was JSON is better, easier, preferrable, etc.). Overall though, this was a very good course again, though if you had little expeience of either XML or JSON, you could struggle and/or will take longer to fathom this course."
2020-08-11,Robert E,4,0,"Some of the instructions for the assignments were vague.  For example, I spent entirely too much time trying to use regular expressions with the first Beautiful Soup assignment.  I eventually found a staff post in the discussion forum saying not to use regular expressions, but that information would have been very helpful in the assignment's instructions, especially given that substantial video lecture time was spent on regular expressions.  Also, I think the time estimates for assignment completion were unrealistic (and unnecessary) in this course.  In the first two courses of the Python for Everybody specialization, I finished all of the lectures and assignments much quicker than the estimated time.  In this course, it took me much longer than the estimated time.  On the whole, though, I'm very pleased with the course.  I learned far more effectively than I would have by just reading a book on Python."
2017-02-04,A-A-ron,4,0,"Once again, another excellent course from Dr. Chuck. However, the Coursera format has changed from that of the previous two courses and the submission of quizzes and assignments are now locked; they don't show progress or get marked as completed unless you purchase the certification. So, if you're auditing the course, don't bother with the quizzes and don't expect the course to show your progress (mine still says I'm on week one) or be marked as completed in your profile even though you've watched all the videos and submitted the assignments.Dr. Chuck, I understand that University of Michigan has to find a way to monetize these courses. However, since the previous courses used auto graders, and this course seems to as well, I'd like to request that the quiz and assignment features be unlocked so auditors can see course progress and completion like the previous two courses."
2017-03-29,Duke B,4,0,"Now we're cooking with gas. This is course three of five in the University of Michigan's Python for Everybody series and things start to become real.  Where Course 1 was very action/reaction in learning Python's basics, Course 2 was more abstract (and the weakest of the three so far), Course 3 builds on the other two and you get to taste Python's real world potential.  Granted, this is all an introduction series and nobody is walking away from these courses into a full time developer position - but you do begin feel functionally dangerous (in a good way).  The biggest takeaway from the course is giving you that taste of what is possible.  We don't know how to do it yet (and the course isn't going to go beyond the intro depth) but after this third course you're likely getting smitten by Python and know you want to avidly take your learning beyond this series."
2020-06-14,Kazi N A S,4,0,"This course, unlike the previous ones, seemed a little boring, to be honest, but maybe that's because this is the very first time I was introduced to many topics (even though I'm a current computer science student) that were taught in this course. Another thing is that it was more about using the codes that are already given and modify them to get the desired output. Because of that, I'm still not sure whether I have to learn or memorize all of the lines written in a particular file or I'd be well of just by knowing what line of code is doing what and by being able to modify and use them to get the work done. Google Maps and Twitter API is also shown in this course, so hopefully in the future when I will be I need to use them, I'll rewatch the videos and follow up with the sample code. Overall, it was a good experience."
2021-08-08,Thomas Z,4,0,"I enjoyed the subject matter of this course, and Dr. Chuck is a great teacher, however I have a nitpick to make about the assignments.

I understand that writing similar code several times can be monotonous and sometimes we were required to use some code we weren't fully taught yet, but being provided sample code to edit frustrated me for more than it was worth. I would much prefer to stumble through the learning process myself than try to make sense of new information in code I had nothing to do with. I spent much longer trying to process what was going on in the sample code than actually solving the assigned problems.

A word of advice for anyone with a brain like mine: It is easier and better for learning if you try your best to write your code from scratch and only look at the sample code for guidance if you get stuck."
2020-01-20,Christian W,4,0,"Overall another good course. It was perhaps not as complete at the end earlier on in the course. The last section on APIs was sometime confusing or at least glossed over some programming constructs. However, Chuck Severance has a difficult balancing act to perform. On the one hand he has tried very had to make Python programming accessible to new-coders while at the same time providing a useful and usable introduction to some very powerful concepts and methods. Overall I think he is doing an outstanding job and provides a very good basis to build on. As a bonus, I  think the interviews with the computer science & internet tech luminaries are outstanding! Great to hear directly from folks who contributed so much to the development of the field."
2020-05-20,M.Shoyeb S,4,0,"  The difficulty in this course was highly pumped up comparing the previous two courses, the balancing wheels were taken off and the learner is subtlety led into the direction of reading documentation of modules or google them to get a detailed understanding of them.though i struggled a bit through the XML assignment i can mostly understand the courses approach as to why worked assignments are not the answer to every problem, unless we struggle a bit to solve the assignments, in my opinion it wont stick with you.to get a quick gist of xml and json this course is on point but if you're looking to get in-depth knowledge i would recommend taking some more elaborative courses in these technologies, overall it was sufficient.  "
2016-11-13,Elena S,4,0,"I moved to the US a couple years ago and started my career from scratch in completely different sphere - Quality Assurance. I never supposed myself to be a technical person and felt uncomfortable with IT things. I have in my head the combination of tech terms and tools mixed up with huge gaps, this course helped me to systematize my knowledge and feel more confident and engaged with what I am doing. I completed 3/4 sessions and would rate the first two 5 stars, and probably give a little bit less, 4 stars, to the third one, only because sometimes I had to find on the Internet additional materials which were not covered by lecture and course materials to complete my assignments."
2019-08-29,Bhargava S K D V,4,0,"Dr. Chuck is great! I've been his fan for years! The assignments are rigid. 
Here is my only concern:
Why do I have to use the libraries that are recommended by Dr. Chuck. Can't I chose my own? I encountered some problems with 'urllib' module. I wanted to complete this course in a few days. I could complete all my assignments without having to install urllib, but for the last assignment, the assignment did not accept a solution I came up with 'requests' module. I had to crack my head open to fix the issues with that library, then submit the assignment. It was totally unnecessary. In real world scenarios, I've always used 'requests'. I've only used 'urllib' once or may be twice. "
2020-07-08,Raghav B,4,0,"Overall, this is a good course for a person new to Python programming like me. The stuff is broken down into simpler terms and is explained properly. The thing that I expected was to include all the data structures that we learned in 1st and 2nd courses to be applied, and slowly build up the difficulty level. The initial part till the XML was good, and the difficulty level was increasing. Then suddenly, more theory about Json and API got occupied, and less about data structure manipulation. Besides, I skipped all the bonus lectures, and for a person who's truly interested to solve Python, that's totally unnecessary. Keep only the required videos and remove the rest, please."
2017-03-13,Antoine C,4,0,"Dr. Chuck's explanations are clear and all the lessons are easy to follow: focus on relevant web technologies, perfect pace, examples based on popular APIs. As someone with some basic knowledge in programming already I was expecting the assignments to be more challenging. As clearly announced on the website this course is targeted at beginners who took the previous courses from the same teacher: all exercises can be solved in about 10-15 lines of code and the solutions can be directly applied from the videos without much further thinking. The rest of you will, like me, breeze through it in no time. Kudos for the interesting interview videos proposed as bonus material!"
2016-03-15,Jane C,4,0,"There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters. It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming. Yes, a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot, but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality! Also, I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there (documentation, etc.) could help them. Also, as the students start have to read multiple docs, etc. the time expectations per week should be increased. "
2016-01-16,Timothy S,4,0,"great energy and great class. 
1. nice assignment website, but it could use a bit file up-load and nosetest to held automate grading.  
2. I wish they have more web robot, crawling, interesting problem examples.
3. peer review would be nice, so a better read-able pythonic programming style can be nurtured.
4. wondering if the course grading website can be done in ipython notebook. 
4. I guess the instructor mention using RESTful, it could be also nice to have an assignment or 
    project to make a REST server with some database(sql-ed or sql-less). 
    After all there a are lot of big data out there to be accessed and processed. 
"
2020-09-06,Chris S,4,0,"Great course that gets you to the point where you can start to do interesting things with computers in the context of the web in the MINIMUM amount of time possible.  This focus on keeping the time commitment required to reach an interesting place down to a minimum is great because it enhances the  chances of course completion. The flip side is you will need to do more on your own to reach ""industrial strength"" knowledge.  (A great compromise in my view)

The course could be improved by providing a few more recommendations of high quality learning resources for going deeper (later) in each topic"
2016-01-11,Akash T,4,0,"
An extremely well-structured and useful course. As someone who had only syntactical familiarity with Python, this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language. Moreover, the technical knowledge included (APIs, RegEx, etc) is highly relevant and practical.
Given that it's part of an introductory series, the difficulty level of the assignments is understandable. But providing some more rigorous optional assignments can be a welcome addition to the course.
That being said, I would recommend it to anyone looking to explore Python and the power it grants with its simplicity. "
2017-06-04,Tiago F S,4,0,"
  Using Python to Access Web Data is a good and short course, but do not expect to go deep, as it is a part of the Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python), and not an advanced course on programming. It is an excellent course for getting a taste of using Python to access data on the web.The course only lacks more live coding with more difficult examples, so the student could see a real programmer line of thought.I've used Python 3, the examples are not hard to port to Python 3, and if you are stuck trying to use Python try you can ask for help in the Python community."
2020-08-16,Mark J O,4,0,"Very good introduction to how to scrape the web and how data is transferred on the web. Dr. Severance is an excellent instructor.
That said, I can't give this course a 5/5 because it still uses the urllib.request module to make 'Get' requests, when the 'requests' module is far simpler and possibly faster. I appreciated learning how to access data using the 'socket' module because it seems to give a more nuanced understanding of what's going on when you send a 'get' request, but I don't see any reason not to use requests.get() instead of urllib.request.urlopen()."
2020-03-11,Diep T,4,0,"I find the target of the course, to use Python to access web data, extremely useful. Been always wondered how to do it, and now at the end of the course, I've made myself familiar with these techniques. The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star is I feel like it can made more focused by giving a lot more practice and examples about what we will actually use, and maybe forget about scratching the surface when mentioning the lower level of http. I find it sort of frustrating just copy and past some lines of codes from the lecture and didn't really know it is. "
2019-12-05,Lecker D,4,0,"I think the course has some room for improvement, e.g. the quiz questions eps. in the first couple of weeks didn't exactly seem to fit with the content of the videos - this was different in previous courses. If additional reading of the textbook materials was required, it should have been explicitly mentioned. Also, their are some hickups with the disconnect between the content of the videos and the actual state of the google and twitter API, but I think for the assignements it was nicely solved, so no issue there. Overall very content with the course."
2021-07-11,Nikki T,4,0,"This course was definitely a bit more challenging than the previous 2 course, but at the same time, it was extremely exciting to be learning so much more and the applications of it. You get to learn a lot more difficult coding and see how it applies to the real world. Professor Severance is such a wonderful professor! I wish I actually had come across this course sooner in my life because I wouldn't had wasted my time paying thousands of dollars to a University that puts no effort into their students learning at all. Cheers to Professor Severance :) "
2017-10-08,André C V,4,0,"Very instructive and interesting. Was able to understand the basic of Web Data and will be able to easily get deeper into it if I wish so after having a solid basic knowledge.

I do, however, have a couple of constrcutive comments:
1st - Is it possible to release a couple of commented alternative solutions to the graded assignments to those who have already passed it? This would help us students to learn even more.

2nd- Please keep the Quiz questions solely to contents discussed on the video lectures. (some questions were not discussed in the videos)"
2018-10-08,Alessandra T C,4,0,"Sadly in comparison with the first two courses of this specialization in 'Using Python to Access Web Data' the difficulty increases exponentially. For me it was definitely harder to keep the pace with all the infos. Instead of the office hours and the interviews to VIPs and other relevant people to the field I'd like to see more worked exercises. Also, after May 25 2018 both Google and Twitter changed their policies about the retrieval of data. So it was impossible to follow the instuctions step by step on how to build an API in Twitter."
2021-01-04,Gregory  L,4,0,"Quite good material and presentation, with two caveats.
First, the TA is terrible. They respond rudely and with a great deal of condescension to nearly every comment they make. Avoid interacting with them if you can.
Second, some of the templates for assignments have significantly more sophisticated approaches than are necessary to complete the assignments. You might learn the most by starting from scratch each time, but nonetheless I think Dr. Chuck is a pretty great teacher. He really makes you feel like you can do this. And he's right!"
2022-06-29,Richard C,4,0,"It's a good course, but I think I had some issues with parts of it.  I passed everything, but I can't help but think that I really don't know what I did most of the time.  The exercises mostly involved modifying a given file to parse some kind of data from a given url.  I could do it each time, but I don't think I learned how to do this well enough to do it again without having a script to use as a template.  
There are a few places where the videos didn't feel like they prepared me for the exercises.  It was just kind of frustrating.  "
2017-05-18,Calvin B,4,0,"I loved this course, however, there is some room for improvement:
(a) Putting code side-by-side with video of Dr Chuck (like it was done in previous lectures) would be better.

(b) Make the end-of-week assignments more challenging.  I felt that the quizzes were good, but, the coding assignments were too easy and the solution was practically spoon fed.

Other than that, the course was really good.  Dr Chuck is a natural in front of the camera.  I also really enjoyed some of the more complex code samples presented during the lectures."
2017-10-27,Jason A,4,0,"Great coverage of the material, however some of the sample scripts were nearly complete and required little, if any, modification to complete the assignment. They clearly tried to find the balance between providing challenging exercises and providing working packages of scripts so that students can accomplish more complicated tasks using additional tools that are, on their own, beyond the scope of the project. I just think they could have provided a bit less to make some of the later exercises a bit more challenging."
2019-04-18,Hyun K,4,0,I found this course to be a lot harder than the previous 2 (which is not an issue per se). I feel like I understand a much smaller proportion of the content than the other courses and I am having to copy a lot of code without truly understanding what they achieve (I merely know that I must for the code to function properly).  The last task in particular didn't even require me to change any of the code from 'you will write a python program somewhat similar to... '. Was I supposed to write all of that from scratch?
2022-04-03,Justin R,4,0,"This course is definitely a great introduction to how Python can interact with web data. Towards the end it gets a bit overwhelming because of the complexity of dealing with APIs, but I feel like I came away with the fundamental skillset necessary if I wanted to explore the topics further. I appreciated that the assignments emphasized the way key programming concepts from prior courses apply to these topics (instead of sending students down rabbit holes of understanding the nitty gritty of pulling web data)."
2021-09-14,Cheng C C,4,0,"As a beginner to coding, I was lost at the week 2 assignment. 
I don't even know where to construct my code and test it at first. I was struggling for days and searching for further help on the Internet.
It would be great if there is a guide for where to put the code, where and how to save the code file.
In addition, Dr. Chuck is trying to squeeze too much content into one course in my opinion.
However, it's a fantastic course overall and I enjoyed it!!! Appreciate everyone's effort on preparing this course :)"
2020-06-07,PAPHON S,4,0,"This course is like a new territory compared to the two courses before. The first course is simple and easy. the second course is a little bit confusing. This course is very very confusing(the teaching is good, but the knowledge is very new to me). But being confusing is not bad, I've learned many new things from this course and the confusion i got from this course encourages me to go back to review this course and previous course before jumping into the next course and get more confused. Good course!"
2020-02-26,akash p,4,0,"The course was good. I got to learn so much things, though it was introductory and just basic in nature but it gave me an idea that what I can do next. 
I learnt Regex, parsing data using XML and JSON and Beautiful Soup. I think that there needs to be a little more depth to these topics. Though it was overall a good experience my suggestion would be to include a project at last that requires to do a real world problem solving where the students can apply their knowledge on each of the skills learnt."
2016-06-29,titus l,4,0,"This course got very technical very suddenly which was really fun! From normal python to regular expression python, to surfing the web with python (by suddenly writing a web browser) and then suddenly using python to leverage on APIs. Each chapter is a really fun quantum leap in understanding!
However, I felt that the lectures could be better delivered for that chapter (less wordy, chunky notes, more examples) because it's really a whole new world each time.
Really worth the time and effort though!"
2020-05-28,Kanishtha D,4,0,The twitter api chapters confused me a lot during the later stages. But i think the assignments and quizzes are very very well thought for such a complex set of topics otherwise students just get lost and get stuck at some assignments and quit altogether! 1 star deducted because i thought Dr. Chuck could have explained the worked twitter api assignment in a better way as he got stuck in some places and it confused me lot at that moment! However the exercise made things very clear so over happy!
2017-01-07,Francesco B,4,0,"Nice course, you get an introduction to using python to access different types of widely used formats of web data. 
I liked that, apart from showing how to ""get the stuff done"" with Python, the course also explores a bit of the history of each of the tyeps explored and tries to ""scratch the surface"" about how each of them works.
On the down side: I think the code already provided for each assignment is too much. One ends up not writing his/her own code, if not for a couple of additional lines. "
2018-05-28,Tan Y H J,4,0,"Professor Chuck could have reviewed the more difficult concepts in greater detail or by providing more worked examples. For example, in the quiz for Week 6, the concepts of REST and SOAP were not covered in the presentation slides but were tested in the quiz. In the HTML week, I found the assignments hard because of inadequate knowledge of the various tags which exist in html code. This is a challenging course but not impossible to learn. More resources would be greatly appreciated, though."
2022-05-15,Ruoming Z,4,0,"First of all, I have to say the courses from Charles Russell Severance always remain high quality, and the learning process (except for the assignment part) is pretty enjoyable. After three courses of PY4E, I feel excited to acquire systematic knowledge.

Second, this course is a little bit difficult for a ""newbie"" like me. More detailed explanations would be appreciated, as we can absorb the knowledge easier and become more confident.

Thanks for the fantastic lectures from cute Dr.Chuck!"
2020-09-05,Aarya P,4,0,"The course deals with how to get data off a website. Basically helps in  parsing different types of data in the JSON and XML . Its a little difficult for those first timers but eventually you will get to know some of the stuff . It would have helped if it would have been a little easier. 

The Instructor is great and let me go ahead and tell you that he is one of the best,  but some concepts in this course were pretty difficult for me to understand. You have to work a bit to get hold of it.  "
2017-06-21,Dumidu H,4,0,"A well thought out course which goes above and beyond just teaching you how to code python. You get to hear from some of the pioneers, shapers, and creators of network related technologies on how they were able to do the things they have done and how what they did changed the course of the technology. Pretty cool. 
Tip: Avoid using an IDE if you want remember what you learn better. The chances of something blowing up in your face is more but because of it you will remember better.  "
2015-11-14,Joel T,4,0,"This course is well-developed and well-delivered. If one is a complete novice, start at the beginning of this specialty on one's own schedule (on demand at the speed of light) and at an affordable price ($0) and be confident of significant advances in one's knowledge of internet function, in general, and Python, in particular. It is a brave new world. I often feel like Wylie Coyote staring through my toes. Suddenly realizing things have changed. This course fixes that feeling."
2021-01-25,Jeremy M,4,0,"Interesting topic.  There is a wealth of things to learn with respect to using Python to Access the Web.  The materials presented here just scratch the surface.  I enjoy the video lectures and book.  The assignments in this course are interesting, but wonder a little from the presented materials.  I am taking away 1 star due to a bug I encountered with the autograder in the final assignment and for the aforementioned discontinuities.  Overall, a fun class and I learned a lot."
2016-06-05,Levi M,4,0,"I really enjoyed this course and found that I am feeling more confident with my skills from the previous two. However, as a point of improvement I would suggest making the final module a bit more challenging. Perhaps this was intentional but, although the final module introduces JSON well, I don't feel as though my skills improved while doing it. (Then again, the counter argument could be that it is good practice and repetition before moving on to anything too much harder...)"
2020-03-24,Yinglu W,4,0,"This course is well structured. I really like how it introduces the high-level knowledge in the first 3 weeks and becomes more hands-on in the later of the class. My only complaint is some of the materials are out-dated. For example, lots of the tasks can be handled by urllib3 but urllib and urllib2 are heavily along the course. urllib3 is not just a simply upgrade from urllib2, it has a lot more functions. And the ""bonus materials"" section is bit lame to be honest."
2020-04-16,Santhosh C,4,0,"I am an Electrical Engineer with some experience in coding using MATLAB. I have completed the two courses in this specialization before this one.  A lot a material is covered and Dr Chuck has explained the important parts. Spending time on reading more material using the course syllabus as a guide would be very useful. Assignments in the middle of the course required plenty of time and effort, otherwise assignments are easy once you understand what is being asked."
2020-02-10,Johanna G,4,0,"This course was a good as the first two. Charles Severance is really a great instructor. As a total beginner in programming, this course was a bit harder for me than the first two ones, but through a lot of reading and tasks, you can easily follow the course. I rate this course with 4 stars because I would have liked to have a few more examples to explain and deepen the new content. But, to sum up - I can really recommend this course and want to say thank you!"
2016-03-03,Paul J M,4,0,"This course covers a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace. It's not going to teach every aspect of the subjects covered--it couldn't possibly do so in the time--but it teaches enough to allow students to ask the right questions later.
I would like to see more searching practical exercises to cement the learning. The existing assignments follow quite closely the worked examples which means those coding along with Dr chuck aren't going to have too much more to do."
2018-06-20,Tushar s,4,0,"This course is like, even if you are beginner you are brought to the advanced level learning materials easily. You wouldn't know that with such basic knowledge you can understand this course very well. You are honed with the skills with the excellent technologies and you will learn how to use it.Dr.Chuck and his team have done really a great job teaching stuff. They are absolutely great. His team is working hard to teach people stuff and correct their doubts."
2021-09-27,おう ふ,4,0,"I managed to pass the course all by myself (I am working full time in Tokyo, so I did not have enough time to search the forums), but I have to say that the assignments, especially the last several ones, were so difficult that I nealy failed. It would be much better if there are more practice problems or examples given and explained in the video or on the textbook. Nevertheless, Prof. Dr. Chuck is still a great lecturer, so the course earns a 4-star grade."
2019-10-05,RAJA G,4,0,"  Lecture videos were broken into small parts whereby it's easy to understand and digest. Assessment given were relevant to what was taught for each segment. Navigating around course contents were easy.But after i learned the course . it seems like a litter bit of difficult than previous two course. I commend that at the final of the course, the text should tend to more difficult so that people who learn this course can actually improve programming skill. 
 "
2020-04-10,Kamoliddin N,4,0,"Course is great! Good explanations and perfect slides. However at week 6 professor had some difficulty explaining twitter API. It was hard to understand even for students with experience in python. Also want to mention that course is for explanation purposes and for beginners. You will learn a lot and it is still not enough to go and get a job in this field. So after completing this course, you should take more advanced courses and learn more!"
2019-09-23,Garth G,4,0,This is a great course to get you started on using Python to access web data.  The course has lots of examples and Professor Severance breaks down the concepts into smaller components that are easy to learn.  It is highly recommended that students download the course material and review the code examples along with the presentations.  That pratical experience reinforced a deeper understanding that made the assignments much easier to complete.   
2015-12-06,Cesar D,4,0,"An amazing course content!! This is a very enjoyable course about Python language programming. Dr Chuck explains each topic with clarity, which facilitate the comprehension of Python from the beginning. In my personal point of view, I would like to have a more deeply exploration in topics. It could give more tools to learn and complexity to each assignment. The book as supported material is a very good resource for consult through all course."
2020-11-02,Elizabeth B,4,0,"I found the worked examples to often be overly abstracted from the assignments. This resulted in me needing to look up how to do problems because I was stumped, only to discover that it was very easy and would have been solvable if some key information had been included in the lectures. I walked away feeling frustrated and incompetent despite completing the assignments because I was never able to figure out how to do them entirely on my own. "
2016-01-12,David D R,4,0,"The course is great although a little bit simple or slow-paced. But since it is for beginners I think it is Ok the way it is. You will learn the foundations of accessing the Web Data, so it is a really great starting point. You will enjoy and you will want to learn even more!
Dr. Chuck is a great teacher whom I would loved to have at class. He explains things quite clearly, in a funny way and he transmits passion in what he is teaching."
2019-03-31,Xiaorong L,4,0,"In the last two weeks things started getting a bit too complicated and Dr. Chuck didn't actually explain everything a learner would need to understand what is going on there... While doing the assignment, yes, I admit that I finished all of them, but BASED ON SAMPLE CODES without a full understanding of some non-trivial details. Therefore I am pretty sure without those sample codes I would not be able to finish the assignments."
2016-10-23,Tanja Z,4,0,"I found that some parts of the course were confusing. You really have to take the time to read documentation to do the assignments, which was difficult with my busy schedule. (And just because you read the documentation doesn't mean that you understand the code!) Overall, I learned a lot and still recommend the course - just wish there was less background and more explanation of the actual codes that you can use while parsing."
2015-11-07,Frank M,4,0,"These courses are great introductions to python functionality.  The workload is much more reasonable at 1-2 hours per week than many other Coursera courses that I have taken. 
My only recommendation is to show more current libraries and methods than those presented in the lectures.  Fundamentals are important to understanding concepts, but if there are newer and better ways of doing things, they should be presented as well.  "
2020-01-22,Luis G H C,4,0,"Great course, very interesting, but I find this part of the program should be optional, since not all the people is interested in retrieveing data from the internet; besides, these are controlled practices. In the real world it's a little bit more tricky to obtain information from an API and extracting data from a website. Perhaps, this module should be in a different course of its own. That'd be quite interesting to see."
2020-08-11,Rafael R d L,4,0,"Another great course by Dr. Chuck. This one I think it started in a good way, but in the end it got a little  superficial. It looked like we've got to take those ready codes and just make some modifications - looking at the ""logical"" side, it may  be a good idea, but I missed some ""code from the zero"".
Despite that, I would like to thank Dr. Chuck, the greatest educator I know.

sorry for my bad English :) (or not hahaha)"
2020-05-27,Raushan K,4,0,"Everything looks perfect but when it comes to xml,json and api, you need to explain it really in detail. That's a bunch of codes and you are explaining very less. I need to study it thoroughly with the help of internet. But, thanks to the instructor atleast he has exposed me to the hidden world of web. I can read it on internet after knowing these terms. Atleast now i have feel for these hidden world of web services. "
2018-08-29,Hok S C,4,0,"A few parts are not explained clearly as the Lecture materials were going really deep. However, the assignment was not covered that much. Sometimes I just want to know more about that topic but I don't know how to. I know there's an E-book in py4e.com, but I think it will be better to put some non-compulsory materials in the related weeks. Just a little thought and thanks for making suck a good course."
2016-02-28,Deanne Z,4,0,"It's a very practical course.  The course is in a good pace. The contents are broken into smaller pieces. Thank you Dr. Chunk for making Python+WebData easy and fun to learn.  One little thing I wish was the slides and code could be shown for a longer time, or constantly showing on the screen as the two earlier python course. Currently I had to pause the video couple times to digest the slides or code."
2021-08-22,Jehan F K,4,0,"C​ompared to the rest of the courses, I felt this one was the hardest, that I was somewhat booted into the deep end and had to figure out how to make things work on my own as compared to the others where what to do and what was being taught was very obvious, nonetheless it's still good
I​t would be much better if you could go into greater depth and explain more about using Python to access the web"
2019-12-09,Haoming L,4,0,"Pretty challenging course and it is really a harsh but precious experience to understand the key concepts, what the relationship between different syntaxs and the server is, and deal with the assignments. The only problem is that the gap between this course and the previous course is so large that I was even confused by huge amount of new terms and programs and did not know what to do at first."
2020-03-17,Pradhuman S,4,0,We were provided with codes after week 5 in which we had to make changes. It made the assignment easy. I would have loved the course if the parts of code which were provided in last were explained properly instead of giving just a brief idea. For others who are opting this course i would advice them to search the net for the parts which were not explained in the video for better understanding
2019-02-19,Ana L d M R,4,0,"I love the short lecture videos, as well as the worked exercises one. They are very insightful. I also find it interesting that the professor takes time to explain other concepts like the HTTP protocol, xml, json and APIs. I just got a little frustrated about the amount of times we are just asked to copy and paste some sample code without understanding how it works (e.g. ssl, api keys). "
2016-01-20,Roberto Z,4,0,"This is a simple, practical course that will teach the basics of how to access web resources with python programs.
The goal is not teaching you how to write nice programs, but just enable you to write something working to pull interesting data out of existing data sources like files and web services providing text, XML and JSON data.
The videos also feature some interesting background."
2016-01-11,Miloš T,4,0,"Very good course for beginners. I liked the lectures, they were engaging and bonus videos are nice addition. Exercises were maybe too easy, but still for a beginners course just right. The only problem is there is less practical work than it should be, adding more exercises would be nice, and adding more difficult ones would help better grasp the material. That's why only 4 stars."
2017-06-18,Syed M F J,4,0,"I was looking for a web scrapping kick off in python and come across this one of its own kind course. It is really a very good course not only focusing on practical and applied side but also giving a good start/refresher  of internet technology, making a good good background. Interviews of relevant major break throughers are also on spot. A highly recommended course for starters."
2016-12-05,Julian M,4,0,"This course was very well set up, and easy for a person with a reasonable knowledge of Python basics to understand. 
I would have appreciated a little more in-depth assignments, or perhaps two-stage assignments that delved a little more deeply into JSON and XML use, to expand upon the concepts learned in the first.
Overall a fantastic intro to interacting with web data with Python."
2017-03-09,Shivkumar U,4,0,"An excellent course, Dr. Chuck manages to put various things with ease. Material as well as teaching is excellent. However, I found the necessity of having more programming exercises with more difficulty than what course presently offers. More exercises with higher difficulty are needed to emphasize the material we have learnt. Apart from that, this is an excellent course."
2020-02-18,Philipp D,4,0,"I liked the course, but somewhat less than the first two from this specialization and I was undecided for a while whether to give 3 or 4 stars. I would have appreciated more background on urllib, API, or ssl, at least in the (admittedly free) text book. I also think that the part on the Service Oriented Approach in its current form is too condensed to be really helpful. "
2019-09-13,Xinlun Z,4,0,"This course may be hard for laymen who only know a little about Internet. I will recommend people who has a hard time initially to watch some intro video about Internet on YouTube and then come back. Anyway, if you see this informative course through to the very end, you're gonna have a strong understanding about the regular expression, Internet, HTML, XML JSON and API.
"
2016-01-23,Leonas M,4,0,"Loved it, it was hard, but i completed. Course needs some updates, there are few mistakes that took me longer time to complete tasks. And i liked the videos when it was Dr Chuck and desktop video in same video, it was more easy to keep along.  Now it is harder when you concentrate on the code and then suddenly you lose your concentration when you see Dr. in full screen. 
"
2016-02-07,Abdur R,4,0,"I found it to be a very useful class on important topics in web analytics. The homework assignments are not very difficult and encourage learning instead of grade-seeking. Plus, Dr. Chuck is an engaging instructor!

P.s. I gave it 4 starts because the assignments were a bit too easy at times. My feedback is to include advanced but optional assignments in future sessions."
2019-02-26,Sebastián G P,4,0,"A very good course explaining the fundamentals of data analysis using python. The course is a little dense, and goes a little to fast if you are a beginner, but it will let you explore the most important elements for accessign web data. The teacher is one of the bests that I have seen in Coursera, and the bonus materials are incredible.
The previous courses are a must."
2021-08-06,Joseph D,4,0,"This course was very informative and detailed in explaining how to interact with API enpoints. I would like to have had more exercises to work on, and the lectures seemed to be much higher level than the homework and graded assignments. However, I still feel like I learned a lot and it was a great introduction on how to use python to interact with API's and websites."
2015-12-02,Benjamin W,4,0,"Dr Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end. This doesn't ask too much. It's clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session. This course highlights how easy Python is more than anything and that's a good thing. Good coding language for beginners. Good course for beginners or novices. 
"
2015-11-29,Alan W,4,0,Great course and even though the topic was more interesting then the previous 3 courses (interesting as in fun) I didn't like the new format where Dr. Chuck wasn't in a picture-in-picture frame so that we could always see the slides and him at the same time. Many times the slides would cut out to him and it was very distracting as I'd have to pause and go back. 
2017-01-14,Vijay P R,4,0,"The lectures are well explained. But the programming exercises are too basic . Expected the programming assignments to be more challenging . Good course but each week could be completed by 2-3 hours . And the 6 week course can be completed within 1 week by casual work . But its a good introduction to access web data using python . Recommended for beginners .
"
2016-03-22,David T,4,0,"I did the whole course over about 1 day. I was already familiar with Perl, Regex, HTTP, XML, JASON and web scraping, but totally unfamiliar with Python. Fortunately it did not rely on having done earlier Python programming basic parts too much. Will I do the other parts of Python for everyone? No, I think I would rather work and learn on my own problems."
2020-08-11,Sophia M,4,0,"This course felt a lot harder to understand than the previous Python Data Structures course, probably because there is a lot more specialist vocabulary and terminology relating to the world wide web and data transmission which students are unfamiliar with. The concepts are sort of confusing but the instructor's explanation was relatively helpful."
2020-06-16,Sean H,4,0,"This class helps you write programs that talk to the world. It's a good introduction to how the Internet works and how data is shared and processed.
The instructor is helpful, but I advise taking good notes and taking the time to re-read previous chapters of the textbook to understand the techniques you need to use to complete the assignments."
2020-05-08,Anshul k,4,0,Firstly loads of thanks and regards for making such a wonderful course. The course content and quality is undoubtedly very good but specifically for me i felt i didn't understood  the that last API part that very efficiently as i did the whole course so i request you please update that part i.e. week 6 and have us get it through more clearly.  
2018-08-22,Judy W,4,0,"As with the prerequisite courses, I really appreciated the fact that the video lectures were easy to follow. The worked example videos were also super helpful. I would say I wish there are some terms that were better explained / more in depth. For example, the underlying reasons for importing urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error, etc."
2020-05-08,KRISTOFFER H,4,0,"Very good course. However, some things are a bit confusing. Especially around the use of try/except and error handling which sometimes are in place and sometimes not. And also, it would be great to dive a little more into use of dicts when they are in use. Show the different ways to loop and print out for dicts in the last assignments."
2021-06-19,Sagnik C,4,0,"Good course and for the first time,i used the discussion forum and found them to be helpful as well. I guess i cut one star because this course introduces you to topics i didn't find particularly very great, like regular expression. I get that people can find it useful, it's just not something i would ever use for parsing however."
2020-06-05,Rajesh C,4,0,"  First of all, it's a great honor to be part of this special course. I learned a lot, really. The course assignments are a bit difficult than the previous but, I appreciate the efforts made by the instructor. Thank you once again to be part of this ride of knowledge. I feel more confident in python after getting through this stuff."
2017-02-09,Derek A,4,0,Was well structure until the part about accessing parsed data in JSON; this was a little rough as the example provided in the lecture accessed data like: parsedjsondata['person']['age']. In the actual assignment this does not work and I had to use a work-around by using range(len(dictionary)) which is not covered in this course. 
2016-04-21,Adriano R P,4,0,"Very good material and instructor; just lacked on two things (under my point of view):
1) Development of a simple webapplication to make the communication between webserver and client;
2) Implementation of a socket and actually make the capture of a ""stream"" and translate (maybe opening the packets accordingly with the protocol);"
2020-05-08,Zaheen A S,4,0,"The assignments were pretty challenging and interesting for me.I did not even think at first I could solve the problems. But when I solved it I was very happy . It also boosted my confidence.The teaching stuff was so helpful.With the assistance of discussion forum it would take me more time to solve this course .So,thank you."
2020-06-27,Dean H,4,0,It got a bit tougher in this third course but we were warned at the beginning. Gaps were left in our knowledge that we had to fill in in order to complete the assignments but that OK. The TA's are quick to respond to questions in the forum... you will get a hint but not an answer but that's usually enough to nudge you along. 
2020-06-06,Enrico B,4,0,"A little tougher for me - sometimes I struggled to get from the content of the book, to the solutions of the assignments. I guess it's part of the learning curve - made me want to learn more.
Only criticism is the SSL library which appears in all codes, but is no longer available in 2020 and has caused me numerous headaches."
2020-07-10,Rahul P,4,0,"Awesome content , learned a lot and is etched in the memory for a very long time. One star deducted for i felt the course was rushed in the end while covering the topic of APIs (week 5 & week 6) , i feel it can be part of a separate course in much detailed context. Love Dr. Chuck and his style , became a great fan of his !"
2018-05-18,Akshat A,4,0,"Awesome course, Although the professor had to rush through less significant portions due to the time constraint and also to NOT wander away from the main course, And hence, he even has a separate course entirely in the direction of Networking. AWESOME Professor, and the syllabus and course material are equally brilliant."
2020-07-03,Devashish V,4,0,"good course, would have loved it better if Dr. Chuck would have dived deeper on OAuth and the Authenticate dunction he used. But maybe because I'm a Comp. sciece grad, it would've been easy for me to comprehend and not the people who are just starting out ( beginners: for who, this course is made in the first place)."
2020-08-04,Santiago G B,4,0,"This course is an excellent intro to web data. It's a good start to then get interested in the topic and take more courses about it, so you can fully understand everything. 
It will take some more effort from your part to complete all the assignments, than the two previous courses, and maybe look for more references."
2017-10-17,Stanislau H,4,0,"I expected a lot more about scraping: its caveats and workarounds. The course is good for people, who are new to Python, networking, serialization formats. For a person who is more or less familiar with mentioned topics, the course will be rather boring. Nevertheless, I've learned some new information, thank you!"
2020-01-12,Griffin W,4,0,Overall I enjoyed this course. At times it  seemed like Dr. Chuck  could have slowed the content of the videos to better explain what was happening on a step by step basis. I often felt Chuck wanting to race through the material because it was so 'easy' and maybe forgetting he was instructing a beginners course.
2020-10-01,Srj S,4,0,"This is the this course of the specialization course and compared to the first two this one was a bit fast paced in my opinion. Some topics which are not about Python but are still needed to understand what we actually do with our codes could be explained a little bit more in detail (f.i. protocols, APIs, etc)"
2018-07-18,Yintao L,4,0,"Overall the course is really great. And is really suitable for those green hands who has no previous Web Data knowledge like me. However, the assignment is almost the same with the example which means it's only about copy and paste. But I still learned a lot from this course. Thanks for sharing the knowledge. "
2017-02-01,Ashish K,4,0,I really appreciate all the hard work put by the professor to make this course a great one and i helped me to see and experience a new side of python which i lack before.All mentors were very helpful and would eagerly take other courses of this specialisation.Thank you all.I had a great learning experience.
2016-03-15,Derek P,4,0,"This course felt a little light compared to the other ones in the series, I wish I could have learned more. Beautiful Soup was introduced as a way to do things, but not thoroughly explained as a package. I did appreciate the in-depth explanation of XML and JSON formats. Dr. Chuck is an amazing instructor."
2019-07-20,Kevin K,4,0,Very useful stuff. Glad to get exposure at a high level to both XML and JSON. Would prefer to get introduced to objects a bit earlier - and maybe a bit more brush-up on dictionaries as applied here -- but I am impressed how the examples are structured to help us easily unlock things through self-study.
2019-07-07,Yingtong L,4,0,"It gave me a very brief introduction of accessing web data with Python. A lot of things made sense to me after taking this course. However, probably because it's an entry-level course, a lot of significant details were not properly explained. So I did struggle especially when I was doing the homework."
2021-11-07,Sunny T,4,0,"very good course 
very good teacher, Dr. Chuck
very good presentation.
I like to suggest to Dr.Chuck to include more practical programms in the course.
If I get a chance to talk to Dr.Chuck, I like to present this subject more in detail, so that we can improve further.

2018-08-04,ali s,4,0,The course was great. I feel though that the code walk thrus are not thorough enough; and thats important for someone with no background in coding. Often a new concept/line of code comes in and is not dealt with in sufficient detail that leads you confused and ruining the whole program understanding.
2020-09-23,Dawood k a,4,0,"A very good course as always, but I wished that they explained more details about how that network stuff works.
In addition, the Arabic language is not included in this course and because of that, some topics made me confused and hard to understand.
But, it was a very useful course and I enjoyed it :)"
2020-11-10,Philip S,4,0,"Significantly harder than the previous classes in this series, it was far easier to lookup python documentation online than try to find something in the notes and lectures for this class this time.
Also, python couldn't access the web from my company's security, so this was harder for me personally."
2020-09-07,Khadidja A,4,0,"I really enjoyed this course, the lectures are well structured and cover a wide range of subjects and concepts. I also liked the code examples and assignments for their fun and engaging aspect.
I particularly appreciated Dr. Chuck's teaching style that encourages students to explore and experiment.
"
2018-09-06,Peter B,4,0,"I'm not a new programmer, or new to web programming, but I found the conceptual overview somewhat useful and definitely very engaging. I was more in it to learn the syntax, and learn I did.
I think the assignments on this course were somewhat too easy, even for someone brand new to programming. 
"
2020-09-11,Diego A M,4,0,"I liked the course and the rythm of the videos but I wish there was a bit more info on what the different libraries do in the sample codes. I get that there is reading and coding to do on our own, but towards the end I did feel a bit lost trying to understand why I was using some of the libs.  "
2020-08-25,Rishav R,4,0,"This course have many things missing but if you do a little research you will find many more things to explore. This course is not so good as compare to the rest of 2 i completed but yeah  it will give you a wider sense of programming and introduce you to a real world. 
THank you dr, Chuck,"
2020-05-11,Tungon D,4,0,"  Hello budding Python pros out there, I have completed this course as am writing a review.The course was very interesting, learned many new and useful concepts, you definitely should take this course.Thank you so much Dr.Chuck. I loved the course and the way you made it easy for me.Bye ....  "
2019-12-11,Edward W,4,0,"Challenging at times but ultimately rewarding. The assignments are well thought out, and the right mixture of not having to start from scratch but re-working code examples to suit the purpose of the assignment. This still ensures that you understand what each line of the code is achieving."
2018-04-28,June L,4,0,"It is a little difficult for me, it will be better if the ""a long story"" part can be explained more precisely. I often meet with some problems when I use urllib and change the serviceurl. It takes me a lot of efforts to deal with the problems, but I still not understand this part totally."
2016-02-07,Andreas K,4,0,"I prefer the format of the previous courses, where the video of the professor was in parallel to the notes/presentation and did not alternate between slides and video of the professor. It gives you more time to make your notes, and refer to the notes while the professor is talking."
2015-12-28,Sreehari,4,0,"This is a good course if you are interested in getting to know how to parse html data and xml/json data using python libraries. The techniques you learn can be immediately put to use to do some really cool things with existing APIs like the twitter API, or that of Google and so on."
2019-02-05,Roger M,4,0,"The course is very interesting and educational. However the instructor explains very well the concepts. Besides I appreciate the effort to build a parallel environment to test GMaps API, since the service is not available anymore without registering a payment method (as of 2019).   "
2020-08-19,MD. M H,4,0,this course was awesome. But I think there is a very short discussion on geojson or I couldn't understand properly. And API wasn't shown practically too much so that when I go for the search I could not make a match with lectures. Hope that my review will help the next learners.
2019-10-23,Divya A W,4,0,It becomes really difficult as you go with the course. First two courses were really great and simple to understand but this one was really difficult to grasp. I had to go back and forth the training to complete some of the assignments. But overall good explanation by Dr. Chuck.
2018-04-26,Sunil M,4,0,"A lot of useful topics covered in this course. And presented very well, in easy to understand fashion. I would have loved it to be a bit more detailed, with more examples, variations of what all can be done, more assignments etc - so the student gets a solid grip of the subject."
2020-11-29,SanSri1,4,0,"Quality content, but it was difficult for me, as a beginner who has no experience in web data-how things are working on the internet- I felt that those things could be explained in little more detail, so that one can understand what one is doing. Understand the relevance of it."
2018-07-25,Yui Y,4,0,"This course was a great course, just like the previous two courses. One thing I would say is that I wanted a little bit more practice. With the textbook there are many practices but it would have been better if there were more assignments so that I can make sure I understood."
2021-10-22,Giuseppe P,4,0,"T​he course teaches fundamental & useful skills related to accessing data an files from the web, but it doesn't have much substatial material and there is also a lot of fluff in it, too easy considering that you are supposed to have learned the basics in the previous courses"
2021-04-19,Andres S N,4,0,"As always, Dr. Chuck Severance is a great teacher. I just hoped he had more time to expound on the concepts. For a complete beginner (background in Philosophy) some of the key concepts are still too technical to grasp and could've used further elaboration before proceeding."
2020-05-27,Tarek L,4,0,This course is a nice way for those who are tech averse to get their feet wet into the complex jargon of web. It is a way for those of us mortals to get a peek under the hood of the internet and get a global understanding of the major inner workings of the web applications.
2020-09-02,Nowshin T,4,0,"I am rating it 4 star because while it had been an awesome course, it didn't really dive into the depths of things. All things were basic. But, wow! what a way to learn those basic things!! Had it been possible, I would've rated it 4.5~4.6 (but that's not possible so... :)"
2015-11-16,Bernhard K,4,0,"I thought this one was better than the first (two) part(s). Short, self-paced, to the point. Easy to follow and implement. Highly recommend this one. (All I wanted is actually the JSON part, but I got so much more.)
Quizzes and assignments could be an itch more challenging."
2017-07-17,Brian K,4,0,"learned a lot.  Good course, fast paced.  Was not able  to learn how to access Oauth credentials for Twitter.  Online support for this was not helpful, but it ended up that this was not needed for any exercises.  Still, I wish I was able to learn the Python Oauth process.  "
2020-10-19,Florian T,4,0,"In total the course was nice and I learned a lot.The lectures were quiet challenging, especially the XML chapter. I'd like to have a bit more input for this part and the assignments, as it's more complex than JSON. But as always good explanation, videos and assignments."
2020-07-18,Raj K,4,0,"Being an amateur in programming languages, learning about HTML, XML seemed a big deal to me. Dr Chuck was an excellent teacher in breaking down the concept to the basic and explaining it in the easiest way possible. Learned a lot from the course. Thank you, Professor.   "
2019-04-24,Ruben J,4,0,"This is one of the best courses i ever attended, dr.chuck is very very thorough on the basics, and thats where the strength is. I love this, and recommend to anyone and everyone who wants to know about, python and web-data, JSON, API's and all the interesting stuff. "
2017-02-25,Kat H,4,0,"I felt a big jump in the learning curve once we reached XML and JSON. I could complete the assignments because all I had to do was make small changes to code provided, but I don't feel like I've even close to understood yet! Will keep re-reading the book chapters..."
2017-07-26,Ben T,4,0,"The assignments are too easy in my opinion and don't require some thinking, but just some pure copy/pasting or repeating of already seen examples. I think that's something that could be improved because the content of the class and the lectures are actually great."
2016-05-25,Kumiko K,4,0,"This course has helped me learn the basics of regular expression and how to parse html, xml, and json data with simple exercises. After completing the course, I feel ready to apply what I learned to do more complicated tasks with the associated python libraries."
2017-10-16,Murray B,4,0,Nice course and very clear and concise like the other courses in this series. As a mechanical engineer I'm not sure what use I would ever have to use this type of data processing but I imagine it could be useful for someone more specialised in web applications.
2016-02-07,Varun N,4,0,"I have really liked the course and the way it has been presented. Although the course doesn't go into too much depth, it still gives a solid introduction to web data parsing and the available tools for the same. I strongly recommend this as a beginner's course."
2018-12-14,Cathy C d D C,4,0,This course was really hard for me.  I did not enjoy the semantics of the final assignments.  I found it more troubling than the assignment itself.  Would you please state the assignments in plain English? Sometimes I did not understand what you were asking.  
2017-09-03,Георгий Ф,4,0,"Everything is extremely understandable, sometimes even too much, but the main problem of this is its assignments. I'd like to do more on the material, covered in lectures. For exemple, there is a 30 minutes lecture on Twitter API and no assignment about it.."
2015-12-06,Arun K,4,0,"It was a great course but I felt that the exercises could have been a bit more tough. If the exercises were challenging, then it would be a great way to learn the principle of Read-Search-Ask.

Thanks, Dr.Chuck. Looking forward to Databases with Python course."
2020-03-10,Shafkat K S,4,0,I really liked this course. I have learned so many new things here. But the API access part was a bit rough for me. Because the video was not updated. I guess there could be a simple lecture how google changed their charging and how to access twitter's API. 
2020-09-12,Aryan J,4,0,THE COURSE WAS VERY INFORMATIVE IN IT SELF ALTHOUGH I HAD A BIT OF PROBLEMS DOING MY LAST ASSIGNMENT IT HAS SOME PROBLEMS BUT NOW IT'S DONE SO IT OKAY ANY HOW THE COURSE IS A MUST FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO LEARN SCRAPING OF SITES OR A BIT OF SELF AUTOMATION 
2018-07-11,dhruv g,4,0,"its a decent intro class but I felt It missed out on a couple of things. We used beautiful Soup to parse html, used etree for xml without exploring the overlap between them much. However the course has prepared me with the skills needed to start on my own!"
2020-12-15,giri n,4,0,This is relatively hard compared to part 1 and 2. A word of caution: do follow data structures and python official documentations and web structures by other sites to get a step by step approach/supplement . This is still a good guide for summary though.
2017-07-05,Daelyn B,4,0,"Overall it was quite an informative course, though some parts I was left stranded and had absolutely no idea how to continue with some assignments, hopefully when python 3 rolls out for this specialisation it will make it a bit easier to follow through!"
2020-03-15,Aadit A S,4,0,It was gr8 but i'd really like there was a guide for how to install modules like xml.etree.ElementTree etc. I was stuck cuz my program didn't work since i didn't have the module intalled...There are guides on youtube but  very few are actually helpful.
2020-07-05,Lyon,4,0,"Week 5, the assigment sample coding has API included, which was not discussed at all in Week 5's lecture. The sample coding is very confusing. Please replace the Week 5's assigment coding sample with a more relevant and clear coding sample. Thanks!"
2019-10-29,Regulus R,4,0,"I feel the second assignment on week 6 is too easy, it basically writes the whole thing already. Also the materials in week 6 are kind of too much and too fast. Maybe it is better to slow it down and have a more detailed explanation on everything."
2018-12-01,Anindya B,4,0,This course is good but i think i need to have another course of the same topic to understand and grasp the subject more strongly! Overall experience was nice. i got early replies from the mentors when ever i asked for a doubt in discussion forum.
2017-07-09,Santiago F M,4,0,"So simple to practice and understand.Still, I think this course is valuable for programming in python.
P.D: Is a pity that can't access with honour code for all five courses of specialization, and subtitles of videos were not translated to spanish. "
2017-07-21,Tarak s,4,0,"Thanks Dr. Chuck, but at some point during the course I feel we got a little less knowledge. So, 4 stars this time.
I'd prefer a book to learn more, and that's how it should be.
So, thanks again Sir for putting up such a great coursework.
Thumbs up!"
2020-03-10,Rob C,4,0,Great course. Minus one star because things start to move a little fast and erratically in the last few weeks. If I'm not mistaken some topics on the quiz were never actually discussed in the lecture nor the literature (i.e. REST as an acronym).
2015-11-09,Todd S,4,0,"A good course that gives insight into how data is exchanged over the Internet and how Python can be used to manipulate and use that data. For each chapter, I recommend adding 1 additional programming assignment with a little more complexity.  
g
"
2019-02-06,Lucas A,4,0,"Overall I liked it. Dr Chuck is a very good teacher, and the materials are well structured.
I'm just not giving 5 stars because I think It could offer a wider range of exercises, so that we could practice and consolidate the knowledge provided."
2020-07-23,Ehab Y K A,4,0,"This is great introduction course to networking, i believe this course should be longer and discuss more details of access web data; such theory of url and format. API types in more details. overall it is great introduction course to web data"
2019-12-21,Aravind K,4,0,Please update the google api lecture with regards to its api key because i got scared when i saw the geocode assignment and i was unprepared for the assignment because i couldn't play around with the geocode api as google just requested a key
2021-03-15,Diego D,4,0,"Es un buen curso introductorio, pero hay conceptos que se necesitan clarificar con mayor detenimiento para entender el código al 100%. Quizás dividir el curso en 2 sería más útil para poder tener un mejor entendimiento del uso de cada línea."
2019-02-12,Veronika M,4,0,"It is a definitely helpful course to broaden your horizons. As a person who has never done anything in HTML or JSON before, in this course I‘ve learned some basic syntax. But to make use of this knowledge one should go much deeper into this."
2018-05-07,Haci K,4,0,"Some of the vids are a bit long, I enjoy listening to Charles but I would prefer a ""short"" version and a ""long"" version of the explenations, but he knows what he's talking about and he knows how to pass on the information in a sane manner ;)"
2020-05-05,Saimur A,4,0,"Very helpful course, its getting harder this time and become more challanging but if you give some time to it understand the the basic and ask your question in the discussion forum the  course woulc feel like the previous easier courses."
2019-12-22,Amira R A,4,0,"I was much more confused during the lectures of the last four weeks maybe some of them required seeking more resources but overall even if I struggled with some assignments, I gained A LOT of valuable information. Thank you 
Love Dr Chuck "
2015-11-17,Francesco B,4,0,"The arguments are really interesting and even quite well explained.
In my opinion however it should be focused on less topics in order to gain practical skills: there are too much arguments and none of them seems to be explained in depth."
2020-05-12,Nihaar T,4,0,"The teaching is excellent and the assignments given are awesome. However, sometimes during the lectures it gets a bit too theoretical and hence is difficult to follow. Also, would love to have more number of assignments for each week"
2015-12-29,Pankaj P,4,0,"Very good introductory course to learn how you can code to get data from web using different constructs i.e. web crawling, web services, json api etc. Also introduce reg-ex and other programing construct to process the data from web."
2016-11-08,Martin W,4,0,"
Easy to understand explanations and a very motivated teacher!
Assignments were too easy though, because 95% of the solutions were already given by the example program. It would have been better to code those few lines from scratch."
2020-11-21,Christopher J E,4,0,"I felt that the instruction and content was great as always.  I would have liked to have had more exercises with setting up and writing code to connect to an API.  A ""from start to finish"" problem I think would be very helpful."
2020-08-21,Tashi L,4,0,Dr. Chuck is an excellent instructor. I learned a lot about accessing web datas n I'm very satisfied as a learner at the beginning of this journey to learn more about accessing web data through python programming. It's great. 
2020-05-01,Bilal A,4,0,"I was amazing experience, If you don't even have knowledge of web, no issues you will start learning through this course. Hands on experience with twitter and google map with Oauth authetication. I really enjoyed the journey."
2020-05-07,Hrithik S,4,0,"It was a reakky good course and I've completed the 2 courses that come before this in the specialisation. However, one problem that I found was that assignments were a little too complex in comparison of what we were taught. "
2018-10-18,Phong T V,4,0,The course material is well-structured. I've learnt many new concepts and methods in python. I think there should have more practice assignments on week 5 and 6 because of importance and complexity of lessons in these weeks.
2015-12-07,Seraphim A,4,0,"A very good course, but not as good as the first two in this specialisation.
It could do with a bit of editing and strengthening the last 2 exercises.
Other than this, Dr Chuck is an excellent teacher and great fun to follow.
"
2020-01-11,Shaoqing Z,4,0,"The coding assignment is too simple, as one would just change several lines from the sample code to get the result. Hope the assignment would be more chanllenging so that I can have a deeper understanding of the concepts. "
2017-09-22,李宇阳,4,0,"Thanks a lot but actually there are some things that are just listed and do not have an explanation about why they are like that. Even though, it is a good course for CS Dept. beginners to learn for how to catch web data."
2016-11-28,Oliver W,4,0,"Course was very good, but could have a module on setting up a client server link using sockets and how to send and request data between the 2. A bit more emphasis on how to create JSON and XML files would also be welcome."
2015-12-05,Xiaowen Z,4,0,"A very interesting professor! This is my second course in this specialization, and it is possibly I'll take the SQL one as well. However it is too easy. Students still have to take some time learn the modules themselves."
2018-11-24,Dominik B,4,0,"The whole course is absolutely great, but last assignment in JSON section should be improved. After passing the assignment I feel like I do not understand the point of it. Everything apart from that was great as always!"
2018-01-02,TheGppablo,4,0,Not only interesting but also practical for all those interested in treating the web as a source of structured information. Also helps to understand how modern system that conect different services can be put together.
2020-08-20,Muhammad A B,4,0,It was a great course and learnt many new things which I'm sure will help me in my career. I would've rated this course 5/5 if there was more explanation on certificates and authentication etc. when using online APIs.
2017-01-07,Ali A,4,0,"the course is amazing , there is much knowledge in here !!
Enjoyed every week and every lecture
The instructor is funny and never gets you bored !
the missing star is for the tasks, they need to be a bit more challenging "
2016-11-26,NGOUNGA M N A,4,0,"Great Course! Thanks to all the staff, Stephen Mentor and especially to Dr-Chuck... I had fun and learned much. Could never imagine i could go this far in programming and all that for FREE. I'm very Grateful to y'all"
2018-11-05,Ken T,4,0,"The chaning .py files without notes on the assignments or videos that the .py files have changed is a nuisance.  Change the .py files in the full .zip I downloaded at the start of the ""Python for everybody"" course. "
2020-07-20,SUMUKH J P,4,0,"This is a great introductory course for API's and I learnt a lot, but I wish there were more challenging assignments for better understanding. Tbh, most of the assignments were just tweaking the sample code a bit."
2016-06-03,Alessandro M P,4,0,The exercises are very simple. It would have been great if there was a final project so that the student can see how to use what he/she learnt in a real application. The videos and the teaching are certainly good.
2017-02-23,Arun K,4,0,"This was really a very great experience to have this course. I really had a good time and interest while learning the things. the best part of all these courses are that its very interesting and knowledge feeding
"
2016-02-16,Joaquin M,4,0,"Great kick-off for what I am sure will lead the students to countless hours of solving ""puzzles"" with Python. I wished the assignments would have been a bit more challenging but they definitively fit the purpose."
2020-06-14,Mcvean S,4,0,A great course to teach you the fundamentals of the internet and how to interact with it using Python. It does not go into the depth of the topics and is best suited for beginner and intermediate level learners!
2019-04-05,Jordan L,4,0,Week 6 assignment 2 did not provide proper guidance on how to complete. Had to rely on code instructor gave to complete. Felt this took away from the learning experience on the final assignment for the course...
2022-09-21,Andres F A P,4,0,"T​uve ciertas dificultades para entender algunos temas y ejecutar ciertos ejercicios, sin embargo, me parece una excelente introducion a conceptos y herramientas indispensables para trabajar web data con python"
2020-05-06,AYUSH S,4,0,Great Course! I was completely new to these topics and I found to have really gained something valuable after completing this course. The assignments and the course materials were too good. Enjoyed the course!
2020-04-14,Atul P,4,0,The course is nice and prof. Chuck is really awesome at making things simple to understand. I feel the course could have been made little more rigorous. More assignments of good level can be cherry on the top.
2018-05-01,Bruno M F,4,0,A good intro to xml/json but you´ll need more than this to actually implement both. I´ve been using mostly official python docs to complement this. It´s just too broad of a topic to cover in one single course.
2017-05-30,Xianzhong F,4,0,"This course is really good and useful. I appreciate a lot the efforts of Dr.Chuck made in computer science education. Compared with the previous two courses, this one is a bit more sophisticated to understand."
2015-12-23,Aniekan U,4,0,"I really enjoyed the course and found it cool how you can write python scripts to act like browser.  However the API stuff (especially the twitter one) seemed kind of  vague to me, since I don't have twitter.

"
2021-01-14,penny q,4,0,"this course is too difficult for me as a beginner for Python, but I found it's still possible to complete the course with a little more efforts and more time for trying. but overall, it's fine and I like it."
2020-10-28,Deleted A,4,0,"Dr.Chuck teaches everything from very basics,not just how to code, to access web data,what is the underlying stuff and how it is done in old days and now.The course is awesome for any begginer to start with."
2022-06-15,Aidan T,4,0,"Several assignments were just copy and pasting code mindlessly, and there could have been more clarification on how to implement beautiful soup, but otherwise the course was fine and relatively informative."
2016-03-27,SHIJITH C,4,0,Charles did an excellent job while describing and making a student much interactive in his class. He showed the learning in a very basic way and i personally enjoyed the class. Cheers to the python class :)
2016-09-24,Arpit J,4,0,I found this course difficult than the previous ones and would give a suggestion of adding more weeks if the course syllabus demands.Syllabus of this course is very vast and so lectures must be increased.
2016-04-11,Akhil G,4,0,"Dr. Chuck class is full of learning and fun. He leads us through everything in a logical manner thus even people who do not have a lot of experience with programming, even they find it easy to understand."
2015-12-21,Daan,4,0,"
Great introduction to web scraping, basically teaches you what you need to start doing web scraping on your own. Only remark, why teach urllib instead of requests? requests seems to be the better library."
2018-06-10,abhinav y,4,0,"Very good one for candidates who are new to comp science and programming, helps one gain a lot of abstract understanding about computers, internet and networks.Assignments could have been more engaging"
2017-01-09,CR T,4,0,"it would be 5 star rating if you will provide the deep detail or other practice exercise for Beautiful soup json and rest api
overall great course learn api and i am using Beautiful Soup  now very often"
2020-05-31,MONIKA V,4,0,"Highly recommended to anyone wants to learn the python to access web data, you will definitely learn the content smoothly with the awesome instructor, yeah, great instructor, i love his teaching style"
2019-12-16,Yu W,4,0,"I hope the problem of the final assignment can be fixed as fast as possible. I waste 3 hours looking for the correct answer by using the keyword to find the answer. However, the keyword is not correct"
2019-08-23,Abu T,4,0,interesting course. well structured and paced with practical real-life examples and clear study materials. i strongly recommend this course for anyone considering learning python. Thank you Dr. Chuck!  
2017-03-28,Subin J,4,0,The course is very good. However the course covers only the basics of how to use python to access web data.  It would have been  good to add an assignment to  use REST APIs in the real world scenario.  
2019-04-16,mohamed m f,4,0,"need to write code step by step not to get usable code and explain it that's  not interesting , writing the code from scratch is really exciting so please improve the course to be more enthusiastic ."
2016-11-27,Kyle R,4,0,"Challenging assignments, great teaching. I don't understand half of what these computer nerds are talking about, but I am figuring out how to complete their assignments. I must be learning something."
2016-04-08,madan p,4,0,This course is really very useful.The effort given by Dr.Chuck is very appriciateable and this course is very interesting as well because many great programmer told their history of discovered thing.
2016-01-29,Humberto O,4,0,"Dr. Chuck is so skilled at teaching.  His teaching style and presentations are easy to follow.  The class is not as challenging as other Python courses, but it's a great step to learning Python well."
2022-03-25,URK21CS7046 K M,4,0,"The topics covered in this are very clear but not gone in much depth. If you want to get started this is a perfect course and if you are intermediate you won't get anything new to be learnt here...   
"
2020-08-30,Larry L,4,0,"The course, which is the third course in Python for Everybody, is concise as the previous ones. However, for those who are not familiar with the Internet, the course seems to jump too fast a bit."
2019-08-27,Sourabh D,4,0,"Somewhat lacks details. I guess the topics covered is vast compared to the time frame for the course. Anyway, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr Chuck for the amazing contents."
2018-09-06,Saily T,4,0,"This course is really nice helpful.
Week 6, SOA explanation PPT is really nice .
In week 5 quiz contain detail questions that are not explained ,I didn't find then in book.
overall Course was good."
2016-12-01,Sha L,4,0,"It's a good course, very well organized, useful and with great interviews of pioneers of the Internet. Not very challenging though for someone who has a few years programming experience with C++"
2020-11-09,Alice M,4,0,"Very good, and the material was challenging to learn. It felt like an overall look of XML, HTML, and JSON mixed with Python. I liked it, but some of the codes or instructions may need updating."
2017-09-09,Udbhav J,4,0,"Knowledge of Internet Architecture would be very helpful before beginning this course. Its a decent course but being a complete novice, I found myself lost completely on more than one occasion."
2021-06-10,HAROLD D C R,4,0,"N​o me gusto que para el trabajo del uso del geoapi se debiera usar literalmente el mismo codigo, casi me paso igual con el desarrollo del BeautifulSoup, pero el profe es de lo mejor la verdad"
2020-02-01,Todd M,4,0,"XML got a bit difficult, but its understandable since JSON is becoming so prevalent. Need a better animation for service applications. Current one is boring compared to how Dr. Chuck explains. "
2020-01-01,BHAVIK K,4,0,Very Good course by Dr. chuck. It has encourage me to learn more deeper in the field of web scrapping and data science. Some part was boring but overall course provides great value. Thank you!
2018-02-03,Kunyang X,4,0,"The lecturer is fabulous. However, I think the assignment should be as hard as the actual one in university. In such difficulty, we would fully remember and understand how to use what we know."
2017-06-24,Rohan K,4,0,"The assignments were a bit easy as most of the code is given in the examples. But overall a very nice course, many topics covered, I am definitely more confident about my skills in python now."
2017-06-07,jenniferhu,4,0,It's great materials but the mentor or teaching staff is not helping a lot. They should emphasize on the key point instead of talking indirectly all the time. I'm sorry but this is how I feel.
2022-10-04,John E C R,4,0,"I​'ve learned a lot of new content about hot to apply python for accessing to web data, although some content, specially related with APIs is outdated and doesn't work as shown in the videos."
2020-05-31,PRATIK B,4,0,"Quite difficult compared to the first 2 courses and I had difficulty in understanding these concepts as clearly as the earlier ones. However, Dr.Charles Severence seems to be a great teacher."
2021-03-19,Ioannis R,4,0,Useful and once again very well taught. The coding covered is quite different to what was taught in the previous modules and some expressions are not intuitive additions to prior knowledge.  
2016-01-27,tiafvoonug k x,4,0,"Once more, I really enjoyed the course and the assignments.
the later became sightly harder to get at the end, but with a bit of thinking and testing I got through it.
Keep upo the good work.

2022-01-06,Mojtaba A,4,0," ​I loved the course. The most amazing part of the course was its unique assignments that was special adesigend and unlike the other fellows.
Special T​hanks to  Dr. chuck and Coursera. LOVE"
2016-12-20,Marcel v D,4,0,"
The assignments could be a little bit more challenging, on the other hand, they each address some part of the skills I want to learn. Probably I should hold my breath for the capstone. :-)"
2020-06-18,Susmita S,4,0,This was a little difficult course for a beginner. A little more explanation could be given as to why certain parts of the code were used. Overall it was a good course as an introduction.
2020-05-12,Deepanshu C,4,0,"This course is a lot challenging and complex than the previous courses. I feel that this course needed to be divided into two courses so as to be true to its name, 'Python for Everybody'."
2015-12-30,Gervasi A,4,0,Very good introduction to python and its application to access web data. Dr Severance makes the process fun and easy to access. I would maybe have appreciate more complicated assessments. 
2019-04-01,Gabriele G,4,0,Parsing XML and JSON w/ Python is an extremely useful set of skills to exploit in the IT industry; I would suggest many more exercises on lists and dictionaries though; Totally worth it.
2021-01-10,Patrik K,4,0,"I really enjoyed this course, but assignments were quite easy and it was just about editing some written codes and not writing new one. But I like how Dr. Chuck explains and teaches. :) "
2018-01-24,Fai C,4,0,"The content is a bit difficult for anyone like me who do not have any programming background. The materials are too brief to me. But, overall the course is quite useful yet informative. "
2020-11-16,Xiaojun L,4,0,"At some point, I found this course way more difficult than the first and second course. A bit frustrated or else  I still had lots of fun by learning and solving code with Dr. Chuck!!!"
2020-08-12,Arun K,4,0,Typical coursera course like previous python course which is excellent.....No stress taking this course.... Will get good time for the assignments...And thanks to the tutor Dr.Chuck...
2019-10-02,Theo R,4,0,"In general the course is good, giving a good introduction to the topics covered. I was only slightly disappointed by the JSON part, which I wish could have been covered in more detail."
2015-11-08,Giacomo S,4,0,"Yet another quite good course from Dr. Chuck; it may be a bit too quick on some of the most interesting parts, but all in all still very informative. And entertaining in its own way :)"
2019-07-10,Chris C,4,0,"Requires a lot more digging around for information. That said, I felt it was a lot more useful than the first courses in the specialization ( but then it builds on previous courses )."
2018-05-01,dongr0510,4,0,"It's a little difficult for me since I don't have a lot of background knowledge of Web. I don't know HTML, HTTP, etc.
I hope the course could provide more knowledge about these parts."
2021-03-13,Matteo T,4,0,"I think it only scratches the surface of the subject but it is definitely a great introduction.
I would have appreciated more practical examples, not only the google and twitter APIs"
2020-07-26,Antonio R,4,0,"It's a very good course, though it's a longer and should be splited in two. Assignments are a little more difficult and you need to watch videos attentively to solve some exercises."
2020-08-14,sandeep d,4,0,"Overal nice course but the examples were really hard and instructor have in-depth knowledge  regarding this course for sure
I am glad to  learn this course 
And thank you for this!!!


"
2016-01-17,Peter S,4,0,"Great course, I would highly recommend it to everyone who want to learn more about XML and JSON and how to use it in Python. The exercises and assignments should be tougher though!"
2020-09-27,Mateo m r,4,0,"The fisrt two tasks were hard, i needed a lot the help of forums
I would like know how access to other web pages writed with XML or JSON in adittion to the tasks
Thank you very much"
2020-05-05,Ivan O,4,0,"The content is good, the only issue I seen is that the whole course fits into 1 week if you know the python basics (which is required for this course as stated in the description) "
2017-01-23,Fei X,4,0,"very useful skills and give some specific instructions on accessing to web data. But the examples are a little sample, hope  there will be examples of different difficulty level."
2019-12-28,Inti L,4,0,Thank you for this great course as an introduction to access web data using python. I just would like to have more exercises and dive into more practical real case applications. 
2018-06-07,Vlad P,4,0,"Great course, the only thing missing that I was hoping to see is how to download entire documents (PDF's, etc.) from websites. This would be very valuable for academic research."
2017-08-08,Emeka P O,4,0,"Great course, enjoyed the lectures. classes and assignments were on point. Generally I learned a lot, love the regex method and parsing xml / json was fun. happy I participated. "
2018-02-19,David H,4,0,"I could have used more homework, but the later assignments were sufficiently difficult to ensure I knew and remembered all the things I learned in the early part of the course."
2018-01-20,Benjamin P,4,0,Very good. However i believe the course was quite slow on some easy topics at the beginning of the cursus while we are now going slightly too fast with more complicated issues.
2015-12-16,Ethan S,4,0,"Assignments were too easy, and were really ""fed"" to us. Also, I liked better the setting in the previous course where Dr. Chuck was in his office and we always saw his screen."
2015-12-14,David L,4,0,"Professor and course are great. However, I feel that there weren't enough practice questions to bolster our understanding of the material and the lessons were spread too thin."
2020-07-14,Ashok C,4,0,"Overall content was great, just few problems regarding week 6 quiz. Few questions in the quiz(mostly in week 6) were not from the content that was thought in video lectures."
2020-05-27,Vinod C,4,0,"The Concept explanation should have been more detailed. It would have been better if each of the output steps are shown and explained.

But, definitely a great learning....... "
2020-08-30,Sebastián H Q,4,0,"An excellent course.

The only weakness is associated with some no-explained commands and functions. This could lead to a mechanic development of the end-tasks of each week."
2020-06-21,Mohit J,4,0,there was too much jumping between files and the code for twitter2.py dint work at first because oauth from python dint work so I had to download oauth from the sample code
2017-07-15,Ying T,4,0,Great introduction course to python with internet protocol/API/Scraping knowledge. I'll recommend this course to who is new to python to follow the whole series of courses.
2017-06-22,Roger G,4,0,Verry good introductory course into using python to access web data. Gives good background information. The exercises are quite easy for people with IT or Python knowledge.
2020-04-26,Aymane H,4,0,It was a hard course but the instructor simplified it and with little practise and revising the course i think i can master how to access other web data using differnt api
2019-03-10,John L,4,0,"
Somewhat diffcult maybe it is bacause the web is of nature complicated and you need to figure out many notion to pass the exam with full score. In grneral, a great course."
2015-11-07,Ranish P,4,0,This is an awesome and the 'best' course I've taken in my entire  career .  Thanks a ton to Dr. Charles Severance and University of Michigan for materializing this course.
2016-12-13,Mauricio C G,4,0,Immense gratitude for Dr.Chuck and his team for this great job. This kind of virtual programs can bring knowledge to more population and overcome the educational barrier.
2022-07-01,laura e E M,4,0,Este curso me parecio excelente para introducir el tema de datos webs en python. Pongo 4 estrellas solo porque nunca pude hablar con el profesor y me hacia ilusion hahah
2020-07-12,Ronald W,4,0,"Still very good content but it's getting a bit tough for beginners like me and also I get confused about the relationships among different concepts, like http, xml, json"
2020-04-23,Robert F,4,0,Good course.  A lot of background info that could be cut down but good for context.  XML and JSON videos and assignments were very challenging but great to work through.
2017-10-23,nianlong,4,0,"ompare the first two courses this one is a little bit harder, and not so friendly to a fresher. There are still lots of things need to be learnt about spidering the web."
2020-09-11,vaddemani c s,4,0,this particular course did not reach my expectations. as I did not have a background in computer science lots of the complicated concepts were not thoroughly explained.

2020-04-29,Saurabh T,4,0,I really enjoyed the the assignment. It was challenging and worth doing it. I am sure kind of knowledge which i gain by solving the assignment is worth time spending.
2020-05-05,Joost M,4,0,"really liked the lectures and the assignments. Only negative feedback is around installing beautiful soup, what was not working because of the type of bash terminal."
2019-09-25,Kevin C,4,0,"Great course, however skimmed over some key topics that are pretty fundamental to understanding not just the Python but the context of Python in web data extraction. "
2018-08-30,Lucheng Q,4,0,getting harder and harder but interesting because it gives chance for me to communicate with the actual application in the daily life. Great start accessing the web!
2017-02-08,Michael T,4,0,Very good course showing how to interact with the internet. Assignments could have been a little more taxing but on the whole it gives a flavour of what is possible.

Would be nice if maybe in the future you would add some more advanced excersises ( just to gain more practice)"

But overall really good course and helpfull"
2020-01-09,Vinay S,4,0,I found this course little difficult as most of the syntax deviates from what I've learned. I had to check multiple times before I could finish the course.
2016-02-16,Deleted A,4,0,"
A more challenging course, as to be expected in this stage of the specification. It would be interesting to know how much of the underlying code is working"
2020-06-26,P K K R,4,0,"It has been a great course, learnt about different forms in which data can be transferred and how to access and interpret the data. Overall a great one :) "

2016-02-18,Allen Y,4,0,"The class is good, but the content in the class is not that much.
I think more complex project to solve some interesting tasks in homework will be better."
2020-04-30,Ruslan K,4,0,Information Technology (IT) is a very dynamic sector. That is why current version of the course is outdated. I can strongly recommend update the course.

2020-09-20,Nial K,4,0,Some parts of the course need better explanation. I found installing BeautifulSoup confusing and it could have used better instructions for doing so.
2017-06-29,Haydn P,4,0,Wish the homework went more in-depth instead of simply using most of the skeleton code from the sample code used in the lecture slides pertaining it. 
2020-11-17,Bugra C,4,0,"I think we need more exercises and explanation. Worked examples were not good as previous chapters.
Overall good course thanks to a great instructor."

2021-09-20,Mohammad A,4,0,"Overall it is a great course, but I think the parts about web scraping and APIs could have more explanations since they are complicated concepts. "
2019-05-15,Christoph V,4,0,Please change the second assignement in week 6! The geojson homework is completely broken! Apart from that a nice overview to get into this topic
2020-06-02,"Md. A A R A ,",4,0,This is a bit complex than first two course of Python specialization. Complex codes should be more elaborately explained specially in API parts.
2018-07-10,Valentin Q,4,0,Still very good but some code parts were too fast explained to be correctly learned - I would have needed more steps to understand it better ...
2017-08-31,Iheoma U,4,0,I wish greater detail was used for the api access...for instance twurl install didn't work so wasn't able to test various functionality using it

2019-07-30,Anupama C,4,0," ""http://www.py4e.com/code3/geoxml.py"" is not suitable sample code for assignment ""Extracting data from XML"". It makes thing looked complicated. 
 "
2019-05-30,Filippo A,4,0,"Though it rushes on some of the advanced concepts, making it difficult to master them, it still a great example of what MOOCs should look like."
2016-06-01,daidaista,4,0,"Great course! The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that assignments are too easy. If we can resolve some real problems, that will be better. 
"
2015-12-05,Shigeru M,4,0,This course really teaches me what I wanted to know. Text and sample codes are wonderful. I think it's easier now for me to step up. Thank you.

2019-10-11,Akshaya V,4,0,"XML was too tough. More time should have been spent to explain how to parse data and use it through xml.Otherwise this course was AWESOME!!!
"
2016-02-03,Sagar S,4,0,All these courses really need to be updated to Python 3. There is no advantage in sticking to Python 2 anymore with Python4  on the horizon

Really nice course. Help was available when I needed it, however I think some of the integration of urllib needed to be better elaborated. 
"
2016-02-28,David M,4,0,"Some typos in the assignments, but otherwise very straightforward course with good information. -1 star for not having python 3 ""support."" 
"
2020-12-16,Jan B,4,0,A little bit too easy on assignments and more practical videos on how to login on a website and navigate through it would have been nice.
2020-07-07,Juan D B F,4,0,"Overall is a great introduction for access data, perhaps, it has some empty instructions due to the lack of explanation of some contents."

twitter part was confusing, it required rigorous permissions from twitter online apps, therefore more insight was required."
2020-05-21,PATIL S M,4,0,Excellent instructor. He explains the code and concept very clearly. If the course had more coding exercises it would have been amazing

2020-06-26,anas m r,3,0,"I really enjoyed the first two courses of Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody Specialization -- but not this one. As some other reviewers have already stated I, too, felt increasingly frustrated and somehow left alone during this course. Most of this course's assignments were way too difficult and I had to search the web for hours to find some help to solve them. Or, quite honestly, I had to cheat my way through them, because I just didn't know what to do anymore. There are of course the discussion forums where one can state one's problem - but although the staff and mentors are really quick with replying (thumbs up for that), their tips are often way too general and not helpful at all.



After taking this third course I will definitely not continue with the Specialization, as I originally planned to, simply because in comparison to the first two courses, this third course is way too difficult and frustrating!



Also, in my opinion, Dr Chuck tries to squeeze in far too many different topics and different programming langauges into this course, instead of really just focusing on Python itself.



I completed this course, yes, but it left me with a very frustrated and unsatisfied feeling. I don't think I was really able to learn a lot from it, which is really a pity, since I enjoyed the first two courses so much.



"
2017-10-01,Elham K,3,0,"I'm giving 3 star because I compare this course to Python for everybody and data structure which are perfect courses. The first reason that I'm not happy with this course is that you can never get the course finished because you have to wait for your first assignment reviewed by students and I saw in Forum that some people are waiting for 1 year! I guess thousands of students are waiting to get their homeworks reviewed. The assignment is taking screenshot from your python installed and printing something! This is the third course and who got this far for sure has python installed, Is the assignment really that necessary?!
Another reason is the lectures are in python 2 and for the assignments if you are going to work with python 3 (which by the way they recommend students use it rather than python 2 in the first course), is going to be pain. There are really different and its confusing and frustrating to figure out the codes that work with your python version. 
I also think the lectures somehow got really complicated and difficult very fast in this course. However, I have to be fair and admit that I didn't know anything about xlm, html and json before taking this course and now at least I know what they are!"
2022-06-24,Sunshine a W,3,0,"This module is where the Python for Everybody specialization kind of goes off the rails. It starts off good with RegEx, and probably could have dedicated another week to it, as I found it really interesting. Once it gets into networks and sockets, it's still interesting, but it starts to become less about Python and more about broader, big picture stuff. But there is still a lot of coding involved, and the lectures are very good. 
However, by the end of the module, the assignments become less about coding and more about the big picture things that the code can do. The assignments become more about copy-pasting the already written code and tweaking one or two things about it than actually writing code an learning python. 
The instructor is obviously very knowledgeable and the lectures are easy to follow along with. But by the end of this module the material offered up is just too broad, and there's not a lot to do in the assignments."
2022-02-22,Catalin-Leonida C,3,0,"
I only rated courses in the py4e specialization with 5/5 so far, but I'm gonna be honest, this wasn't good. The average student that takes this specialization is not nearly prepared enough to start using Python for accessing web data as they only wrote several programs containing 30 lines of code each. And this showed when the teacher couldn't even give any interesting and challenging 'home exercises'
, because he knew the topic was covered at a very,very superficial level and the students are complete beginners.

The third course of the specialization should have pushed students into deeper and deeper procedural Python, by building on the first 2 courses until they could make a few small projects by themselves, then go into OOP, make a few object oriented projects, and only then get into web and databases.

As always, see you in the next course."
2020-08-25,Wisdom S,3,0,"The prior courses in this specialization  are  great, however be aware that around week 4 of this course I believe its Assignment 2  using the url to spider links it becomes problematic, and the reason for this is that the outline given to you to solve the problem by the auto-grader is wrong  you will waste hours scratching your head as to why  your not coming up  with the correct sequence.It is only when you  go  to the forum that you will find out what the correct steps are that your code should follow. Along with working with URLs this course introduces google API  Twitter API,XML and json  towards the end. My only nitpick with this is that your given one-two assignments with these concepts  but there is no assignments to explore  and utilize  other data on the web its pretty much up to the individual own initiative    "
2020-08-19,Alexis H,3,0,"This is a great course with a fantastic instructor. However, the teaching staff was extremely condescending and impatient. Apparently she expected all of us to do the assignments in the same way, and if a student used a different method and got stuck, she would just tell them to switch to the one method she suggested and provide no helpful feedback on their questions at all.  For the assignment in week 5, she posted a step-by-step guide and then replied to almost all questions in the discussion board by telling people to reread the guide or even delete everything & start over to just use her method.  As the TA for a beginner's class, she is very discouraging for people who just started learning coding. She definitely made the learning experience a lot worse than it needed to be. "
2020-05-13,Dr R B,3,0,"Thanks for the wonderful course.  I truly had a great opportunity to learn from  a Professor from MIT by sitting in India. The lectures were beautifully presented so that we do not have a feel of how time elapsed. However, compared to the previous 2 courses, this one is a little bit tough to learn.  The explanations and slides changing are too fast that it was very difficult to grasp the concept. The Twitter API example and corresponding videos could be avoided since it requires a lots of stuff from the Professors library.  Overall, the number of videos in Week 6 could be reduced.  Please bring the flow of clarity like in Course 1 and Course 2 in Course 3 also.  If possible, please upload a copy of the PPTs at course website."
2020-05-01,Jorge Z,3,0,"Graders/TAs are not very helpful, and condescending at times, which takes a lot away from the learning experience. This didn't only happen to me, but to others as well. I ran into these incidents while going through the different forum postings looking for answers to my questions. Also, I wish more robust programs would be added to the lectures and have the teacher explain them, so that the students can gain more supervised experience with more complex assignments. Other than that, the professor is a great lecturer, always has a simple way of explaining CS concepts and make his lectures easy to follow. One last thing, please improve on the assignments description - the objective is not always clear. "
2020-05-29,Cornelia C,3,0,"I enjoyed this course, and the learning materials and instructor is great, but I felt that quite a bit that was covered (like the Twitter URL and API) required me to accept a number of principles/code that seemed to be a lot more complex than my beginner level could really engage with. When the assignments came we were given sample code that was 80-90% usable in our assignments. I did not feel like I was learning as much when I did not have to write my own code  but just changed one or two lines...I also did not feel comfortable to attempt my own version as there were so much (given) code that I understood the reasons for but not really how to use it differently myself.  
"
2020-06-09,Arash E,3,0,"The course itself is fine. However, if you want to get the most out of it I recommend to take some courses in web page and network design before taking this course. The assignments are pretty much consist of pre-made programs provided by the instructors and students  adjust them slightly to pull data from the web and then adding few line of codes from two previous courses in the specialization to loop and iterate to calculate some numbers.If the pre-made programs are not provided I don't think that you are able to write the program from scratch by yourself if you don't have beforehand knowledge and understanding web design"
2018-01-23,Michael T,3,0,"  3/5, great professor lectures and good textbook, but the class is structured in such a way as to rush us through every new concept without lingering to practice or revisit material, and the assignments seemed to be very difficult in comparison to the previous classes. This is especially the case after introducing us to BeautifulSoup -- the difficulty of the assignments ramps up very quickly for people with no programming experience. This class has a fun professor and decent reading material but it may take studying elsewhere to complement your grasp of concepts when completing the class's assignments."
2017-11-14,Julio L,3,0,"I liked this course and I am liking the specialization a lot. But I noticed the quality of the courses decreasing. The first courses were perfectly explained and worked and I know what was everything.
In this course there is a lot unsaid, a lot of things in the code that are not explained. And it goes very fast. I understand that at this point the professor might expect us to look at documentation, but he does not explain how that documentation is organized nor where it is. And the documentation is NOT easy reading.
I wish there were some more explanations and more exercises like in the first courses."
2020-04-27,Almudena P S,3,0,"I think that this course, in comparison to the previous ones is considerably more difficult. One has to link all that was learned previously in python to these new exercises and I feel like there is a lot of information given in a short time. Also, the assignments are considerably more difficult than the examples provided during the lectures. I think the course would benefit from some additional assignments as well as either additional lectures or directions to further reading and exercises that would facilitate the understanding of the concepts related to using python for accessing web data. "
2018-06-09,Soren G,3,0,"I continue to like these courses, although I spent way too much time on the assignments. I also think the assignments are poor in terms of teaching. I actually do not know, if my programs were good or not. I just know, I muddled myself through to reach the correct results.The grading of this course was not working properly. I had problems grading my colleagues, and was therefore not getting credit at the time I actually finished it.Coursera has to improve, so such frustrating things do not diminish the actual pleasure and benefit of learning over this platform do not diminish sharply."
2021-06-04,Pun S B L,3,0,"This course was great in terms of learning the most practical things, but was a bit lacking in fully explaining all the code. In real situations, I don't expect to have sample code handed to me and in that case I believe that having keywords and imported formats be explained better, at least when we are looking at the code. I had to consult my mate who is knowledgeable in those fields but otherwise I could do all the bits needed by myself. The beautifulsoup chapter was especially frustrating as the documentation for the format is awful and I'm told it's not very common to begin with.
"
2020-09-20,Boya T,3,0,"After taking previous two courses I think everything is going on well and being organized we. But from this course the difficulty increases extremely. I did not have any problem to do assignments in course 1 and 2, but in this course 3 I have to post questions on the forum because I cannot even understand the assignment question, or search even basic concepts on Google. Maybe the teaching staff want us to do assignments independently and they only answer part of my questions on the forum. But as I have problems in doing assignments, I hope they could give me clear explanations."
2020-07-04,JOSE A R C,3,0,"The codes are too hard. Maybe this course will benefit from being a whole specialization for full comprehension of the libraries used, such as urllib or BeautifulSoup. The XML task was really hard, especially because of the Geographical code. If anyone sees this, before taking this course, I strongly sugest taking other basic python courses, and if you have taken other python courses; I suggest you to do week 5 and inmediatly week 6, to understand the week 5 task. Other than that, the teacher is great, and other tasks are kinda easy. "
2015-12-03,Nemanja P,3,0,"Course had pretty good basic information for people not familiar with programming. I would like to have seen more in-depth tasks or project(s) that would require deeper exercise of the topics covered in class. Each assignment boiled down to parsing a file using specific method (reg ex, Beautiful Soup, XML, or json libraries) to do the same task. Requiring people for instance to build additional data types already taught (lists, dictionaries) would have been at least little more challenging.
Overall it is a good basic intro class. 
"
2019-04-20,Nath S,3,0,"Very difficult, this is not for beginners, should be intermediate.
They should consider make the course a bit longer so they could explain the topics with more patience and details. I, particularly, needed a lot more explanation about JSON and XML before those assignments.
The mentors of the forum could give more details to answer our doubts, after all,  we are beginners! 
Maybe a reminder should be repeated every lesson because it is a trouble in every assignment we make: attention to the Python version we are working!
"
2021-07-02,Angelo F,3,0,"I have enrolled in this course because, I´d like to improve my skills on web scraping, but I am disappointed. For those who already are familiar to Python, this course is too basic and do not teach anything new about web scraping. Some videos are repetitive and the bonuses are worthless.
I would rate it two stars, but I think I should have evaluated it better before enrolling. Considering it might be useful for beginners at Python, I rate it three stars, but it should have better videos, materials and evaluations."
2020-06-22,David B,3,0,"The topic is an important one I feel but this course is way boring. Despite the instructor being a great teacher, I felt he was just reading slides without going on with a more detailed explanation. There is no engagement with the students other than the forums which are awful for providing good answers despite the fact that they answer fast. No in-video questions, the exercises are too ambiguous or too easy. At the end, I just wanted to finish, get my certificate, and continue with other courses than this one."
2020-07-28,Achal J,3,0,"The course is awesome, really awesome but there's one thing, which I didn't really liked, the part of REST API and API what taught at a very fast pace, and the the course should have divulged more into API and how to handle them and use them, I mean there are lots and lot of pubic API's available and we still discuss about paid API's. That really disappointed me.
But still, Dr.Chuck is one of the best educator on Coursera and I would highly recommend this course, but you would need to google a ton of things."
2018-10-04,sankara k,3,0,"I feel that some of the videos here were short and fast. JSON could have been dealt in more detail. It would have been nice to have a piece where you write a program only to dump the JS and then use that dump to show how the individual elements can be retrieved, counted etc. It was not intuitive for me to know that print (""Place id"", js[""results""][0][""place_id""]) would print place_id. I had to dump the JS, look down and see the tree structure and get it. 
Twitter API video especially was too fast and short. "
2019-09-20,Adryan J M,3,0,The biggest frustration I have with this course is that the examples worked through in the class don't exactly correlate with the assignments we are given. I will understand the lectures for the most part but then end up completely lost during the assignments. I know the point of the course is to struggle and work through problems but the retention is difficult. I have had to seek help through outside resources because I don't feel like the course adequately prepares us for the assignments. 
2018-01-02,Susanne E,3,0,"This course progresses in large steps. It probably gives a good overview over the topic, how to access web data, but the commands are very specific and it moves on very quickly to the next section without going into much depth. In that sense it is very different from the first two courses which taught the basics at length. It is still a very useful course. I feel like if I ever have to write a program to access web data I at least know what structures there are and which tools to look for."
2020-02-14,김태림,3,0,"contray to precedent two courses, this course was too difficult and unfamiliar. When I had taken other courses, I've been sure that I fully understand what I learned. However, in this course, access web data is completely different to what I learned at prerequisite lectures. It requires me to use unfamiliar library and functions, but explanation about them was not enough. Thus, even though I finished the lecture and passed all assignment, I'm not sure that I understand what i learned."
2019-08-09,Diego R,3,0,"Most of the times I really didn't get a solution or an answer every time I did a question in the discussion section. Most of the times the teaching staff answer me with another question or a vague answer. I know that the strategy behind that tipes of answers is to encourage the students to thinks by themselves. But in some cases, it seems very excessive. In any physical class, the teacher will be happy and predisposed to answer and give you a solution to your problem. "
2020-08-29,KAREN S G Z,3,0,"The courses 1 and 2 have been excellent. But in this third it seems it pass from a beginner to a super level. The first week was acceptable but after that it's more and more difficult.  The explanations are lacking and I feel I really didn't undernstand the majority of content. Fortunely I finished the course because I'm taking other courses about this issue. I really love the teacher, but I don't know what happened in this course, I don't recommend it."
2019-07-22,Artem M,3,0,"In the previous courses all the assignments could be completed just through making a code with the parts that were explained in the videos, but it's slightly another thing in this one. In the second assignment there were included such things as SSL and one cannot make the task right without adding SSL in the code (SSL weren't among the course topics).
Nevertheless, the API part is the only one which I had troubles with, other ones are great as usual."
2020-08-21,Fabricio A B C,3,0,"El curso es muy básico para aprender Acces Web data, pero para usar python con Acces Web Data siendo principiante con python supongo que esta esta bien, los ejercicios son muy sencillo a excepciona de uno que otro que el programa ejemplo te puede llegar a confundir y entorpecer un poco si dependes mucho de el. Tiene un toque de dejar a un lado la explicacion a profundidad en algunos aspecto  para ser mas practico, pero como dije, en lo elemental.  "
2016-04-17,Tolga S,3,0,"All in all, I liked the class. I would like to learn about this topic and the database access using Python, and I still think this is a very good beginning. I like the enthusiasm of the instructor, but I think he short sells many of the things he is teaching. I would also suggest providing more challenging assignments, for instance, as optional ones. These may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the videos."
2021-03-01,Wenjia Z,3,0,"for real beginners of python whose knowledge mainly comes from the previous two courses in this specialization, this course is not good enough - the content is very different from the basics in the previous two courses and is not well explained. Assignments are not so difficult (if the student reads the codes from examples provided by the instructor), but it can be frustrating not to understand the point of the codes. TA can be more supportive. "
2020-10-18,Abbas J,3,0,"This was one of the weaker courses in the specialization. While urllib has it's uses, requests should have been introduced as well (and the course should have been longer). A more in-depth treatment of BeautifulSoap was also warranted.

More real-world examples, as well as more exercises, quizzes and assignments would have made this course much better.

Dr. Severance remains an outstanding teacher who can and should challenge his students more."
2020-05-06,Warnakulasuriya S A F,3,0,"I would have rated 5 stars but, in my point of view I think this course is just beyond the limits for a beginner. Some facts were quite hard to understand and some codes were too hard to catch upon. Overall, the course I think is not that great for a beginner, as the name of the course'Python For Everybody, everyone should be able to understand the facts.  But, It's always a pleasure getting into a course like this and learn something new."
2020-06-01,Sarah H,3,0,"This was a large jump from courses 1 and 2 in the specialization.  This course is not self-contained and there are really two tracks to get through it.  The first involves tweaking existing code but not necessarily understanding everything (which is actually fine), the second is doing lots of research online (also fine - it's ok if a course facilitates learning rather than teaching everything but not sure it's at an 'everybody' level)."
2020-10-28,Kaminskaya S,3,0,"Comparing to the previous courses of the specialization this one is awful. I'm thinking about to drop it. By now I've completed almost 4 weeks. I liked the first week (it is the best week of the course), second week lessons aren't profound and the others weeks are kind of a mess. I hope last weeks were designed better. Being honest I feel disappointed because I haven't happened to learn as much as I learned from the courses 1 and 2."
2018-01-21,Levin F,3,0,"I have rated the two previous python courses with five stars. What changed now is that I have realized that I didn't have enough practice all along. I really wish they added practices which are not mandatory but still fully supported by the auto-grader. I really don't think this is too much to ask for, considering I am paying  $50 per month. Otherwise: good lessons, challenging practices, and great support from the course forum."
2020-06-15,CJ,3,0,"Although I finished this course, I do not think I can directly apply what I learned to solve real world problems. It seems like I have to watch some more YouTube videos teaching web scrapping. It is surely always good to know the background knowlege behind things, say how web standards are set up, but solving real problems is the gist. I am pessimistic about how this course will help me achieve that after I finish the course."
2020-08-26,David W,3,0,"The web services portion of the Python for Everybody specialization seems out of place; an introduction to an introductory course in web scraping.  It was somewhat informative.  However, I was more interested in developing basic Python programming skills (e.g. writing functions, classes, decorators, etc) to solve problems.  Parsing data from websites did not interest me.  Happy to finish."
2018-04-17,Jeffrey W,3,0,"This course was good but still slightly disappointing. I feel that the teacher should've more thoroughly explained a couple of the topics on the course, including hyperlinks, anchor tags, and how the material in the course connects with the real internet. Additionally, the homework assignments were a little too hard and introduced topics that were not thoroughly covered in the videos."
2021-05-13,Oleksandr P,3,0,"I did have a background of around 3 months of learning Python so I was able to go through the course in 3 days. Comparing to other online course materials very extremely easy and assignments were simply ""change a few lines"" from what you saw in the lecture. For beginners might be a good fit, but wasn't for me. The only reason I stuck with it to get that certificate for my linkedin "
2019-07-14,jose c,3,0,"El contenido del curso es denso, sin embargo el Dr. Chuck nuevamente explica detalladamente que esta sucediendo en el código, como facilitar el trabajo con el uso de librerías que son muy útiles para este tipo de  tareas, el curso en lineas generales es confuso pero no porque haya habido una mala explicación del mismo solo que el contenido del curso lleva tiempo entenderlo. "
2020-05-19,Valen A N,3,0,"It was good as an overview course for someone who already knows a lot about the web. However, a beginner can have difficulties coping up with the course because many topics are simply bombarded on you and they are fairly technical. This is the reason why you should not take this course if you do not see yourself using the information from this course anytime in the future."
2016-06-06,Davide C,3,0,"The course was a bit too shallow for me, the techniques shown are very basic examples of what can be learnt using stock python libraries (json, socket, urllib, ElementTree) or external (BeautifulSoup).
I really expected something more, for instance authentication techniques, or methods to parse complex websites, rather or in addition to the basics shown here."
2020-03-19,John L J,3,0,"The course is solid, and give a great down and dirty, fast paced understanding of the subject matter. My only con is your REALLY need to pay attention to every aspect of the codes otherwise you will miss key information necessary to make the assignments doable instead of hair pulling frustrations.  However once you find that everything falls into place."
2020-07-03,Sushma R ,3,0,"I left some of the concepts were too fast, As the course says it is for beginner he should have went bit slow and stressed some important programs and I didn't understand when he suddenly jumped on topic to topic to fast, whenever he teaches a topic he wants to give two three examples and then go to new, but he was fast and he was in a hurry"
2020-09-15,Jayant  G,3,0,The Assignments were not challenging at all they did not make me think much and also the course material was not in more in detail especially the material for Week 6 where I expected to learn more about REST Architecture but I wasn't much emphasized and also the part where BeautifulSoup was explained could have gone in more detail.
2020-07-13,Jesse O,3,0,"Dr. Chuck is great, and I love his lectures. My only issue is the assignments were very challenging (for me, at least), and there is zero help to guide you. No prompts, no nothing. I find it completely crushes motivation when moving nicely through the course. The final assignment of this course took me all day, using external help."
2021-03-12,Maria S,3,0,This course provides a good overview of how to use Python to access web data. It is less helpful in terms of teaching you the actual coding to do so. So you will learn what is within the realm of the possible. You will likely still need a lot of studying and practicing beyond this course to be able to do it independently yourself.
2016-10-01,Aditya K,3,0,The course did give me the the theoretical and syntactical basics in terms of how web programming is done using python. Chuck Severance is brilliant in his ability to explain complex concepts by reasoning via analogy. It would have helped if the problem sets were more challenging and in tune with real world applications. 
2017-07-01,Aly T,3,0,The quality of the documentation for this course dropped off compared to the first two classes. The problems are complex enough for first time programmers that it can be difficult to follow. Reviewing the discussion forums is barely helpful because the salient details get redacted to the point of being unhelpful.
2017-08-11,Judith T,3,0,"This course had way too many explanatory gaps around encoding and decoding - yes, I understand what they are, but not when to introduce them into the program and not always how to call them - and around parsing XML. I ultimately could not get the library recommended to work at all and used an alternate library."
2019-08-14,Swati C,3,0,"Not as informative as the previous 2 courses in this specialization. The instructor had to skim lightly over a few code chunks, not deep enough of a dive. It's a good introductory course to accessing web data, but left the impression that there's a lot more to be learnt if one wants to specialize in this area."
2021-04-06,Sarthak B,3,0,"The course should have been more in deep with a little bit of more explanation for Chapters related to XML & JSON. Considering that this is a beginner's level course, the course should have been more well constructed, including basics of the API key code, parsing, what OAuth & other functions actually do.
"
2016-04-12,Moniruddin A,3,0,"This course is good for those people who has never program in Python.  But for experience people there is nothing new in this course. 
I would really appreciate if
1)  the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful
2)  what a person would achieve after completion of a course .
"
2020-07-14,Lee P,3,0,"Course could have been excellent if the TA(s) actually helped as opposed to telling you to redo what has already been done. Repeating the same thing over and over again is a crappy teacher. Finding a new way to inspire, encourage and give direction is the hallmark of a teacher (assistant or not)."
2020-07-02,Vinit J,3,0,"  Honestly writting, the explaination by tutor in this course was a little difficult to understand and i will rate 1.5 or maximum 2 on that basis. i refered Youtube for few content . Explaination can be bit more easy to understand. Else the length of course is good and course is interesting though.  "
2017-09-18,Brett K,3,0,"It's not bad -- the lectures are good -- but the programming exercises are quite easy. Often you only need to change one or two lines from some provided example code. Code reuse and not reinventing the wheel is a great idea in the real world, but in a class, things could be made more challenging."
2019-08-30,Ignacio G,3,0,"Interesting. However, a little bit long for the little content. The code doesn't seem very elaborated nor pythonic and as if it were done in a hurry.  The assignments do not ask you to program, but just to do minor changes to the code. Assignments have realistic expected times for completion. "
2020-09-24,Frank E,3,0,"This was the worst U of MI class in the specialization. The videos are outdated or made for Python 2.x not 3.x. The lectures also do not give you all the skills needed to do the  assignments. It would be ok if the assignment was to spend hours researching how to do something, but it was not. "
2021-04-16,Vanessa B,3,0,Much harder than the previous courses in the Python Specialization. People with no prior coding experience will have a very hard time. The concepts are only barely introduced before the assignments force you to make huge mental leaps in order to complete them. Needs more instruction.
2019-05-08,Keshav K,3,0,"the first two courses were really good but this course require some real skills and intrest of programming 
many times i got struck in between and it was tough to find a way out but finally  it took me 15 days to complete the course as compare to first two which took me around a week"
2019-06-26,George A,3,0,"Not as good as the first two courses. The regular expressions section was great but the rest of the sections had assignments that were bad. I'm talking wrong starter code was posted, or just really easy assignments that required changing one line. Don't pay for this course."
2020-05-04,Yash J,3,0,Very Short Explanation on concepts ...I was unable to completely understand and write code on my own especially working with Urls and how to fetch data in my code on my own.So I felt this course little tricky to understand may be from my side or It was too short and fast.
2020-09-29,Jomar J,3,0,"Compared to the earlier courses, I had a lot of difficulty in this one. I had to research for more additional content to understand the lesson. Especially for weeks 5 and 6. The provided material is not self-contained. You have to double the effort to finish this one. "
2017-09-13,Mostafa F,3,0,"I guess for the assignments, it might be easier if the course take a step-by-step approach, so the students start coding very easy programs to access the data on web from scratch, and then the code evolves into something very complex in the final course, the capstone."
2017-12-14,Seth C,3,0,"While the first two courses were very linear and easy to follow, this course seemed out of step and like a mesh of information. On many of the homework problems I didn't feel capable of answering the question. I will need to go through and read more about this stuff. "
2022-03-19,Abdelrhman A,3,0,"i think the content is a bit jumping too fast to be able to understand everysingle work, however the assignments are pretty doable. I'd rather to have more practice step by  step and quizzes to be able to understand well all basics and meanings behind words. :)"
2020-01-19,Mihir A,3,0,A decent course but could be better refined with more lectures explaining the topics in more detail. I really wish I didn't have to go searching for various tidbits of code when doing the assignments but I was forced to due to a lack of content in the lectures. 
2020-08-16,Samyak N,3,0,"I expected a lot, seeing the first two courses in this specialization, but to my disappointment, this course didn't meet my expectations. Topics aren't explained that well, they are thrown randomly. Assignments are about making a small change in example code. "
2020-08-27,CHANDRAMOULI S,3,0,"I feel the course must be dealt with more details. Even though it is trying to just give an insight into the topics, it would have been better if it was discussed further. However, Dr. Chuck always creates that aura to make me listen to his lectures. Thanks"
2019-12-29,Jie L,3,0,"Some of the content is difficult and seems not useful. And also there are some places lacking essential explanations. The quiz of Week 6 is not so related to the lecture. Overall, this course is not so good as the previous one 'Python Data Structures'. "
2016-12-08,Brandon A,3,0,Pretty good intro into accessing web data. Should be updated to use python 3 in my opinion since this is for new python users. Most of the course is useless to me because python 2 and python 3 are very different with beautiful soup and this and that. 
2016-03-31,Katrin K,3,0,"Nice but quite simple. And I missed the teaching of good pythonic programming style (something that is more than just script step by step but encapsulate functionality in functions, use advanced programming techniques, test your code and so on). 
"
2021-06-02,Mits T,3,0,"Access Web Data was very dense and had lots of information.
I needed to access other sources of information to keep with the course. 
The video was too hurried and the written material did not reflect properly all the info in the videos."
2018-11-12,Marc-Michel W,3,0,"From chapter 12 on wards in the textbook, I think that there should be more in depth explanations into the functioning of the specific tools being used to parse html (urllib and beautifulsoup) and those for working with XML and JSON. "
2018-01-18,Thomas F,3,0,"Started off this specialty with two thorough classes. The content has gotten more complex, but the explanations aren't keeping up. Spending much more time on assignments now, having to re-do things over and over is frustrating..."
2021-01-17,Radu F,3,0,"Good teacher, fast presentation of what can be done with Python vs Web, but you don't learn too much. The level is quite hich vs course 1-2. So if you started this specialization from scratch, this one will be quite difficult."
2018-06-11,Martina G,3,0,"I've done the first two courses of this specialization and found them easy and funny, This third part was confusing me and out of my confort zone. I finished the course but I probably need to come back again on this arguments."
2019-06-11,Verena L,3,0,I still love the Professor but the examples given were way beyond my skills (and interest). Too much xml and not enough json. I believe json would have been more useful (for me at least). But he is still the best professor!
2017-01-30,Justine L,3,0,"Another good course in the Python Specialisation!  You'll need to have a thorough grounding in dictionaries and lists for this module, so make sure you're across the concepts and syntax of those data structures :)"
2020-11-11,Huda,3,0,"This course was difficult for me as beginner, found it too complicated and I needed to do some extra research and studying to understand the concept of sockets, urllib and all that web/ network- related material. "
2022-01-14,Alessandro C,3,0,"this course compared to the others is a bit explained in a hurry, the topics are not explained well or in-depth, and the assignments are not completely congruent with what has been explained durign the videos"
2018-12-26,Bingfeng T,3,0,"It's better to introduce algorithms instead if access web data. Algorithms are basics for everyone who is learning programming, but some specific direction like web develop is for people who interested in it. "
2018-09-07,Ian D,3,0,"This part of the course was tough, maybe a bit more guidance in the videos to get the assignments slightly more aligned, as it seemed there was alot of extra stuff in the assignments and they were quite tough"
2016-02-28,Anna B,3,0,"The course sped through the coding portions while spending a lot of time on the theoretical side of how the Internet works. Overall a very helpful overview, but I would have liked to spend more time coding.  "
2020-06-23,Sushanth V M,3,0,"The lectures are truly awesome, but It would be better if they are more informative. Some of the things in code about web-servicing, XML and JSON parsing in python are unexplained at least not deep enough."
2021-08-04,Nikolas D,3,0,"T​he last exercises were a bit confusing. 
There was not clear explanation of what we had to do.
Also please consider not giving out a big chunk of the code beforehand.
I​t makes the exercises pointless."
2020-05-28,Sergey S,3,0,"The XML/JSON part was too steep, for begginer level XML to Dictionary parsing is complex, and we should go more thoroughly for lines of code, not enough info to grasp the concepts for task completion. "
2020-05-17,Joshan B,3,0,The course is explained very well but I feel there should be more examples with solutions to verify. I also felt it went a little faster as compared to the previous two courses in this Specialization.
2018-04-14,Maxim P,3,0,Its hard to capture all this stuff in a few tutorials. Would be better if you give the newbies some more examples in pictures or so on. But all in all still a good and very interesting cheapter/part.
2017-08-17,Deleted A,3,0,Good course. However it would be nice if the hints in the assignments were more clear. Last assignment had an error and it was not clarified in the description so the users had to seek help on forum.
2020-06-02,Jeet H,3,0,"This course was a little difficult to understand than the first 2 courses. I passed the course, but I felt that I haven't got a good grasp of concepts. XML & JSON were really difficult to understand"
2020-06-22,Paul U,3,0,"This course didn't go into as much detail as I would've liked. While it did give a respectable foundation, I'll have to go and study more on this topic to fully grasp the concepts that were taught."
2018-07-21,Luis S,3,0,This is still a great course but I was missing a bit more explanations for the last 2 chapters as I spent a lot of time doing the assignments and had to check many times the forums for the answers.
2020-09-27,Vishal b,3,0,"It Isn't A Brief Course Just A Glance And Some Basic About XML, JSON And API
You Have To Go Through References And Documentation For Better Understanding
Overall A Good Course With Useful Knowledge."
2019-07-28,Aditya A,3,0,"A very difficult course. Dr. Chuck tried to cover a wide range of topics in a single course which made it really difficult. Instead, focus on single thing to a wider extent should have been done."
2019-11-15,Thomas K,3,0,"Teaching was still good, but this content was less relevant to the task at hand. However, now I know more about data handling and communication  ... - which might will come in handy some day?..."
2020-11-07,Rohit B,3,0,A bit too complicated. Too much crammed into one course to really get a clear understanding of things on a more deeper level. Felt like I was running programs with only superficial knowledge.
2021-11-02,Suparat S,3,0,There are many problems that cannot run assignments such as Beatiful Soup 4. Sample codes are too far to be applied for assignments starting from Week 4-6. Many links are not active anymore.
2015-11-27,Fernanda S,3,0,The material covered is more complex than the previous courses yet there is much less explanation given. It's still perfectly doable but one ends up feeling like you are missing something.
2020-06-29,Kevin C,3,0,Siento que hay cosas que no se explicaron del todo bien como SOAP y REST. Al menos me lleve esa sorpresa en el cuestionario. Capaz que no me entere por el idioma. Igual esta bueno chicos!
2022-08-06,Ognjen G,3,0,"Much weaker than its predecesors just cause its somewhat fast and basic about themes that seem very complex. Some code needs deeper explanation, but hey we are here for the whole ride."
2020-06-10,Gbenuola I N O,3,0,"I am a beginner and the course is intended for beginners. Of course, I would ask questions that would seem awkward for experienced programmers; The teaching staff could be more polite."
2020-09-14,ASHUTOSH K S,3,0,"Too much of it at the end was not explained properly. I would have liked more understanding of API's than this. Up to XML, the course was 5/5, but then it kind of went into a summary."
2020-05-28,Iti S,3,0,course is informative .but i think few topics need more time and more precise information . graded assignments should also be increased for better programming.else the course is good.
2020-07-03,Ashish K U,3,0,"This time it was not explained as much as in previous we were, but ya it was difficult but I was made that much understood to do my assignments and quiz to be submitted in time."
2015-11-23,Mikhail V,3,0,"The material is well explained, but there is not much of it... It is very very basic... The tasks, being extremely easy, don't really bring you further in understanding either."
2021-06-02,Robert P,3,0,P​roffessor is excellent. Student teachers (those who respond to our questions) are not helpful at all. Quizzes do not allow you to see the correct answers to your mistakes.
2020-08-19,David A A B,3,0,"It is find, but I think it is completely out of python enviroment.  So in this specific course you dont learn python, because basically they give you all the python code. "
2019-02-17,Amin A,3,0,I needed some help with one assignment (which had completely arcane problem statement). Assistance was nowhere to be found. The teaching assistants are terrible and rude.
2019-07-26,Mohammed T,3,0,"Pretty good. guess the vast topic was shrunk to limited time hence cannot say this was the best class.

However, it gives a basic understanding of API and how it works."
2020-12-19,Ignacio E,3,0,The assignments could be longer in order to cover more of the topics discussed. They mostly required a slight change in the code previously given/studied in the class
2020-05-28,Euhid A,3,0,"The instructor was a little fast, although i enjoyed doing the programs.....this was a very interesting course, as it also taught us some real world applications too"
2019-11-17,Hank B,3,0,This was not the best of the courses I have taken so far.  Several topics were covered pretty superficially and it probably could have been broken into 2 courses.
2019-02-12,Nils W,3,0,The coding parts are sometime just changing one line of a given code. And sometimes you had to solve the problem by yourself. Could be more hands on programming.
2017-04-23,Petri-Mikael A,3,0,"Seemed rushed, concepts not explained fully. videos are too formal, professor not funny and less relaxed than during the first two modules of this specialization"
2020-09-15,Amit S,3,0,It's a kind of intellectual course and i think rather than covering so many concepts few concepts with complete clarity would have been a better way of teaching
2021-06-05,Sarah T,3,0,I felt the last chapter was a little rushed in week 6. I felt like more time should have been spent on how Keys and parms work when calling different URLs
2018-08-01,Rahul S,3,0,it wont tell anything about creating APIs atleast should what extra is required or from where we can learn or give a quick look what it takes to creat one
2017-01-14,Mikhail S,3,0,"It was more difficult then previous course. As for me, it will be better to have more detailed explanation, because I think it was very fluent. Thank you!"
2016-10-30,Kenya,3,0,This is  a nice slow introduction to python web programming for those who have no experience or prior knowledge.  Otherwise it is not at all challenging.
2021-01-21,Snezhana K,3,0,"The course is very shallow, just a brief acquaintance with the matter. Assignments very easy to pass, even with no full understanding of code provided. "
2020-08-22,Himsindhu B,3,0,Multiple page scrapping is not taught also how to store the scrapped data(particularly image data or text data) into csv or xlms file is not shown.
2018-05-26,Jigish P,3,0,I expect harder/rigorous and more number of assignments. 1-2 assignments are not enough to master anything. Other than that it's good intro course.
2020-08-03,Qingyang Z,3,0,"Not as good as precedent ones, kind of difficult to understand for people who really start at zero, maybe it should be more precise and contextual "
2016-10-04,Albert V,3,0,"
It's too easy. I'd have enjoyed more challenching exercises about RESTful APIs, we have not seen any HTTP mehotd a part of GET and that's a shame. "
2020-09-27,Nayana T S,3,0,Thank you Dr.Chuck for the good course but I recommend more explanation for JSON and XML which I faced a little hard to handle and understand.
2019-05-15,Akashguna R T,3,0,"No clear cut , detailed explanation  you would not know 100% how the program works you have to copy and paste some part of program blindly"
2017-08-05,Eszter S,3,0,Excellent course for gaining some basics in accessing web data with python. Sometimes I wish there were more deeper explanations provided. 
2015-11-09,Amit D,3,0,Course is good but the assignment are too basic. I would appreciate if there could be tougher assignments may be not included in rating. 
2020-05-14,Rishabh M,3,0,"sir charles just taught us very basic.Most of which you need to study urself.One thing he made me believe that its just simple and easy
"
2017-08-11,nikhil k,3,0,"wish it had more examples and more things to solve ... although Dr Chuck is awsome , the staff and mentors are prompt in their reply.."
2020-09-18,james d,3,0,A very good overview but just that an overview. I wish it would have been more involved in order to get a more thorough understanding
2020-06-24,Astha K,3,0,It was a good course . Instructor was good enough but i think it was a pretty introductory course on using python to access web data.
2015-12-08,Ivan F,3,0,Wey easy for the person with some python experience but the best part is that takes only hours to complete all assignments and quizes
2021-09-07,Vasileios D S,3,0,"Several modules are introduced but very superficially, because the concepts/protocols to which they relate are not covered in detail"
2020-06-28,AMMISH T,3,0,Wasn't detailed and couldn't follow where it was heading at..Instructor just covers a part of it and it pretty much feels useless ..
2018-01-23,Christopher I,3,0,"As most of Severance's courses on Coursera, there is no real challenge or learning curve, these are simply very light introductions."
2016-12-28,Steve C,3,0,I learned a few new things on this course. It's not so much about the Python language as about the things you can do with it on-line
2020-05-25,SNEHIL S K,3,0,"Meaning of a lot of things was not explained properly and more of mugging up stuff was taught but in overall i enjoyed the course,"
2018-05-06,Shivam P,3,0,I feel the course was introduced much earlier than was needed. We could have learnt much simpler stuffs such as Numpy and Tkinter.
2016-10-20,Ali M,3,0,its a good course .However i found it difficult since it requires you to understand how the internet and internet application work 
2020-07-04,PRASHANT K,3,0,This course could have been more detailed and less paced. Students are not given enough time and practice to grasp new concepts. 
2018-03-17,César D E B,3,0,The background knowledge for some of the assignments was not properly covered in the lectures. Had to rely heavily on the forum.
2017-10-31,谌禹翰,3,0,"too thorough in the last 2 courses, hope more detail taught. 
Thanks Dr.chuck for providing this course, he deserves Gryffindor ！"
2020-07-09,mariana r,3,0,"The worked examples need more explanation. The first example of google API is not even updated because it doesn't work anymore, "
2016-04-25,Brian Q,3,0,"  Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.  "
2020-08-19,Banke O,3,0,I didn't like thie explanations given with this one. I simply copied and edited the code syntax to get through the assignments
2019-08-24,Parth S,3,0,"too many lectures in single week , very difficult to freshly learn so many things at once and apply them in the assignments.
"
2019-12-21,马镓浚,3,0,I think maybe Professor Charles wants to squish too many things into this course and it really make it not easy to follow. 
2020-03-05,sahil k,3,0,"It's been difficult for those who are not from a computer background. More basic lectures should be added for json,xlm"
2019-03-03,Walid  A,3,0,"It's a good course with good instructor , but the part of web service and API need more clarification for beginners . "
2021-01-10,Sofía I Q R,3,0,I think these skills are very useful however they weren't explained very well. The first courses were waaaay better
2020-05-11,Rinkesh V,3,0, in this part we are not taught deep information about web accessing model so this part is a kind of tough and messy
2019-06-05,Josh J,3,0,Some of the assignments are a far stretch from what is in the chapter.  the content is fine and fun to go through. 
2021-11-12,Sid S,3,0,you have to explain all the lengthy code in a proper way so we can understand what's going on in between the url
2020-04-30,Lai J,3,0,"instructions and teaching were all over the place, key details were missed out and i have to do assignment on it "
2021-03-28,BINELLO M,3,0,"Quite interesting, but I must confess that, after the first two courses, this one did not make me so enthusiast"
2016-01-11,Olivier N,3,0,"Good course, but I might have used a little more rigor and material, maybe more exercises would have been nice."
2020-04-19,Soham P,3,0,"Too much content squeezed in. Covered up material too fast. For beginners in networking, it is very difficult."
2016-01-12,Harry V,3,0,"More material, or coverage of the existing material with more library coverage would have improved the course."
2019-08-12,Cracker Z,3,0,Overall good. Sometimes feel information is not very sufficient and does not explain clearly in some details
2020-07-01,Dikshant V,3,0,was fun in the beginening but i had problems compiling my programs as json library didnt worked in my IDLE
2020-05-30,manchala v k,3,0,i think this course is too high after completing the data structures.....it completely blown off my mind.
2020-10-25,Andres V S,3,0,"Teacher isn't good at explaining, had to look for better examples elsewhere to complete the exercises."
2020-05-03,Ganesh V,3,0,"I just byhearted this course.
I didn't fully understand which part in the code executes which function.
"
2018-10-30,Yifeng L,3,0,It's not as difficult as I expected. The course is good for beginners but I think it could go deeper.
2018-01-28,Varun T,3,0,sockets and regular expressions were not explained very well. Detailed explanations would have helped
2018-05-17,Federico C,3,0,Still very good! But probably due to the wide subject the concepts are not explained clearly enough.
2018-03-13,Paula B,3,0,"This was harder than the past two, lost my rhythm a bit too and I don't feel as confident with this."
2018-01-05,patel k d,3,0,my knowledge about the internet things is little poor thats why my gric will be lose in this portion
2017-10-10,Konstantin K,3,0,A lot about offtopic. Lack of details about python related stuff within socket and web parsing stuff
2016-09-08,Asena U,3,0,Not clear examples in the videos. Tests are way different than what the Prof. covers in the videos.
2019-02-20,Rajat O,3,0,"URLs provided sometimes doesn't show results in urllib.request. Else, things were fine and clear."
2017-10-14,Evan M,3,0,"Was unnecessarily complex in week 4, 5, 6 trying to gather web based data for the assignments"
2020-09-19,Javier C,3,0,It was not so interesting/useful as the other Python courses included in the Specialization
2020-10-04,Manjunath J,3,0,good course but it was like skimming over the ocean. Wanted a little bit deep information.
2017-08-24,Edward A,3,0,"the theme of this course is complex and need knowledge in HTTP and Internet architecture.

2020-05-10,Ajoy K D,3,0,the content was complicated bt the slides problem or slide content was not that detailed

2020-09-01,Mark N,3,0,"delivery of information is very poor, yet all the respect and appreciation for Dr.Chuck"
2021-01-10,Guillermo A N G,3,0,"The part 1 and 2 is far superior. It is not bad, but it is a lot that was inconcluded."
2020-04-27,Nazia H,3,0,The course would be more useful if the content of the videos was explained thoroughly.
2021-03-05,LAKSHMI N,3,0,Comparitively I found this course difficult than other courses in the specialization. 
2020-05-16,Peter A G,3,0,Too difficult for beginners or people with minimum programming knowledge like myself.
2021-04-15,Akshita B,3,0,"The course was fun, but the assignments were much tougher than the course material."
2020-12-18,Jon M,3,0,Poos support for xml and json assignments - needed more in depth examples in videos
2020-08-04,SIDDHARTH P,3,0,Great experience. Little bit difficult to understand. Requires more focus and time.
2020-05-03,Nabeel H,3,0,Digs deep into web architectures and web scraping but perhaps a bit too fast-paced.

2016-01-12,Yuri K,3,0,"The course is helpful.
But there are not many practice exercises. 
It's quite easy."

2017-06-13,Tom K,2,0,"I adored all the previous courses but I think there is some guidance lacking in this course with made me complete it with quite some frustration.  The manual does not nearly explain enough as it gets more complicated. There should really be some more guidance as how to maneuver through all the lists and dictionaries . Also a lot of example code is just there without anyone telling you why, which makes it hard to understand what is actually going on.



It might also be nice to get some extra help or at least some tips when you are using python 3. The manual is adapted for Python 3 but the course is not at all, which means you have to convert all example code which is time consuming and error prone.



Then as a last thing, it is really annoying that I cannot do the quizzes and exercises without watching the movies. Especially those stupid questions as who invented this and this. Sorry but that is really not what I want to spend my time on."
2016-03-14,Ricky,2,0,"The continuity and smoothness of the first two Python courses have been lost. From week 3 onward the assignments were badly worded, and that distracts the learning. People were trying to decipher the wording of the questions, not learning how to code. Lectures of later weeks were ""rushed"", very little buildup of understanding and I felt assignments were done for the sake of passing, very little were learned during those final 3 to 4 weeks. Effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained. May be there are topics that needed to be introduced for Course 4, will see, as I'll be doing straight after. The course overall is still very positive and the prof. clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated.
"
2020-03-03,Efron C,2,0,"I wish there were options to hide the clues given for the coding assignments and for the last assignment I understood what was happening and why but I really just copied and pasted the code given for the Google API assignment and only had to make the minor change to find the textual identifier in JSON. I think there should be more than one solution explained for each coding example  and I am concerned about not knowing how to deal with unstructured data, up to this point it has been ideal, relatively easy, structured data in the assignments.  I am learning just not sure how much I can do without looking at my notes as a reminder. "
2021-04-08,Nicolas I C A,2,0,"A pesar de que aprendí mucho en este curso, siento que faltó mucho por cubrir en algunos temas. Hubo muchas líneas de código que no se explicaron porque se usaban (me imagino que era complejo de explicar) y esto provocaba que muchas veces no sabía cuando usar esas líneas ni para que me servían, simplemente copiaba y pegaba lo que el instructor me decía.
Mi comprensión en este curso fue sumamente inferior a los 2 cursos anteriores de esta especialidad.
En el ultimo quizz preguntan por ""REST"" el cual al parecer fue eliminado del contenido enseñado pero no se han eliminado las preguntas en el quizz."
2017-07-13,Michael T,2,0,"I thought that in multiple situations they tried to get around teaching something that they considered beyond the scope of the class and it didn't work very well. For example, one chapter required that you set up a non-standard library. Instead of actually teaching students how to set up non-standard libraries, they just gave you a file that would make everything in the chapter work. This is fine for a class, but in the real world there aren't people handing out magical files that make everything work. "
2020-10-18,Mohamad F B R,2,0,"Dr Chuck is an amazing tutor. While I've enjoyed the content and pacing for the past 2 courses, it is indeed frustrating to complete this course for a couple of reasons. The coding assignments covers content which are not taught in the courses, despite just having to tweak a few lines of codes. As a beginner to Python, despite completing the course, I felt that there are large gaps in this course that needs to be addressed. "
2019-06-15,Fahad F,2,0,"As a beginner, the first two courses had really helped me in getting a solid understanding, but in this course I was somehow left with feeling as if I did not grasp the full content of the course. I think there was too much material to cover and less support to really achieve it. 

Nevertheless, Dr. Chuck's way of teaching is awesome, wish he could have given more lectures in this course."
2020-06-29,Supratik C,2,0,"I felt like the code involved a lot of boilerplates which were not explained properly, and I experience some of the concepts to go over my head.
this course was unlike the previous 2 courses by Dr. Chuck.
Dr. Chuck is amazing and engaging instructor but for this particular course I felt a little more time should have been spent on some of the topics"
2022-02-28,Chasen G,2,0,For somone who has been writting code for 7 months for me its way to hard and not inuitive enough.  I like baby steps and some of the things we are expected to write I would have had zero clude about.   I found myself Googling a lot and even though that sounds great I was really just looking at other code and using parts of it to make it work. 
2015-11-24,Andrea V B,2,0,"Professor is good and funny, and subject is interesting, but that's all. Very basic course, very easy to follow and not at all challenging. Also (maybe because being that easy), peer review is compromised by people who doesn't really know what they're doing there, with comments that were clearly made without any knowledge about the subject."
2019-09-25,Daniel T,2,0,"I felt that more practical examples were needed. I struggled getting the exercises done. Even when I completed them it didn't feel like I knew what I was doing - more like ""ok it is working now, don't touch it"" feeling is what I felt. I understand one might say, the canned reply of ""that is how programming is"" but this one felt different."
2019-11-27,Nigel P,2,0,"I'm abandoning this course because if it's reliance on urllib.  This library isn't supported my environment (Anaconda) and the alternative, urllib3, is too different.  I've attempted to work around this limitation with 'requests' but this only got me so far.
IMHO this course should be re-written using the more modern requests module."
2021-06-08,Amit G,2,0,"3 years back this might be a good course but there is a lot that needs to be updated. There has to be less beating around the bush, off point stories and more to the point facts. The assignments are so easy that you just tweak a line or 2 in the given code and it's done. The final assignment was like adding 1 print statement only."
2020-05-30,Akshay D,2,0,"The professor didn't take enough examples and it was quite difficult to understand the concepts.

2022-03-04,Mihai-Viorel L,1,0,"I could not wait to finish this course of the specialization to write my review.
Even though the first two courses in the specialization were pretty straightforward, this one has terrorised me. Now, I understand the difficulty some people might have met in the previous two courses and left mixed reviews.
I do not even know where to start with how bad this course was. There has been incomplete information in the online course that you could find in the textbook. But, some written scripts/programs in the textbook are different/changed from the ones in the video. Moreover, the assignments' descriptions are so hard to understand that when we had to use BeautifulSoup to follow links it took me 1 hour to understand what I was asked to do. I am not a native English speaker and I could have worded it better.
Then there are other issues such as:
- explanations of installing BeatifulSoup, and where, unclear
- accessing Google API does not work anymore; how am I supposed to follow along with the example given for how to work with APIs?
- Twitter has changed the way you can access their API and now requires  3 tokens, not 4 as in the videos/textbook; I guess I have to look this one up on the internet too, so I can properly grasp the concept
-  there is missing information in the course/textbook on how to approach the assignments.
I do not mind doing research on my own, but how am I supposed to know what to look for if I am not told what I need to finish the assignments? The other issue, and the reason I signed up to Coursera, is that infomation you find online is overwhelming and it seems no one wants to make programming easy for someone that has no clue how to start. I would expect this not to be an issue when using Coursera. And the structure, ""written script"" and explained before the actual script being written down is so bad that can confuse people so badly."
2020-12-26,LIM C C,1,0,"This part (Using Python to Access Web Data) is not easy at all compared to the previous courses in terms of the topics and contents touch on for beginner level, particularly the assignments. There are several portions in this course need to be improved, 1. Lack of full guidance for the coding and workings (the assignments cannot be done solely based on the lectures, external study and research is a must - It defeats the purpose taking up this course, why not choose other vendors with better structured design and contents?) 2. Leading to confusion for the learner in assignment questions (No clear explanation for the expected outcome and poor design of assignment structure - e.g. Question, Expectation, Samples, Steps by steps guidance) 3. Gap of understanding (The details of coding and structures are not well explained from a beginner's perspective and there are some missing part in between the lectures and hands-on! It appears to be in a rush to complete everything in video lecture for the main topics instead of further explaining in details on the theories and hands-on and what come out in the assignment were not taught in the lectures). I couldn't do much but had to conduct research by myself from external sources/tips/guidance to complete this part. Is it really a good choice for beginners to pick up a new skillset in the world of advanced technology? It reminds me that the course name  - PY4E (Python for Everyone). SERIOUSLY, I doubt it! "
