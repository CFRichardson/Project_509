2019-04-02,Ankur G,4.0,28.0,"This is nicely put course but is an extremely introductory and elementary introduction to the idea of current AI wave. It does not lead to concrete learning that you can take back to work. It should have been offered absolutely free of cost including the certificate track given Andrew Ng's reputation and thus the demand for the course.
"
2019-08-21,Eliot A J,5.0,27.0,Everyone should take this course small step for a big picture. Andrew Ng is awesome when explaining things. Quality and background is good compared to other videos. Became fan of Coursera after this. 
2019-03-05,Raghvendra K,3.0,25.0,"I found this course to be helpful. But this is very basic. A direction on how to pursue the understanding further would have helped. Also, the fee for the content and was not that worth. "
2019-05-15,Sreenivasarao K,5.0,21.0,"This course is very informative and explained clearly with examples. I thoroughly enjoyed learning all the details related to AI.

2020-07-17 00:00:00,Ryan P,5.0,13.0,Good High-level intro for AI which is useful for not only those unfamiliar with AI and how it works but also useful for engineers to see how AI relates to the business & when it makes sense to use AI.
2019-08-31 00:00:00,Srihari M,5.0,13.0,This course helped me understand the AI from the basics. The procedures are explained very clearly to make them understand in a layman sense. I would apply the learnings at my work. Thank you!
2021-05-23 00:00:00,AKANNI D E,5.0,11.0,"I used to have an abstract idea of what AI is. Most times, all I can think of are robots when it comes to AI. The course is an eye opener for anyone who wants to understand AI in the simplest of ways.

"
2019-05-26 00:00:00,Muhammad A,5.0,11.0,Excellent course for anyone who wants to understand ai and how it is being applied across many industries. Five star for ANDREW NG and COURSERA.
2019-07-20 00:00:00,Carlos H V F,5.0,11.0,"  It is a fantastic course, although introductory. It is just the beginning and this course simply motivates me to continue my studies on AI.  "
2019-03-05 00:00:00,Édouard R,3.0,11.0,"I feel the content is too light on actual advice and too generic. I understand it was meant as a non-technical course, but only 4 weeks of content that can mostly be found in previous speeches made by the author does not represent enough value for the price, especially compared to previous courses made by the same author.

What is there is good, there is just not enough."
2020-04-10 00:00:00,Konstantinos T,5.0,7.0,"The course actually does what its title promises: Introduces everyone to AI. Well designed, with helpful examples, this course is the best boost for a beginner entering the world of AI. Andrew Ng has an amazing way to transform complexity into simple, understandable words. I definitely recommend it as one of the most valuable courses I have attended so far. Thank you Andrew!"
2019-08-27 00:00:00,Jean-Philippe B,1.0,7.0,"Very general, as a large chunck of it could apply with little change to other topics, such as IT in general, management of change etc.
in the end, you know quite little, just a thin, very thin layer of knowledge, not even enough for friends discussion.
To pay 45$ fo this is realovercharge, for 4 weeks with quite little substance each week."
2019-06-12 00:00:00,Jelle F H,1.0,7.0,too much opinion rather than statement supported by facts
2019-03-22 00:00:00,Sophie C,1.0,7.0,"Too low level information
"
2019-03-28 00:00:00,Bob C,5.0,5.0,"Great overview of AI, from what it can currently do, to how it does what it does, how to ""train"" AI, how to consider using it in you work and the societal and employment implications of AI. One of the major reasons I took this course was because it was presented by Andrew Ng, a foremost expert in AI technology.  The course was broken down well into ""bite-size"" chunks and ""easy to digest."" I would recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand this technology."
2020-05-20 00:00:00,Bhaskara R G,5.0,5.0,Andrew explained the basics of AI very well with live examples and its implications to our lives. He also included technical videos to curious minds. What I liked most is finding the overlap area of AI and your professional vertical skills and working on them. His explanation of how bias can impact AI programs and what are the things we can do to reduce bias is awesome.  This course motivated me to go the whole nine yards in deep learning.  Keep learning life long.
2019-07-09 00:00:00,Binay S,1.0,5.0,"Not that much of good .
"
2020-07-26 00:00:00,Nitin S,1.0,4.0,Waste of money hardly talks anything meaningful about AI. Better read few articles on AI then wasting money on this course 
2020-07-09 00:00:00,giri b,1.0,4.0,Nice 
2020-02-01 00:00:00,Vivek N,5.0,3.0,"Just the Right Kickoff and Momentum as Andrew Ng says as first step !!!!!!
The way he delivers the material is just tooo goood.
I completed the course i think more fun way .
This is first in line for my AI journey and will follow the tips as mentioned by Andrew to see how AI can be used in our current processes .

2020-07-13 00:00:00,Khandaker M A,5.0,3.0,"This course, by far, is the most interesting introductory AI course I have ever done. It really shows the way to accelerate job skills on AI companies. For those who want to have a new AI startup, this course is a must. So don't waste your time, enroll as early as possible."
2020-12-31 00:00:00,Umer K E ,5.0,3.0,"I am so satisfied that I chose this course to begin my learning of AI. Highly recommended for the starters, The way of explanation, use of easily relatable examples and fruitful advices in the last week of this course are the things which I loved most about this course."
2021-05-23 00:00:00,Rahul V K,5.0,3.0,"
Great Course to start with !I am so glad to start off my AI journey 
with this course. It helps to get a comprehensive overview of what AI is
 and its impact in the society. Thanks Andrew NG, Coursera and 
DeepLearning.AI for providing such a wonderful course.

2020-07-14 00:00:00,Sagar d,5.0,3.0,Great course - both thoughtful and concisely focused on the essential and complex environment around AI alongwith an introduction to the present stae and projected state
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Yashuv B,5.0,3.0,This course is the best if someone want to know concepts behind AI(new elctricity). It would be helpful if this course is taken before getting into AI more.
2020-05-29 00:00:00,Mariyada K ,1.0,3.0,I did not find much information 
2019-11-21 00:00:00,sobia p,5.0,2.0,"I found this course very informative, specifically for the one like me, who is starting this AI from scratch. Andrew Ng provided a complete picture of how AI can be practically implemented for the betterment of society. I would like to suggest if some practical videos of AI applications could be added like how Alexa, siri are being used. As being a national of developing country Pakistan where technology is not very common. These devices are very expensive and are not frequently used, so a exposure is required. And another suggestion concept in case studies in which step expertise of software engineer, Machine learning engineer are required need to be emphasized. What kind of hardware support is required need to be discussed for the development of application Otherwise it was perfect. Thanks Andrerw Ng.

2021-03-22 00:00:00,Danielle D C,5.0,2.0,"This course did an outstanding job of conveying and demystifying what AI is, its limitations, and where we are at in terms of advancement in Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) vs. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It was particularly helpful in defining common terms & the processes involved, that you would hear being used in various discussions, webinars, etc surrounding Data Science & AI. These include Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Technical & Business Diligence. Overall, Professor Andrew has done an impeccable job of explaining these concepts in a simplified way, which will actually stick with you for the long term. Thanks again Professor Andrew! "
2019-09-12 00:00:00,Jungyong U,5.0,2.0,"There has been loads of hype about AI from the media. For those who have not learned Artificial Intelligence, that is quite confusing on whether this technology at the moment might be feasible. However, I have now realized how AI works and where it might be needed to make the world a better place. Thank you so much, Prof. Andrew Ng. "
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Zhangrui W,5.0,2.0,Great course for beginners who are curious about AI. It gave me a general understanding of AI. The lecturer can clearly explain concepts and theories. 
2019-07-21 00:00:00,Rory W,5.0,2.0,A great course pitched at the right level ensuring inclusive to anyone wanting to learn and benefit from this topic.
2019-07-20 00:00:00,Vishwanath N,5.0,2.0,Just Excellent! A must do for professionals and students who are interested in Technology.
2019-07-21 00:00:00,VAIBHAV G,5.0,2.0,"Great course to get an overview about What is AI, its future aspects and much more!"
2020-04-06 00:00:00,Zulkafil A,5.0,2.0,A brilliant course for introducing AI to the masses. AI for everyone indeed.
2019-12-23 00:00:00,T T,5.0,2.0,I'd recommend anyone who wants to have AI in your career take this course.
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Ahmet S K,5.0,2.0,Thanks for the amazing education.
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Kardam R J,5.0,2.0,very good introduction of AI... 
2019-07-21 00:00:00,Lu C,5.0,2.0,Very good basic introduction.
2021-01-06 00:00:00,Benjamin I,4.0,2.0,"I chose ""AI for Everyone"" because more than half a million people took this course. I am a geographer and public policy analyst with limited data science knowledge and I found this a useful beginner's course for people who are non-experts.  It mostly covers the basic AI terminology in the first week, then it shifts to AI project management and how to introduce AI to your organisation/business in week 2 and 3, and in the last week it briefly talks about societal issues with AI such as bias and discrimination. I would have appreciated if the first week was a bit more technical. Instead of just mentioning the terms as an overview, they should have spent a bit more time explaining AI methods like machine learning, training and test data, deep learning, neural networks... Also, it would have been cool in the concluding session of week 4 to outline what should be the ""next steps"" for people who want to get more into AI. What programming languages and tools  are a must for beginner level learners of AI, etc...all in all it was a decent course. I would still recommend it to anyone who is interested in AI but has no idea where to start from. But if you want more than a basic overview, you will need to sit through another course that is probably longer and more in-depth. BTW, it takes approx 1.5h to complete one week of materials in this course. So it was like watching 4 movies. Goes faster if you increase the speed of the videos. "
2021-05-13 00:00:00,Marcelo M C,4.0,2.0,"Very well structured. Clear explanations. Not only a great introduction to AI to anyone, but also a good foundation to have a complete overview from the point of view of executives and managers, including organizational impacts and an AI framework based on experience to move forward in any organization.  Andrew conveys a powerful message and is very balanced in terms of what can be done or not with AI and its impacts. Thanks Andrew and deeplearning.ai for such a great content.
I just found the course to be shorter than I would have expected, even for an introduction. I finished rather quickly. It is planned for a 4 week duration, but probably in a week or two, you can achieve it.   "
2020-07-07 00:00:00,Akshat B,4.0,2.0,"After I did this course, I'd say I skimmed over a book explaining what AI is, what it does, how it can be used, what had been done, what can be done, what should not be done. I say skimming because it should discuss a little more in technicality and not completely in layman terms. nonetheless, I learned things I didn't know and I am happy about it."
2020-07-14 00:00:00,Sean O,4.0,2.0,Good overview of AI.
2020-11-03 00:00:00,Heather L B,3.0,2.0,"This is my first time taking a course dedicated to explaining the machinations of Artificial Intelligence. It was great to see some visual examples of AI and how it accumulates user data and other forms of information, but the course is very information-dense and at an more advanced level. This is a great course for those who are in engineering, programming, computer analytics, and robotics. But for others who are taking the course for curiosity or to learn more about the hype of AI and its automation on jobs, technology and consumable resources, be sure to take your time watching the videos and jotting down notes. The pre-recorded lectures can get wordy and a tad overwhelming. I believe this course will do better more visual examples, videos and web link resources than with a plethora of videos which is 9/10 talking and 1/10. visual learning. On a more positive note, I do appreciate and like that Professor Andrew Ng is passionate about AI and his expertise! "
2019-05-10 00:00:00,Alexander D,3.0,2.0,"The course is a high-level overview of the field of AI and data science. While it is to be expected that in an overview course one would cover many issues at a general and non-technical level, I think the course could benefit from being shortened to one or two weeks and focused more on the technical aspects,, such as, for example, the various applications of AI/machine learning and what the state-of-the-art is in the field. Much of what last week's videos focused on would be better left to economists who specifically study these issues (e.g., productivity, impact on jobs and developing countries, etc). Andrew is clearly an authority on AI, but that does not make him an authority on economics. Overall, I though the overview was useful, but I would shorten the course and exploit the instructor's comparative advantage in understanding the technical aspects. "
2019-03-06 00:00:00,Ian H,2.0,2.0,"Pretty basic and not very insightful. Some interesting videos and use cases, but was expecting a little more and a bit more challenging. "
2019-10-14 00:00:00,poornachand,2.0,2.0,Course Content is Just OK. Give a simple idea about AI.
2020-04-22 00:00:00,NATHAN W,2.0,2.0,"kind of vague. not much actual substance.

Sinceramente, al igual que otras personas, tenía ciertas dificultades para entender de forma acabada cómo era realmente esta tecnología (esto involucra la programación tras ella, sus clasificaciones, sus usos y, en definitiva, cómo estas aprendían a partir de datos).

Un excelente curso, todo lo que se aborda en él está muy bien explicado. Muchas gracias por todo."
2022-02-16 00:00:00,Sp D,5.0,1.0,"I​ thoroughly enjoyed every lecture of Andrew and really glad that I took this course. Very easy to follow and understand. A must course for anyone wishing to explore AI. Thanks for the course, Andrew."

I've met too many people that think AI will turn into killer robots XD"
2019-04-30 00:00:00,Mudit B,3.0,1.0,"Very good course

Postitive:
Clear commentary and methods of communication (visual, audio, etc)
Good pace for something relaxing
Easy to understand subject matter explained in a respectful way

Negative:
Locked quizzes
Some minor UI bugs when switching tracks, the checkmark doesn't activate. Also, the scrolling on page should keep video anchored, while speech-to-text scrolls.

Suggestions:
Unlock quizzes. People aren't going to pay $ for quizzes, but it helps in feeling satisfied. Locking them makes it feel like an attempt to get money, which makes sense if someone wants the Certificate, but not for quizzes. For example, should a school textbook (being borrowed from the library, perhaps) eliminate practice lessons with answers, and only provide quizzes if the book were used in a paid, formal educational setting?
If the goal is to monetize the course, then it makes sense. In that case, thank you for providing the content for free. I found it valuable and interesting."
2022-04-11 00:00:00,Shobha,3.0,1.0,"The course is very good. But it is very basic, for the amount paid. Could have been a little more advanced. "
2019-03-24 00:00:00,Tushar K R,5.0,0.0,"The lecture for AI course as delivered by Mr Andrew was excellent. And explained beautifully and I understand that it is to sweep the world. Considering its bias possibility and adversary attacks, it is important to get it controlled through licensing or Government enforced guidelines process. Depending on the level of AI, like Robotics in the space, it is needed to be under full control of UN and respective government so that fruits of the Technology can be beneficial to humankind all over the world. 
BBC documentary on world war II delineates destruction of humanity by people whose consciousness level could not be elevated. Nobody knows who is the enemy of the other side. Rishi Aurobindo who was the spiritual exponent died on 05 Dec, 1950 in his life-time was deeply meditating over the reason of the absence of compassion in some segment of the mankind. As theorized and practiced by Rishi Aurobindo - that consciousness level can be raised from inert matters and sees elevation to plant, animals, mankind and ultimately God through invoking of all-pervading divine forces and power. This principle if can be propagated to large mass of people will do good for the world along with evolution of AI."
2020-06-13 00:00:00,Raviraja S,5.0,0.0,"  This course gave me an abstract view of AI as well as a realistic view of AI i.e. a high level sense of what AI can and can not do.  So, for someone who is first trying to understand what is AI all about, what are the key tools of AI i.e. Machine Learning including Deep Learning and Data Science, this course provides a right perspective. It also mentions good case studies about complex AI products as well as the roles and responsibilities of large AI teams. AI transformation playbook will be really helpful for companies to get the feel of AI and strategies it for the right future of AI in their company. Finally there is a good perspective on how AI can impact society and how we can navigate the rise of AI in future. The course finally teaches us to keep learning to build knowledge.  Great foundational course and very well narrated by professor Andrew Ng. "
2019-04-29 00:00:00,Luis A S d A,5.0,0.0,"Este foi o meu primeiro curso sobre Inteligência Artificial, então isso deve ser levado em consideração na minha avaliação - ou seja, quem for ler deve saber disso. outro ponto importante é que não tenho background técnico. Dito isso, o curso foi bastante válido como um primeiro passo para entender o que é IA e, principalmente, o que preciso levar em consideração quando penso em ""criar"" uma aplicação em IA ou quando uma empresa pensa em fazer algo assim. Consegui caminhar os primeiros passos neste entendimento. O que seria importante como sugestão é uma continuação do curso, dando dicas do que devemos buscar conforme nossos objetivos e grau de conhecimento. Em resumo, não posso opinar sobre a qualidade do curso para quem já tem um background no assunto. Mas para as pessoas que, como eu, não tem conhecimento nem formação técnica, o curso é valido.  "
2022-08-02 00:00:00,Usman N,5.0,0.0,"My review of Coursera’s one of the most popular AI courses, the AI For Everyone by none other than Andrew Ng, An AI pioneer, and Coursera founder.
his course is informative and interesting, and it will teach you AI basics without boring you with complex details. The length of the course is also just nice. The presentation is both interesting and engaging, which makes learning easier.  
As I said then, AI for everyone’s courses is a great introductory course to give everyone theoretical knowledge about Artificial Intelligence.
Not only can programmers understand how artificial intelligence can be implemented and how it is used in your life, but any non-technical person can also join this course to understand how AI is changing the future and the impact of AI in modern life.
 Andrew Ng, is a genius and master teacher.  Thank you sir "
2021-02-18 00:00:00,Rakesh R,5.0,0.0,"Artificial intelligence is one of the most talked technologies these days. No business is left untouched from this advanced technology. From automated cars to chat bots, AI has made our life a lot simpler. The usage and implementation of AI is being explored in almost all the industries. In simpler words AI is everywhere and it is ruling this generation of transformational technologies which has the capability to change the way we look at technology. AI is about to bring a disruption in times to come and thus an understanding of AI becomes invariably important. This course gives you a basic understanding of AI and its capabilities and limitations. Andrew is an amazing instructor and his lectures are on point. AI is the new electricity and thus we need to leverage this unbelievably strong technology for the benefit of mankind."
2020-07-15 00:00:00,Dr A J,5.0,0.0,"It has been a wonderful experience learning AI, I am a Management Faculty, Dr. Anupama, Associate Professor in a Management School, in Hyderabad, Telangana , India. I always had curiosity to understand AI, as my children are graduating in computer science and having heard this buzz word, AI... could learn about it, and will continue to learn and see how to make use of it. Adding to it is Mr.ANDREW'S LUCID way of teaching which made it much more interesting. Im really thankful to Mr,Andrew for his patience and explanation which anyone can understand. Finally, i feel fortunate to learn this course from course era, with out which, this could not have been possible. Thank you once again, i will make all my friends who are equally interested in learning something new to attend this course.Thank you once again."
2022-07-11 00:00:00,Pankaj S,5.0,0.0,"It is very good foundation course on AI . The topics where discussed in a very simple way with supporting examples.
After this course one yearns to learn more and update oneself   to what is happening around world.
One nice myth which Andrew cleared is that AI is not successful everywhere you can have failures and also results may not come instantly in some cases that may take some time. Otherwise you do not find this type of clear message from any news letter, news paper- technology editorials.
Thank  you very much Mr Andrew.
With Kind Regards                                                                                                                                                                                                         Pankaj Kumar Sharma

The first step in any course is to understand basics about the subject which is provided by this course about AI. As we see that AI is the future in any industry, the person belonging to technical as well as non technical background can study AI.This course is well designed for beginners. Being a beginner in AI, I understood the concept of AI, what it can do,most importantly what it cannot do, its limitations, steps to follow to implement AI, impact of AI on economy and society. Finally, I am confident that because of this course, I will be able to develop a suitable project to make system efficient and intelligent. I thank Coursera for providing such a nice course."
2019-06-28 00:00:00,Sonia,5.0,0.0,"This course helped learn the difference between a Data Science and ML project and build an intuition of how I can apply this iin my context. For example, data science can help derive insights about user behavior in consuming learning content. For this I learned that gathering data from various sources and connecting the patterns in the data set, is what data can help. Once I have this then maybe I can build a ML to make recommendations at the right time at the right place users to pick a new skill or a new trend. This means if I can learn about Data Science tools, ML and synthesize it with my design, user experience, I can operate at the intersection of the two and future proof my skills. Thank you for building this course."
2020-02-08 00:00:00,Ivette G,5.0,0.0,Exceptional! I enjoyed this course very much. It has demystified some misinformation about AI's capabilities. It has also help me feel comfortable with the technology and insights as to its applicability in the eLearning industry.  I like that the videos are short and topics flow sequentially.  Your examples are on-point with what is currently available in the real world. Your wit and charm also added to you delivery.  I will in deed keep learning I am hook on AI.  Thank you as well for taking the time and putting so much effort in creating these video. You are a true defender of AI and showing those that take this course the truth about AI and that it is not an evil technology aim to destroy the human race. 
2020-06-19 00:00:00,Aarthi L S,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course for leaders looking at building AI teams within their organizational unit
Teams getting started with launching AI in their org often have this notion of ML being a magic wand and along with that comes unrealistic expectations. The course helps you choose an appropriate AI project, set realistic goals, workflow of a ML project and pitfalls to avoid which will enable a successful MVP.
The final week course cautions us on how our real-life biases of race and gender can spill into AI.An awareness of this is essential for ensuring that atleast the virtual world is free of bias.
Overall, a must-do course if you want to enable your org to embrace AI and your team to take their first steps in AI.  "
2021-12-17 00:00:00,Ahmad M,5.0,0.0,"G​reat introductury course about AI. You will learn the basics and the most important knowledge about AI. Professor Andrew NG is a great teacher and explained concepts very well. 
I​mportant note: In general, starting to learn about new things can be hard, why? Because it is pattern in life when something has potential it gets alot of hype. The internet will be overloaded in info. What you want to do is navigate through the noise and focus on what is important. The best way to do this is to start in a beginner mind state, and the second best thing is to do ia to enroll  in the best reviewed content about your new topic. This course satsified this criteria and it is excellent."
2020-04-27 00:00:00,Anirudh S,5.0,0.0,"  I took this course to get an understanding of Artificial Intelligence and how it would relate to my work. I must say that the course has been highly informative and given me an insight into the utility and limitations of Artificial Intelligence. I understood the general working of an AI system, with many examples, and the impacts AI can make on businesses, at present and in the near future. It was also interesting to know the inter-relation among AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. Furthermore, I feel that understanding the factors to take into consideration while selecting an AI project is very important, which has been dealt with adeptly in course.  "
2019-03-28 00:00:00,Sébastien L,5.0,0.0,"I just finished this course and I must say I loved the teaching style of Andrew Ng! He is enthusiastic, he cares about his audience and promotes an ethical use of AI while making complicated topics such as machine learning and deep learning accessible to the public. ""AI for Everyone"" is really an appropriate title for this course: you may be a complete beginner or a more advanced user, you will certainly find something interesting along the way. Even if you knew about all the topics being covered here, it would still be a great refresher as it's quick and well presented. Cheers to Andrew! I will for sure enroll in all other courses offered by this competent lecturer."
2020-06-19 00:00:00,Harshit K G,5.0,0.0,"The course is well-prepared to give a brief theoretical overview of Artificial Intelligence, and also includes its various aspects starting from Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to revealing various types of AI, and even explains for a realistic view of AI. This course is a must to have a brief knowledge on AI, and getting a sound knowledge on talking AI. It does not involve any programming, but offers good amount of easy to cover and nicely explained theory.

I am glad to finish this course, and would recommend it to anyone willing to start with the concepts of AI, by the expert, Andrew NG sir (Co-Founder of Coursera)."
2021-09-26 00:00:00,Raguram M,5.0,0.0,"Learnt the basic concepts of AI, its limitations. Data is one of the most important thing for any organization. By this course understood how data can be used for making decisions through AI & how we can automate routine tasks using machine learning.

2021-01-26 00:00:00,Deepak T,5.0,0.0,"I had great learning through this course and can say that I am now more aware of what AI is and all the related concepts. This really is need of the hour to keep ourselves updated on the latest technology. By acquiring knowledge and better understanding one could make good use of the same by implementing in an appropriate manner mostly focusing on the positive side but also keeping in mind the negative side of over using the technology. To keep it simple, we should follow GOLDILOCKS rule which is neither ""NOT TOO OPTIMISTIC"" nor "" TOO PESSIMISTIC"" but ""JUST BE RIGHT"". I would like to thank  Mr. Andrew for keeping the course simple yet convincing."
2019-10-30 00:00:00,Alejandro E M C,5.0,0.0,"This is a basic introductory course about AI. With personal experiences and easy teaching style, Andrew Ng explained what exactly is AI, and what exactly are each trending terms, such as ""Machine Learning"", ""Data Science"", ""Big Data"", etc. Andrew is an inspring professor, teaching with clear and easy style. One of the best part of this course is the consideration of ethical issues. Andrew offers us his own ""trained neural network"" (not artificial), coming from his experience, providing exclusive and very valuable experiences and tips from his own role as AI developer in Google. Thank you very much, Andrew, for sharing your experience with us!. "
2020-09-04 00:00:00,Hugo M M d C,5.0,0.0,"To cover very quickly AI, as the latest ""hot"" area of knowledge and/or topic/field of business decisions, this is an excellent course for a non-technical person (and technical person too - business side of AI). The course is very well structured. The teacher is also excellent and very clear in its several explanations. I have the following suggestion that could improve the robustness of this course: in each block, add bibliography and/or materials if someone wants to dive deep in some special topic of the course (or specific block's course). Anyway, I strongly recommend other people (technical and non-technical) to take this course."
2021-04-12 00:00:00,Togu N,5.0,0.0,"It was a great fun learning about the buzzy words AI, ML and many other things covered in this course. I would recommend people to join this course. Although the course was relatively short when compared to many other courses online, this course included a lot of information that would help any individual or a business or any other organization make a kick start in AI. I am really thankful to Mr. Andrew for keeping this course interesting and useful up till the end. I also thank Coursera for engaging in global education, which we are in desperate need of.
Now, I am confident that I can learn the technical part of AI efficiently."
2020-06-28 00:00:00,Harsh G,5.0,0.0,"When I started this course, I thought it would be a more technical one, as a I am a student of Computer Science. I felt more and more excluded in some of the videos which were explaining about the business aspects of AI. Then as I started the 4th week, I felt so happy about this course, because after all the 4 weeks, I gain so many different point-of-views about AI and realized all that in the 4th week while learning the AI's effect on society. Although I would have been a bit happier, if the technical part of this course is raised a little.
Thank you Professor Ng for teaching us wonderful things."
2020-07-11 00:00:00,Amit T,5.0,0.0,"Before this course, I had completely reverse perspective about the capabilities of AI. Going through the course material, gradually, a certain different side of information about AI developed within me. I know, this perspective, which I obtained through the divine words of Andrew Ng will help me through out my life in pursuing my passion in the field of AI and Cyber Security. I love reading continuously about the things that I am passionate about; therefore, I am going enroll in your next course of Machine Learning.

He is able to engage his listeners and explain and illustrate difficult concepts with many good examples from his rich personal experiences and wealth of knowledge.  It is a great joy to attend the course and Prof Andrew has certainly piqued my interest in Artificial Intelligence.  Also, from the way Prof Andrew shares his viewpoints and stories, I can see that he is an highly ethical and principled man of strong moral values.  Well done!  Keep up your awesome work  "
2020-06-27 00:00:00,Ahmed A,5.0,0.0,"It is a very good introduction to AI, but not in technical way. Very good if you are a CEO or someone who is in a management role and either you are considering or want to consider AI in your business. Or maybe someone who is new to technology or programming fields and want to know what is this all fuss about. 
One disclaimer though, I finished this course for free. You will learn new things I assure you, however, I can not be so sure if its worth a lot of money. So, I encourage you to prioritize your budget, Specially if you are after technical Knowledge, there is basically none here. "
2019-07-15 00:00:00,Daniel E,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed the course, but I would recommend a few additional elements that would strengthen its impact:
1) add a few brief interviews with either pioneers in AI applications and/or business leaders who are using or considering adoption of AI.
2) A few short videos detailing robotics work (Boston Dynamics, Tesla, etc.), AI in prediction of stock markets data, and/or use in social engineering or non-profit undertakings.
3) Greater use of non-trivial business problems or examination of how AI or machine learning can help in elimination socially destructive industries (oil, coal, insurance)."
2020-05-10 00:00:00,KHALEEL U R K,5.0,0.0,"A great course for those who have no exposure to AI or want to clear their doubts about AI.
This course gives an understanding of the different technical terms and aspects related to AI. Different terms such as deep learning, machine learning, neural networks etc. are very well explained in this course giving both its technical and non-technical meanings. It also covers topics such as how to make a company an AI-first company and different aspects related to the use of AI in companies. Lastly, Andrew talks about the disadvantages of AI could have on society and ways to overcome it."

This course goes hand in hand with https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. Prof point out that narrow AI is everywhere & mostly push forward by large amount of data. Spike in computing power and petabyte of various form of data push current stage of ML. Prof clarify about data science and ML in general, and describe sub fields in ML. Finally how AI company and team formation should be, redefine timeline, budget, scope for better AI projects, finally coined multiple job terms relate with ML."
2020-01-05 00:00:00,Mary B,5.0,0.0,"This is a good foundation for understanding AI.  I would like more on choosing a task, planning and coding for a basic AI application. I enjoyed this course and learned a lot about how AI works, what it's limitations are, how it learns, what is used to ""teach"" AI, how it can be biased, how it can be hacked, why the data fed into AI must be correct in order for it to work correctly and much more.  I would like more on the subject of AI.  How to choose a task, code and implement it.  I really enjoyed this course.  Alexander Ng presents the material in an interesting manner."

2021-02-04 00:00:00,Meander A,5.0,0.0,"Delivery is calm, easy to understand regardless of prior background, simple but good examples, although it stayed at rather high-level about a wide field of areas you could see that Andrew is a master of the topic and hence he can simplify it to the easiest level and still being meaningful and interesting, that is the art of teaching. 
Thank you Andrew and now let's go into the next level of ML/DL and activate what is left of my linear algebra knowledge and get my coding skills refreshed that wasn't used for 20+ years   "
2021-02-14 00:00:00,Moonyong K,5.0,0.0,"Along with the contents, which I found very useful for general knowledge in AI and ML, the professor's true intention of teaching and working on AI are delivered quite clearly. I seek the knowledge in AI to first broaden my knowledge and my skill but I think it is important to remember the intention. I should keep in mind that it is primarily to bring the society the better world through the technology and my skill and not just building up my own career for better paycheck or reputation. Thank you for the lesson. "
2020-07-26 00:00:00,Sin H Y,5.0,0.0,"Great Introduction course to anyone that is new to AI, or who have heard of AI but never figure the jargon such as Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning, Reinforce Learning and more. Through the short and neat explanation by Andrew, now I grasp a ""Goldilock"" picture of what AI is - not being overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic on it.
Just completed the whole course today (approx. 1 hour a week) --- I would suggest this for anyone that wants a better understanding of AI. It definitely worth the time."

You know you're right about how AI gets mystified in the general public. Especially because of how AI is portrayed in film/entertainment. I especially liked the simplified explanations about self driving cars. A bit sad that ""Dolores and Maeve from Westworld"" are hundreds of years away lol Seriously I am inspired to learn a bit further I don't feel as intimidated as before this course. Thanks :) "
2020-06-04 00:00:00,Lahiru H S,5.0,0.0,Most classes available online deal with the detailed technical aspects and do not address important yet widely discussed broader issues or phenomena related to AI. Issues such as how to gauge it's value and what it can and cannot do. As a result you have armchair critics/experts feeding hype and hysteria in general. This course is brilliant in its competent and clear analysis of the actual state of AI and what AI will bring us in the future. As always Andrew Ng shows his teaching brilliance! Excellent indeed!
2019-09-12 00:00:00,Sidharth S,5.0,0.0,"This is a great introductory course with little to no technical studies on AI. Every single person on Coursera can take this course and learn a lot of new things about AI, and also learn on how AI can be implemented by you, and how accessible it is. But at the same time the course shows, how you can make your AI economically valuable or you can make yourself valuable by adding skills to yourself in the right niche of AI, since AI is very large sector. Thank you Andrew and Coursera for this wonderful course."
2019-03-25 00:00:00,Rachel M,5.0,0.0,"I found this course very useful in building fluency around AI and machine learning, and developing an understanding of projects that are well suited (or not) to be tackled by AI.

Not like the other Machine Learning course I took before, this course teaches you all the basics you need to now about current AI development and help you understand how to evaluate the feasibility and process for you to implment in real life.  No coding required.  Content is well-structured and easy to digest.  Yet, it does provide a sound foundation for anyone to have an overview of AI.  Highly recommended and absolutely enjoy learning it. "
2020-08-17 00:00:00,Cynthia,5.0,0.0,"  If your goal is to get a realistic picture of AI and to be able to understand what AI projects take, you are in the right place. Explanation of terminologies using examples set a good foundation for beginners to follow and digest. Course emphasizes a lot on what AI can do and cannot do, as well as limitations in real applications, which is something we normally don't get from the media and general literature. Insights on ML project management applies to general project managements too.  "
2021-11-07 00:00:00,Ridvan B,5.0,0.0,"A good primer regarding Artificial Intelligence. The instructorAndrew NgofDeepLearning.AIgave valuable insights regarding AI and definitely removed the barrier of the many buzzwords I hear about AI. The major thing that I learned from this course is what AI can and cannot do, and that we can start executing pilot projects to gain momentum. 

Next steps: re-learn Python, OpenCV, and maybe other ML frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

2020-05-04 00:00:00,Husayn Z A,5.0,0.0,"Amazing course! Everything explained is very easy to understand, even for those who have never heard of the term AI in their life. Andrew Ng has a very slow talking pace, making it easy for everyone to understand what he is saying. The course involves him drawing on a number of graphs to highlight and explain important concepts (I may have screen shotted some of the graphs for further reference ;) ) which I think is a very effective strategy for learning something."
2019-11-03 00:00:00,Hitesh K,5.0,0.0,"It was really useful to get a holistic view of AI. The course conent is just perfect covering on various aspects of AI (technical, business values, workflow of an AI project, capability building, society etc.).

2019-03-26 00:00:00,Furkan,5.0,0.0,"Really great course that gives you a good understanding of business as well as technical aspects of AI. 
My key takeaway is the importance of first starting with AI projects (pilots) before thinking about adopting AI strategy. 50% planning and 50% implementation is always better than trying to plan 100%. Another interesting topic was the advice for developing countries on how they could have a kick-start on AI, by focusing on their industry strengths."
2019-04-30 00:00:00,Estelle,5.0,0.0,"Anyone interested in AI should take this course. I would even encourage everyone to take it, since having a basic understanding of how AI works should probably be part of general knowledge in today's world. As a project manager in robotics with a non technical background, I was already familiar with many topics addressed in the videos. However, this is the first time I see them addressed in such a clear, understandable way. Thank you Andrew Ng!"
2019-10-31 00:00:00,Aryani T,5.0,0.0,"Andrew speaks clearly with proper speed for us to understand. The sample and presentation are helpful for me to digest the meaning. AI is an interesting topic, in this course I know the basic how it works, and AI must be very useful in the future to replace routine jobs so people could more focus on other more attractive tasks, some new jobs would replace current jobs, we have to always adapt with the new environment to survive. Thank you."

2019-04-05 00:00:00,Sharad A,5.0,0.0,"Very simple and lucid way to introduce AI technology to beginners. A complicated looking concept is explained in a logical step by step manner in such a way that the learner is never left feeling bored / disconnected with the topics. 
The last section on Impact of AI on Society could be slightly shortened / made optional as it is less of technical and more of factual information which maybe of more interest to advanced users of AI."
2020-06-04 00:00:00,Sanika D,5.0,0.0,"The course instructor Andrew sir just simplified the complex concept of AI which is very much exaggerated elsewhere. If this message could anyway reach to him, I would like to thank him for introducing me to the beautiful world of AI so easily and effectively.

2019-03-05 00:00:00,Dan H,4.0,0.0,"The course is a solid high level introduction to the concepts of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and mentions (in passing) some deeper concepts like natural language processing and knowledge graphs.  I enjoyed it!  My critical feedback revolves around the final week: I appreciated the attention given to ethics in AI, but it seems worth mentioning that efforts to eliminate bias and prejudice are themselves inherently based on judgement calls, and will reflect the value(s) of the person(s) making those judgements.  Since this course is aimed at business leaders, I suggest adding some verbiage to the need for an enterprise to articulate those values in a manner that supports their inclusion (at an engineering level) into the techniques, data, and algorithms being developed by those AI teams."
2020-10-16 00:00:00,John R,4.0,0.0,"Thoughtful, great overview of real-world AI use cases and some decent info on what may be involved in working with an AI company and starting to think about creating an internal AI team. Good (and very timely) thoughts on how AI has been and continues to be misused in PsyOps - affecting perceptions of political candidates and parties (without going too far into accusations) - very helpful in recognizing real risks and future implications and dispelling myths. Great overview, but not a starter for those that want to actually get into AI. It's not going to teach machine learning, but it may point you towards an overall understanding of how it all ties together. Great course for the over-eager exec who demands some innovation without doing any research into what to expect. "
2021-06-24 00:00:00,Arjuna T,4.0,0.0,"Good overview of current state of AI tech in many industries, from a business perspective. Andrew is a great instructor and provides a lot of clarity in these lectures. Would recommend if you work in a role that interfaces with AI teams or AI products, but this course may not be deep enough for more technical folks. I appreciate the inclusion of the executive perspective on building teams and strategizing, but I ended up treating it as supplemental information as it was not relevant to my current role. Would have also appreciated a bit more depth in the discussion about the models. Overall consider this course an 8.5/10 for me personally, but it may be a 10/10 depending on your needs :)"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,ALBERTO L,4.0,0.0,"This course is a pretty good introductional course on AI, it's effective and broad enough. Yet I can't help but feeling like it was a bit to geared towards companies and it panders to them heavily to the point of getting a bit akward in some points, I also feel like some points were a bit too biased from the point of view of someone inside the industry. I can't put it into words but hopefully someone does understand what I mean and will try to adjust the aim of the course. I want to stress that this criticism of mine is very personal and comes from someone with great inexperience so of course it has to be taken with a grain of salt"
2020-09-21 00:00:00,Khalil K,4.0,0.0,"This course was a highly informative, non-technical course as to generally what A.I. is, what it can or can't do, understanding it's particular vulnerabilities, how to start introducing A.I. methodologies into a company, its potential value both economic and societal, as well as a look at the potential impacts on society and solutions. It is a very very good primer on understanding the subject if you have no clue as to what AI is. Some statements in the course do seem just a tad little dismissive in terms of the potential impacts of implementation, but other than this the course was fine. I would recommend."
2019-03-14 00:00:00,Hans K,4.0,0.0,I love Andrew Ng's teaching style and his simple presentation of materials such that the average person can understand how AI will impact the world and global economy. I've taken his Machine Learning course for practitioners which is much more technical and goes into full depth.  The only reason I wouldn't rate this as a 5-star is because there seems to be a business angle to the course in the sense that it's a pitch to companies looking to utilize Landing AI's services.   Would recommend this to anyone looking to learn a bit more about AI and how it'll impact their lives.
2019-11-25 00:00:00,Martin W,4.0,0.0,"The course applies cognitivistic ideas of learning with frontal learning (videos) and quizzes (memorization) which is only as good as a scaffold to getting real knowledge (building mental models by applying them to the world and getting feedback on the usage). 
It could easily be improved by having learners write articles where they apply the material to their current situation and have it peer reviewed by other learners (use and refine mental models). Moderators would have to check for mistakes, but it stays more or less scalable.
Still good material, though."
2020-08-08 00:00:00,Kruthi G,4.0,0.0,"The course actually did what it promises: AI for Everyone. Well designed, with true examples, this course is the best for a beginner entering the world of AI. 
Andrew Ng has an amazing way to transform complexity into simple, understandable words. I definitely recommend it as one of the most valuable courses I have attended so far.
Thank you, Andrew!  
But a little disappointed and not satisfied with the certificate format offered by Coursera it provides signature other than Andrew and does not have a Coursera certified message on the right corner below.

"
2020-06-11 00:00:00,Nicholas W J C,4.0,0.0,"the way the course was conducted was precise and had examples to back up the different topics that was discussed. The analogies used were interesting and applicable to real world problems and the teacher had a nice sounding passive voice that made the experience a lot better to take in. The only complaint I have is that the video audio is relatively softer compared to everything else in the background so I had to turn it up, but other than that I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking forward to learning the basics of AI."
2019-05-14 00:00:00,Daniyal A S,4.0,0.0,"This is quite an informative course on what is AI, what it's capable of currently, and how you can launch AI projects in your own organisation.  Andrew Ng goes one step one further and talks about AI and it's role in societies and ethics. Though since it's just information, learners are not assigned any project-type assignment which makes it easy to forget. I managed to score almost 100% in all the quizzes because I make detailed notes but I still doubt I'd be able to retain the info if I don't get an opportunity soon to apply what I learned."
2019-03-26 00:00:00,geoffrey a,4.0,0.0,"Small and medium businesses are also able to use data science, machine learning, and AI but they do not have the money to hire permanent staff dedicated for it. What they can do is buy the software and consulting services for AI, data science, and machine learning.  It would be nice to see coverage of how small and medium businesses can use AI.  Consider TurboTax, which is a popular software developed by software engineers but used by many small tax accounting businesses that cannot afford to individually hire a full time software engineer."
2020-07-30 00:00:00,Krishnamoorthi,4.0,0.0,Really excellent that professor simplified the current status of AI with fantastic real time example and case studies. He really emphasized the point that there are also problem statements which AI can't do and also mentioned how media over-hyped the AI. Some significant points which i liked really  that even if data set is small we can start AI project on that and also our expertise area along with some AI can uplift us on our career.  Thank you so much for the professor and coursera team for this wonderful course for AI basics. thank you
2019-10-15 00:00:00,erik s,4.0,0.0,"Very good overview of AI in all its aspects: technical, business and organisational, pleasantly and clearly explained by Andrew Ng.
I think everyone interested in AI should start with this course, but as it is 'just' an overview it tends to be a bit superficial and require additional learning to really get started yourself (from knowing to doing). I also recommend the AI primer on YouTube to get some more insights into AI. Together you have a fuller picture of this new and exciting field. Good luck!"
2020-07-10 00:00:00,Vignesh S,4.0,0.0,"This course will help us to open our vision towards an AI world with optimistic content. We could able to achieve a fundamental knowledge of AI and their systematic functionalities coupled with business knowledge and ethics. It has complete tutelage for the beginners and I personally felt this course may be protracted to pay a way and complete guidelines to young aspirants with widening the purview of this course.
Thanks Andrew Ng, It was a wonderful experience of learning."
2021-04-28 00:00:00,Thokachichu T,4.0,0.0,"Had a great time learning basics and gaining a general idea about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This course is pretty much a well done in-depth introduction, probably suited for anyone who just set their foot into the world of AI as it nicely demystifies the general myths and doubts about AI among masses. Mr. Andrew did his best in guiding us to have a good mindset and general outlook of the ever expanding use of AI in today's technological revolution."
2020-05-20 00:00:00,Anastasia M P,4.0,0.0,"The course was very well prepared and presented. It was easy to understand what is AI, how it works, where can be applied and how AI will changes our lives and the way businesses operate in near future. All the examples hat were used were explained in a simple manner as of to understand the basics of AI. Clear explanations were given. The course triggered my mind as to challenge my knowledge on the filed of my expertise and find new areas of development. "
2019-09-30 00:00:00,Carlos V,4.0,0.0,"Quality videos and very well structured. It is certainly just an introduction, useful for managers and executives with no o very limited previous knowledge of the field. The course requires light workload of no more than 1-2 hours per week. I missed a bit more of depth of the tools needed to deliver AI, fundamentals of neural networks and algorithms and the actual work required to deliver an AI project. Otherwise, very helpful and well delivered. "
2019-03-18 00:00:00,Jay S,4.0,0.0,"This course provided a wide-ranging overview of the landscape and issues regarding the rise of artificial intelligence.  The instructor provides definitions of  terminology, structure of issues,  and also the limits of artificial intelligence.  Optional videos are available for a more in-depth look at some of the specific topics.  Well worth the time spent on the class. This course provides a firm foundation to pursue additional learning in AI.  "
2019-05-31 00:00:00,Dinesh J,4.0,0.0,"I wanted to know a non-technical introduction to AI, ML, etc. This suited particularly well and very informative and gives good amount of current status and future directions of AI. Though I have been in and out of good old days (late 80's and early 90's) of AI (heard about Expert systems, Prolog, Lisp, etc. ?) never got convinced AI can be practical as it is today. This course definitely made me look up and us AI where applicable."
2020-07-07 00:00:00,Jordan S,4.0,0.0,"I previewed this course 6 months ago and came back to it once it was offered through my school as part of a new initiative. I really enjoyed the course and the content was effective enough that with minimal, and I mean minimal review (30 min) I passed all of the quizzes. The material is covered in such a way that key concepts are carried through the material and stick with you. One of the best Coursera courses I have taken so far. "
2020-01-05 00:00:00,TIAGO F M,4.0,0.0,"My expectations were to understand what AI is and some practice as a programmer. I could learn the several terminologies, some that I had never heard before. I also liked to know it is not the same as the brain neurons. It was for sure a good content to understand about the topic. This is not yet a course to deploy a project but it gives you some highways. I 'd recomend for anyone that wants to know more about the subject AI."
2019-08-28 00:00:00,Kayode O,4.0,0.0,"It's a very insightful course which gives the basic knowledge of AI, thereby providing a springboard to further enhance ones study into broader area of deep learning, machine language, data science, and how it could strengthen industries, economies as well as getting rid of some jobs and creating new sets of jobs even much more than what it rids off, in as much as one is willing and able to learn new skill-sets."
2019-04-01 00:00:00,Muryani K,4.0,0.0,"The course gives a great overview of the basics of AI, without getting too much into the technical. Andrew Ng is a great presenter, the curriculum was presented clearly. I just wished that with a certification track, I got a chance to present a case study of how AI is used in my own field and I could get feedback for my idea. It felt like the $50 certification track didn't offer much compared to the free one. "
2020-01-25 00:00:00,Michael T,4.0,0.0,The lecturer is very knowledgeable and the slides are helpful.  This is a very high level overview of AI - Much of it I already new but the lecturer rounded out my knowledge.  The one thing I did not like was the format of quizzes at the end of a unit (7-10 videos).  I have taken other courses through Coursera where the quizzes are every 1-2 videos.  I think this is sounder learning principle.
2020-05-02 00:00:00,Divya G,4.0,0.0,"The course was very engaging. I felt that it is extremely important today to know the basics of artificial intelligence in order to understand the basic functioning of so many services and facilities that use AI and we are already using them without actually knowing how they function!
the course was very informative. 
Thank you so much, Prof. Andrew Ng, for the wonderful delivery of the course!"
2020-06-30 00:00:00,HARIKRISHNAN P A,4.0,0.0,This course provides one with the basic and the perfect introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI). I was able to clear all my hypes and misunderstanding about AI technology by attending this course. I am very thankful to Our Mentor - Andre Ng Sir for providing these explanation in a simple way so that beginners like me can find  easiness while going through the lectures. 
2019-12-11 00:00:00,Antti K,4.0,0.0,"The course provided good broad look into AI and did good job in explaining key terms such as machine learning, data science etc. The narration was clear and the progression of the course was reasonable.

I would had wished the testing of the course to be more rigorous, to better test what I learned with my input and also making the certificate earned more valuable."
2020-12-22 00:00:00,CARNET E,4.0,0.0,"It's a very interesting intro to AI world ... may need some more deep information but for a manager to understand complexity of AI it's good enough. 
for what I've seen of the 2nd level training, some intermediate training should be proposed for Product Manager or Product Owner  ; to provide a  relative deeper knowledge of AI but without going deep into techno"
2020-11-30 00:00:00,Yee M S J,4.0,0.0,"Andrew Ng is a fantastic trainer. Very understanding, knowledgeable and most importantly, he came off very strongly as someone who cares for the society and is grounded with good moral values. His tone, diction and pace is good. His personality is so engaging and attractive that I found myself starting off being dreading the course to enjoying the course."
2020-08-10 00:00:00,Nikita,4.0,0.0,"I loved this course. As a novice to IT field, the content of the course was well organized and was enough for a newbie to understand about the AI, its benefits and its limitations. I liked the pace of the trainer, neither too slow to bore you nor too fast to miss any information. I hope the next courses in AI have similar effect.Thank you!"
2019-03-31 00:00:00,Chris I H,4.0,0.0,"Great course to taste some of the amazing world of Artificial Intelligence. It surrounds you in the world of AI showing the many topics for understanding the reaches of the technology. It will not require you to program anything, but you might get the itch of continuing to implement some of the theory learnt here (you have been warned!)."
2020-08-16 00:00:00,K K K,4.0,0.0,"The course is purely non-technical. This is kind of good course for someone who is completely unknown to wonders of technology, explained in basic words at the best. This is definitely not for everyone. But, if you want to have just an ""idea"" on AI, then you must do this course. Will look forward for Andrew sir's technical class."
2019-11-28 00:00:00,Francois S,4.0,0.0,"Very interesting course that made me reflect on the applicability of AI in my job environment. Thank you very much for sharing your expertise.
One small improvement would be to re-run the speech recognition system on the video as many words in the written version of the course are incorrectly spelled. Other than that thumbs up!"
2019-05-19 00:00:00,"E. R "" A",4.0,0.0,"Very educational and should be part of every school's curriculum starting no later than 7th grade.  The presentation was perfectly balanced thereby allowing the student to better absorb course material and actually, reflect on the content. I highly recommend this course! Why? Because it is indeed . . .
 ""AI for Everyone!"""
2020-11-28 00:00:00,Mert O,4.0,0.0,"Some parts were unnecessary for me and I don't think that CEO or any engineer who is working in any company, takes this course. Instead of them, students prefer to take the course, so some changements would be better about some topics and it would be better if had much examples about AI systems that are working now."
2020-11-15 00:00:00,Aniruddha P,4.0,0.0,"The course is good for preliminary understanding of AI. If you have no background knowledge or know few bits and wondering what it is about, the course give you much of the understanding [of the basic concept]. This can be seen as kick starter course to leap into courses based on Advanced AI, Machine Learning etc."
2019-03-26 00:00:00,Jagdeep P,4.0,0.0,"This course was very basic compared to what I expected it to be. Hence I would,nt really say it tested my knowledge or gave me too many fundamental concepts that I did not already know. However looking at it objectively, I feel that for someone totally uninitiated into AI & ML, this could be a good starting point."
2020-05-31 00:00:00,Philip V K,4.0,0.0,"Ng is an awesome professor.  I made it through this particular course pretty quick before I moved on to Ng's Machine Learning.  It gave me a great overall understanding of what AI is and how to differentiate (or not) between Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Data Science, ...  Thanks Coursera, Stanford and Ng! "
2019-12-31 00:00:00,Daniel H,4.0,0.0,"A good introduction. Would have loved to see if CRISP-DM can be used and also more use cases from real world enterprises. Maybe a survey by industries (verticals) and what they typically implement, e.g. Financial Service with fraud or churn or in Telecom cases like network failure and predictive maintenance. "
2020-08-10 00:00:00,Sahil K,4.0,0.0,"This Course provides a quite detailed Knowledge about A.I, and found course very interesting for Everyone who desire to learn about A.I. One unique thing at last week, that is very useful is, we also learn about, how to use A.I for betterment of society and its effects on society as well as future with A.I.  "
2021-01-03 00:00:00,Ahmet B G,4.0,0.0,It is a good course to basically understand what AI is and what it can do or not. But there is mostly no technical information about it so it was a little bit disappointing for me to learn nothing from engineer side. But thanks for everything. It makes me want to start a new course which is more technical.
2019-05-31 00:00:00,Jorge B,4.0,0.0,"Great course, I learned a lot even though I follow a lot of news about this and what Tesla is doing. The teacher is easy to follow, although do not count on the subtitles in english which are incorrect and can be confusing. The course is quite basic and I did expect a bit more difficulty, hens my 4 stars. "
2021-01-18 00:00:00,GODHAN S,4.0,0.0,"  This course helped me understand the AI from the basics. This course is very informative and explained clearly with examples. I am glad to have this opportunity to learn about AI and thanks to Coursera & Ashok Leyland for the excellent opportunity .

2019-08-21 00:00:00,Fabian P C,4.0,0.0,El curso esta muy bien estructurado y anima a hacer buen uso de las aplicaciones IA. Explica de manera clara y presenta buenos ejemplos aunque es muy genérico. Es un buen curso para empezar a comprender la tecnologia IA y saber que debes tener en cuenta antes de aplicarla en tu empresa.
2020-05-22 00:00:00,SEGNI W,4.0,0.0,Nice! :) This is a nice course for everyone as its course name suggests.

2020-04-23 00:00:00,Perry B,3.0,0.0,"Clearly structures course. Touching base on several aspects off AI. Easy to follow and comprehend over duration of the course. Liked the tone, speed and clear articulate way of presenting by the instructor. Would say that this is entry level for anyone wanting to learn about what AI is and what it can/cannot do. Examples of AI systems in practice are somewhat abstract or simple. It would have been nice to see more complicated real life examples of used AI or better said ML systems. A lot can also be learned or taken up by reading current papers by leading companies."
2020-07-04 00:00:00,Marina A,3.0,0.0,"I really esteem this course. Dr Andrew Ng is a pleasure to learn from because he is very knowledgeable, experienced and talks in a calm and respectful voice. The course material is structural in a very clear and easy to access manner with many short videos that makes it excellent for home learning. I would have preferred more practical tasks and more hard core technical facts, rather than a generalised and soft introduction to AI. I highly recommend this course. "
2019-03-11 00:00:00,Ryan J,3.0,0.0,"It was very serface level, and more focused on the teams and not the AI. It is a good first level intro to the subjects, but does not really provide future resources. which is really sad. the best improvement this could have, is a ""next steps"" or ""Start here"" for business or technology focused people. if that is added, I would up my rating to a 4/5 without it, I feel cheated."
2019-03-23 00:00:00,Hermann V,3.0,0.0,"It is a solid but very general introduction to AI. Personally, I would have enjoyed a bit more content, but of course this is not the goal of this course, so I might be a bit unfair here. Also, it focuses very much on business applications of AI. If you are a Manager or CEO with no understanding of AI, this is an excellent introduction.  "
2019-09-04 00:00:00,Kyle M,3.0,0.0,"It is incredibly broad in scope, almost to the point of being not really helpful. Also, there's a lot of Andrew's politics and ""California-bias"" baked into this course. Encouraging universal income and constantly harping on gender bias is really a boring and progressive-left obsessed topic."
2021-12-10 00:00:00,卓玛多杰,3.0,0.0,"In my opinion, this course is designed for newcomers of AI. If someone is more interested in advanced topics such as theory and applications, I suggest to take the Machine Learning course instructed by Andrew on coursera or Stanford open course. That is all."
2019-03-09 00:00:00,Sushant P,3.0,0.0,"This is a great initial attempt to roll out general awareness, bringing strategic thinking in matters relating to AI. I think this course need more of that esp, in the weeks 3rd and 4th. Nevertheless, appreciate the effort in bringing forth this course."
2020-06-18 00:00:00,Maryam R,3.0,0.0,"The course is not technical, it is a general description of the AI world, particularly targeting the business industries.... However the instructor is good and tries really hard to explain the concepts."
2019-06-03 00:00:00,Emmanuel N Q E,3.0,0.0,"This course is good, but without the quizzes, its pretty difficult to know whether you've learnt it right, which can hamper learning. Hopefully they can unlock the quizzes like other courses."
2020-03-23 00:00:00,Erik J J D B,3.0,0.0,The course is a good introduction to AI. What it can do an not do. Sometimes it is too general and could have some more depth to it without going into all the technical or software details.
2022-07-21 00:00:00,Taqwa K,3.0,0.0,This course is very knownledgebale. The Teacher has explained all the aspects very well. The Slides were accommodating. But the teacher should make his voice  clear and loud
