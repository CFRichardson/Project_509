2019-08-22,GANGIREDDY K K R,5.0,100.0,"This course is simply awesome. If you really want to learn something worthy, then this course is for you. It has no answers anywhere to copy, so we have to work hard on it and practice the material."
2017-12-01,Cornelia R,2.0,83.0,"I have working experience with Excel for many years and am a Mac user. I signed up for this to get more tips and a refresher on how to best use Excel. I initially learned using Excel in Windows, have been a Mac user for years. Most excel sheets I worked on would be revenue forecasts, pipeline etc.
This course hasn't been great so far for a Mac user. I constantly have to stop and double check if this course actually mentioned the right short cuts (the UI is on Windows, they mention Mac shortcuts). For example, in Lesson one I tried to find Flash Fill for ages - turns out, there's no Flash Fill available on Mac. Very poor for a course. You should offer to separate ones - one for Windows, one for Mac. Same in final exam in Lesson one: I answered correctly for Mac which was a wrong answer for Windows. 
I wouldn't recommend this if you are a Mac user. "

2018-03-19,Manu G,5.0,46.0,A great course for beginners in MS Excel. Introduces one to the various functionalities that Excel has to offer. Course content and structure are excellent and helps one to learn at an optimal rate.
2020-06-29,Kamrul S,5.0,44.0,This is an amazing course for learners. I am having a lot of fun completing this course from the starting point. It is very much enjoyable and the way the course teachers deliver every lecture superb.
2019-08-29,Robert B,5.0,42.0,The course was defiantly more than I expected. It not only strengthened what I did know about Excel but it showed me several options that I was not using or haven't found. I would highly recommend it.
2020-06-09,Keshav G,5.0,40.0,Very good teaching of fundamentals. Everything was explained in a really structured manner. Final assessment was like cherry on the cake as it helped in revisiting what has been taught over the weeks. 
2020-05-05,Vistasp E,5.0,33.0,"An excellent course for anyone wanting to learn excel. I promise you that you shall learn something even if it's a basic operation like copy and paste. Well explained, and properly structured course."
2018-02-24,Alexander J V,5.0,31.0,This course demonstrated a solid overview of the core skills necessary to use Excel productively. I would recommend it to anyone looking to start using Excel effectively for data management tasks.
2020-11-11,Valeria J,5.0,23.0,With this course you learn how to use Excel in your daily life. I recommend it to everyone that starts using excel and the ones that want to become better in understanding how it works and be quicker. 
2020-06-08,Drashtant K ,5.0,23.0,Amazingly crafted course with interactive sessions that pushes you to work things out and practice. Practice makes permanent at all costs. Must do course for getting to know the basic stuff in excel.
2019-06-01,Sayid N,5.0,22.0,"this course is amazing, the way of teaching, step by step, no complicated information at once, great knowledge for the learner different backgrounds. it suits me very well. Like it."
2018-07-28,Syed Z H,3.0,20.0,Focus too much towards windows it was hard for me to do it on Mac.
2019-05-05,Anthony G,5.0,19.0,"I have no experience at all with Excel but after this wonderful course, i was able to pick it up pretty quickly! No more being intimated by being asked to have excel experience on job applications!"
2020-04-28,Harshul B,5.0,16.0,"Amazing course,
I would like to highlight some of its amazing attributes:
>> Learning from the basic to advanced  level : 
The course takes you on an adventurous voyage from basic tools to advanced and  In-depth knowledge of each tool.
>> Quiz after each videos : 
The best practice to test your knowledge is to take a quiz. Each quiz is a combination of  task and MCQ with not a boring or dull direct questions but in fact, are loaded with fun and application knowledge-based questions 
>> Assignments  : 
After each week progress, an assignment is provided to practice which is the best way to explore and apply knowledge gained in the module. They are based on continuous practice and reflection of knowledge .

2021-02-09,Daniel T,5.0,14.0,"Really well done!    You kept me interested and motivated, and that's not easy to do!   
I enjoyed the balance of instructional videos and hands-on exercises, and I'm excited to try the Intermediate now."
2019-12-19,Ravindra S R,5.0,14.0,"It's a very helpful course for me as I got to know how much I learned via my work experience and what all other things I need to learn to improve my excel skills. 
Content and syllabus is amazing."
2018-01-05,Ferdinand L P,5.0,11.0,"Excellent course for either refreshing Excel basics or for Excel novices. The course is well-organized, well-paced, has clear and too-the-point videos and additional material. There are good exercises to do before the assessments each week and before the final assessment. As a regular Excel user, I enjoyed the extra Ninja tips and learnt new things by knowing more short-cuts so as to work more efficiently. The course presents only the basics so you need to do the follow-up course before becoming a Excel Jedi. 
The only ""dark side"" comes from Microsoft which does not give full functionality to the Office for Mac users and this is also affecting the use of Excel. 
The course focuses primarily on Windows users, though compared to other Excel courses (on EdX), in this course the Excel Jedi lecturers are providing also suggestions how the various Excel functions etc. work or work differently or do nit work  in a Mac environment. The forum provides also tips from other students. "
2019-01-02,Mahdi K S,5.0,10.0,"I would like to thank the teachers at Macquarie University for this course. The modules are logically structured, and the explanations are quite detail-oriented with enough examples and practice files, making it possible for the learner to do what one of the instructors, Prashan often says during the course: ""practice makes permanent"". I have never had a formal course in Excel usage and this course is helping me fill major gaps in my knowledge. This is recommended for all in business and academia, since Excel is one of the major tools used in the world today. We are constantly bombarded by the need to understand AI, Machine Learning and IoT, but the first thing we must to do, is simply to be able to make a flawless spreadsheet on Excel. "
2019-10-25,Evteev D A,5.0,10.0,"This is my favorite course of all that I took at Coursera. Very convenient presentation of the material, especially for people who are not easily given work in software. Despite the fact that this is the first part of four in this specialization, it gives a lot of skills to carry out many office projects. I already ordered the rest. Thank you, you inspired me to start a career in a new direction."
2019-02-22,Javid S,5.0,10.0,"  I advise anyone who wants to learn Excel to get this course, it has been useful for me, thanks to all instructors.  "
2019-08-03,Daniel P,3.0,10.0,"Fairly good, but still has some weak points as follows: 
file archive are inconsistent (1st two weeks has sub-folders for OSX and PC) but from third sub-folder is only for OSX and rest are in root of archive, which denotes a lack of attention to details.
all files to be downloaded are scattered through archive and additional multiple files to download after (feels inconsistent)
formatting instructions are US centrist and totally ignores other country settings (in Europe for example we use comma as decimal separator and dot for thousand separator, therefore provided within question phrase format is being interpreted by Excel as thousand separator w/o decimal, whereas if US setting would be present no thousand separator and 2 decimals is given), so clearer international safe instructions should be included

Other than this was quite good coverage of basic to medium functionalities."
2019-09-24,Mohammad H,5.0,9.0,"I highly recommend this course to anybody needing to learn Excel from scratch or even if you're experienced with it but want to brush up your skills. The format is great! There are mini goal-oriented videos to watch and exercise tasks to follow along with, then there are quizzes to take as well as Excel sheets to work with to test and check if you've actually obtained the knowledge. It's not just, ""do this, follow along, yay, next lesson."" It's, okay, you've followed along, now try this exercise on your own and here's the result you should get if you do it right. If you watch all of the videos, do the exercises, take the quizzes, and even read the ninja tips and read the supplemental articles, I honestly feel like you'll develop a wonderful foundation to build up off of in Excel. I'm super excited that I took this course and cannot wait to follow up and check out the subsequent courses. Best of luck guys, I highly recommend this course!"
2018-12-03,Dana,5.0,9.0,"This is an amazing Excel Course. Both teachers are pretty excellent. They Excel course is easy to understand. It is designed for beginners. I would suggest it to students of any age. I will consider recommend it to my parents or grandparents that find technology and any computer software difficult to deal with. I like how the teachers introduce Sean as a case for this course. I felt like Sean every week and as this invisible character was learning so was I.  This course has quizzes and challenges which I enjoyed and as the teacher always tell us  ""Practice makes Permanent"" . I will continue practicing everything i have learned here. Thank you very much Coursera and thanks for my two beloved teachers of this course. Needless to say, both teachers through the videos express support , understanding and love. Thank you"
2018-02-08,Divya G,5.0,9.0,"A very well detailed and well explained course for those who have no experience in working with Excel. The instructors Prashan and Nicky has done an awesome job. The quiz and assignments are well structured to test your understanding of the subject and add to your knowledge base. Would recommend this course to those too who are well versed with Excel as there is always something new to learn. The video and sound quality is very good. Course is well paced and not too fast, gives enough time to understand the concepts and apply them. The attached workbooks with each video are of great help to practice what you are learning. Don't forget - Practice makes permanent. To all those who have completed this course - #EveryoneSayWow."
2019-06-23 00:00:00,Lauren A,5.0,8.0,Very comprehensive. Taught in a friendly and easy way. I was sure I retained skills with the final exam.
2019-02-17 00:00:00,Anthony R,5.0,5.0,"This course provides a good foundation of skills for Excel, additionally it can fill in a few gaps in your knowledge if you're a self taught Excel user already. "

2019-02-18 00:00:00,Ali A T,4.0,3.0,I had really good time doing this course. This was the first time i was doing any online course and i found this course very interesting and easy to work with. The animation and videos were very helpful.
2020-06-04 00:00:00,Claire C,3.0,3.0,There are a lot of gaps between what is instructed in the videos and what is asked in the tests
2020-05-09 00:00:00,Kayla H,1.0,3.0,"I think the questions are really confusing, some of the questions are actually wrong, that you can't find the right answer, i.e. instructing you to change the data for Cindy, then asks for the final income for Tom. And their excel files seem not compatible with Mac (?) I have to restarted 2 of the files for 5 times. Also, someone has also pointed out, the questions/ shortcuts are not for Mac"
2020-08-05 00:00:00,Nguyen N T G,5.0,2.0,"I am familiar with using Excel, however, I want to take the Specialization module, and I have to finish this Essentials course first. So this is a review from an intermediate Excel user.
1) After taking the course, I actually know more tips to use Excel faster.
2) The lecture videos are very informative and easy to follow. I always put a 1.75x speed on :) (Not sure whether the lecturer was too slow or I were too fast). And they also have subtitles. If English is not your native language, or your listening skill is not advanced, you can watch the subtitles while following the lectures.
3) This course is easy to me. Once again, it only delivers the basics, and for beginners. 
4) The course provides you with all the materials needed, and a summary of short-cuts and lectures in a week. 
5) I can finish this course in 2 days. 
So I hope that it could be more challenging. To sum up, it is a nice experience :)"
2021-07-01 00:00:00,Sudhan P,5.0,2.0,"I've been using MS Excel for the past two years, and as said in the beginning by the course instructors, I found many gaps in my Excel skills.
I was literally stunned by the course delivery and its content. I never expected that they would provide workbooks to assist us while practicing.
Think how hard it would be to create your own set of data and then practice in the initial stages?
It'd be hectic.
The workbooks provided by them were of great help to me.
And a special mention to those Practice Challenges. I'd surely recommend all learners to make utmost use of those challenges and quizzes."
2021-02-05 00:00:00,Isaac C C,5.0,2.0,Muy buen curso. Me sorprendió particularmente su completitud. Me considero un usuario intermedio en Excel y considero haber aprendido muchas más cosas de las que esperaba. Me motivó a seguir con los cursos intermedios y avanzado que ofrece el programa.
2019-06-16 00:00:00,Théophile F,5.0,2.0,"Great course, but only for those that Don't have any skills and experience with Excel, it might be a little to easy for those who have already worked with it.

2019-11-06 00:00:00,Pavel G,5.0,2.0,"Хороший курс. Может быть местами чуть занудный, но пятерка - честная."
2020-05-02 00:00:00,Pvsr S,3.0,2.0,"I found this course pretty awesome .. but for a person who is already working with excel for quite sometime  this course would just be a refresher of all known concepts and shortcuts and nothing new t learn.
If you are a total beginner then this would be the best course to start learning excel.

Disclaimer : Came to know  from my friends and peers that this course is not fetching good results when took from MAC as the shortcuts and other stuff is not mentioned right. So best recommended for Windows Users"
2020-07-06 00:00:00,Himalaya K S,2.0,2.0,"I have worked in Excel for years. Signed up for basic tips and overall Specialization certification. Although its purpose is to go through the essentials of Excel, some important topics were rushed through. And practice challenges do not seem to be enough for beginners. Some questions were confusing and lots of gaps between the lecture and the questions asked in the quiz. Feedbacks could also be more constructive to guide the students to learn the concept instead of the need to resort to trial and error methods to pass the test with no learning of the targeted concept.
For the basics, I would recommend freely available resources on youtube which has great content and excellent practice materials for the proper application of the material in various scenarios. The only downside is you do not earn a certificate."
2020-04-28 00:00:00,PRAISE T,1.0,2.0,"Excel you can learn through practice
You cant just study excel by doing some excise in the worksheet provided by the tutor
When you really stuck for excel in office please search that doubt in google and find out
dont waste time by doing this kind of course in excel
the course is too long and boring
please dont opt for this course if you wants to save your time...............
Course content really good..........."
2020-09-03 00:00:00,Zokir R,5.0,1.0,"Coursera is the best way to learn online. I like how I can access courses that are held in real universities around the world. The course material was easy to follow along with the instructor. I am very grateful to Nicky Bull, Dr Prashan, A / Professor Yvonne Breyer instructors from Macquarie University.
I am 55 years old and my profession is a school teacher. It is easy for me to solve other complex examples from mathematics integral, trigonometric equations, and the like. There were no computers in schools at that time. We didn't know about Excel, Word, Programming languages, Pascal, Basic and so on. When I was in university, I was interested in programming mathematical examples in the Fortran programming language. As a talented student, I was invited to study at Moscow and St. Petersburg universities. Because of my family circumstances, I turned down an offer to study at such prestigious universities. Now there are great opportunities for young people. Talented students at our school want to study at Coursera. But some found it difficult to master. To understand the reason, I also started studying and got a certificate. It was a little difficult at first. Because I have a good understanding of mathematics, I made sure to translate the questions in English into Uzbek with a 100% guarantee. They understand English well, but do not understand sentences involving scientific terms. That is, even an expert who can speak English well will misinterpret sentences involving a scientific term. So I understood them. I can create complex algorithms in older programming languages. Now I think I should be able to easily learn modern Python programming language in the courseera and then I will take the next Excel course. It’s a lot of fun for me to compete with young people.
I just wanted to thank again all the people who have been working so hard to deliver great courses on Coursera."
2019-02-04 00:00:00,Shelly-Ann J,5.0,1.0,"For the most part I am self-taught Excel user.  I was formally trained to use SPSS and ArcGIS while in university, but not Excel.  I began using Excel for ease of use purposes, especially when sharing output with persons who did not have SPSS or ArcGIS.  Excel eventually became the primary program I use and at work I am considered one of the more advanced users.  However, I was very much aware there were gaps in my knowledge.  This course has effectively gone about answering that.  It is an ideal course for the self taught heavy Excel user.  I highly recommend doing the course.  The material is easy to understand, an easy read and the tests are good practice,"
2018-03-14 00:00:00,Smiljana S,5.0,1.0,"I am very happy with the quality of the course.
The lecturers were very friendly, easy to understand, and got their points across about different Excel related things very clearly.
The subjects covered were very well suited for the beginner level, and the practice challenges and assessments just enough challenging to not allow the learners become complacent.
I found the course very useful although I had some basic knowledge of Excel before because I had a lot of holes in what I previously learned, and therefore my previous knowledge was incomplete and not well structured.
I will definitely be taking the intermediate course as well! 
Thank you very much!"
2020-05-22 00:00:00,Sabrina K S,5.0,1.0,"As a Mac user on Excel 2019, I found this course to be exceptionally well taught as well as relevant to the newer excel version (and of course mac). The instructors are easy to listen to and lessons are broken down into small chunks. The on-screen keyboard tips specific to Mac helped a lot, though there will be times when you need to look up alternatives e.g. my mac doesn't have function keys 1-12 so I needed to use different shortcuts. I would highly recommend this course for someone completely new to excel."

2019-08-16 00:00:00,Andrés T R,4.0,1.0,"It's a very good course if you are looking for some introductory content to start using Excel and know how to do lots of different things which are really helpful in almost every aspect of your life. For me it was easy because I had previous knowledge about this software, nevertheless I learnt a few new things such as the ""absolute cell referencing"", or taking data from another sheet of the workbook. Now, thanks to this course, I have improved at Excel and I feel confident to use it at my work on a daily basis."
2021-08-03 00:00:00,Quyen B,4.0,1.0,"I would give it a 4.5 star rating. The only issue I have with the course is when it comes to your quizzes and/or final exam, the feedback on incorrect answers is lacking. There is not much help in trying to correct your mistakes.
Other than that, the course is laid out and explained in great detail. A little cheesy with how over the top the explanations are, but it provides a good laugh. 
I appreciate how much more proficient I am with Excel in such a short period of time. On to the next level of the course!"
2021-01-09 00:00:00,Martin K,4.0,1.0,"I enjoyed it and I highly recommended, It is just very basic knowledge of Excel, BUT you can't finish it without this course. Excel has many  important little nooks and this course is like the light in the darkness of your understanding and you will see more clearly in this Excel's world. :)"
2021-04-11 00:00:00,Abdullah B F B J,4.0,1.0,"Solid course for excel but I did not like the fact that there is a quiz after each practice videos , the final assessment in week 6 was a little bit hard cuz it does not tell you which formula to use and this course did not explained all types of formulas  "
2019-06-22 00:00:00,Nelson R,4.0,1.0,Definitely would recommend to my younger self to take this course early on in my career. Vey basic and excellently structured. Both Nicky and Prashan did a great job! Thank you.
2020-05-21 00:00:00,Michael H,4.0,1.0,This class was very challenging.  I learned a lot but had some issues with the wording of some test questions.  I am looking forward to the next course.
2019-06-25 00:00:00,Evert O,4.0,1.0,Excellent course to be more productive (i.e. faster) in Excel. 
2020-08-23 00:00:00,James J,3.0,1.0,"I found the course content really valuable.
But these courses are for windows users and should only be marketed as such. 
I use a MacBook Pro and although it nodded toward the fact that you may have to hunt for particular tools, sometimes those tools just did not exist and then it came up on the assessment. 
They should re-do the videos with content aimed at Mac users too not just windows.
If I'd have been using a windows computer then I would have found the video tutorials really easy to follow - as it was I struggled far more than I should have had to considering I'm paying for this."
2020-12-19 00:00:00,"Rosenberry, A",3.0,1.0,Very challenging to complete on a Mac laptop!  Great course materials but would be so much better if tailored to the computer in use.

2020-12-08 00:00:00,MacGregor O,2.0,1.0,Good for a basic walkthrough of Microsoft Excel. Weak on data manipulation and visualization. No work on functions or look ups. Printing does not need its own course section at this point where reports are not frequently being printed

2020-09-13 00:00:00,Jillian V,1.0,1.0,In 7 minutes the teacher covers about 5 key elements. There is no pause for you to try. I'm aware you can hit pause at any time. This course feels very centered around vocabulary rather than the topic being hands-on. To top it off the teacher talks so fast. Try a different class or Youtube.

2021-05-03 00:00:00,Jin H T,5.0,0.0,"I highly recommend people to take the course and learn about Microsoft Excel. I devoted days to complete the course and I am very happy and proud of myself that I have learned more about the software. Throughout the course, I am amazed by what I discovered from Microsoft Excel and how incredible and powerful it is. This happens while I am watching the videos and also using Microsoft Excel on my computer to follow what they did and also when I practised myself and doing tests and assessments. I like the exercises which are rigorous and ensures that learners internalise and apply what they have learned and have a firm grasp of what is taught in the course. The quizzes and assessments can be challenging but making mistakes are how we learn. I think the only slightly annoying thing is that the course is more towards Microsoft Windows users rather than Apple Mac users and I was a Mac user. I was able to figure out the shortcuts anyway. I feel motivated to carry on my learning to the next level such as going on to the intermediate level. Microsoft Excel is an essential, important and critical skill as well live with digital technologies and in a data-driven world. One would feel a sense of accomplishment such as being able to create charts. "
2021-09-02 00:00:00,Frances A,5.0,0.0,"Thanks #Coursera and #MacquarieUniversity! The best Excel course EVER...  The instructors go slow so you don't miss a thing, the Challenges only reinforce what you learn in the videos, and the small quizzes after each video drove home what you just learned. Repetitiveness is key here- it can be quite easy to forget even the smallest of functions, so keep practicing and practicing! Excel was about the only thing missing from my resume until now. I tried many times over the years to learn- but to no avail. Finally a course so good- I completed my first final exam with a 96.66%! HOLY CROW! This Excel course is by far the most superior I have come across. Bonus: each video is no longer than about five minutes long (no long boring lectures or Power Point Presentations, AND the Toolbox feature is a must!). The Toolbox feature has excellent tips and provides all the Terminology you need to succeed- I personally copied it all down for my own personal records. Also, Ninja Tips. Cool beans.
This course, the instructors, and the way the courses are so well organized, turned this Excel skeptic, into a believer! I'm already excited to start course #2! "
2020-09-20 00:00:00,Kathleen S,5.0,0.0,"This course was GREAT, I am so pleased in the information and the manner in which it was taught.  I actually completed it and understood what I learned but was so upset with myself being the one question I missed was because when I selected my formatting for currency I inadvertently selected the one with a comma in it and it was very clearly stated what the format should be.  I had the answer correct but that one dumb mistake.  What I took away from that mistake however is the importance of ensuring that what you do in Excel carries over and if you are not careful your information can be  altered with one slip of the finger.  Do I regret my error of course I am a perfectionist, however I took away a lesson with it so it was a valuable mistake.  The instructors were very knowledgably and I feel what I needed to obtain from this class was received.  I thank you for the opportunity and  look forward to taking additional courses on line when I am employed.  I would highly refer this process of learning to my friends, family and co-workers."
2020-05-28 00:00:00,Mr H P,5.0,0.0,"  This is a very well organized, excellently presented, top quality course. I highly recommend it. I already know some Excel and regularly use Power Query to query Oracle and SQL Server databases and generate pivot tables. Yet I learned many new things from auditing just week 1 of the course. I love the pace. There is a short video and then a graded quiz, then more videos and more quizzes. The quizzes sometimes covered material that was not in the videos. I suppose this is intentional to make the students learn to find things out themselves. I downloaded the exercises as Excel workbooks. The exercises are very well thought out. I thought the instructors would have Australian accent and I would have problem understanding them. I was wrong. They spoke perfect American English with no accent. Coursera would not grade the quiz at the end of the week unless I pay to upgrade, but this does not bother me because I can check my own work. I look forward to finishing the course and taking the other courses in the series.  "
2021-09-26 00:00:00,Hugo E V,5.0,0.0,"Great Course! The first time I had contact with Excel, it was with Windows 3.11. I studied Excel in a wide book. It was hard to learn in it, ,but I got the basics. The second time I studied Excel was with Excel 98, The books improved a lot. There were very colorful pictures and practical knowledge. The third time I studied Excel was with Excel 2006. There I could see that the interface changed a lot, and I began having trouble with it, ,but I passed the course. This is the fourth time I studied Excel, and I love the way you planned the course. That conversation format between the instructors is very cool! I really feel more comfortable using Excel now. I must share with you, that before this course I remembered that Excel could do many things, ,but I spent a lot of time trying to find the right tool. In many cases, I could not repeat the procedure that I used in previous versions, because Excel has improved a lot. I  thank you very much! This was a great course! "
2020-05-07 00:00:00,Mr C D B,5.0,0.0,"I would class myself as quite a competent Excel user, but (as most probably like most!), all self taught with little or no 'formal' qualifications.  So I wanted to follow a specialization route to gain these 'approved competencies).  Having followed other online training before, I can honestly say that the presentation both in terms of delivery and content is as good as I've ever seen.  Really well constructed, with a plan and focus to take you from week 1 to week 6.  Great structure that builds upon the previous weeks knowledge  and also contains detailed examples with enough data content that allows you to 'play' around and practice.  It delivers on it's essentials tagline, as the topics are relevant and focused to provide a great base to 'overcome' any fears of using Excel, so that you can build upon good knowledge in the workplace.
From start to finish one of the best online courses that i've ever seen and participated in."
2020-12-16 00:00:00,Rudolph G,5.0,0.0,"This was a very good online course! In many online courses, it seems that several steps are avoided by the designers and teachers of the course, but not here, at least, not for the most part. I was very impressed by the direct communication from the two teachers to the online students for each week's topical presentation. They made an excellent effort to communicate with students, to spend significant time and effort to explain the concepts and methods related to Excel at the essentials level. I appreciated very much both Nicky and Prashan's enthusiastic and warm, genuine interest in our needs and abilities to learn and understand the materials of the course. I truly felt supported in my progress through this six-week essentials course, and I look forward very much to signing up for the second course in the four course-sequence. "
2020-06-12 00:00:00,Deep S,5.0,0.0,"One of the best courses on Coursera. The syllabus is so perfectly designed.I thought i knew the basics of Excel but only once when you undergo formal training you know that there's lot in Excel which I never thought about. I came to know about this in the beginner's course only, then just think about the rich high-quality content in the other courses in this specialization. The teachers are fantastic. The instructor for this course is only Nicky Bull Mam but Yvonne Breyer Mam and Prashan Karunarate Sir will also teach in further courses in this specialization. All three are excellent above-par teachers and leave no scope for doubts. Do take the practice challenge and quizzes because much extra-information is given there. Excel is all about practice and exploring. Prashan Sir will make sure to get this into our heads. "
2020-08-25 00:00:00,Dharmendra S,5.0,0.0,Really learned quite a bit about Excel and while learning I enjoyed it. For that credit goest to both the instructors who are excellent and made a bit difficult topic easy to understand. So perfect score for them. Also course is well structured and modules are good mix of text and video lessons and practical exercises.  One suggestion I would really want to share that while on such platform 'Forum' works well but for one's queries he/she might have to wait endlessly. So there should be some mechanism to resolve one's query/problem. For that matter if some very good answers by participants/moderators are readily availabe say 2 years back than that response should appear against that query. It should not go unanswered. But overall a good begining into the world of spreadsheets!   
2020-07-13 00:00:00,Ahadul I,5.0,0.0,"This course is, in one word, awesome! Even if you think you know Excel, you never know ;)
The course is elegantly designed. At the start of every week, the instructors sit together and explain what the learners will be coming across in the coming week. The explanations in the lectures are nice and vivid. 
All the Excel courses out there have seasoned instructors and all of them have ample knowledge to share. But what actually sets this course apart, from all the other courses, is that the exercises are comprehensive and when you complete those exercises, you are already using the tools, which you may have forgotten if you didn't go through. 
Excellent primer for any one wanting to learn Excel. It is equally good for anyone who thinks he needs some polish in his basics. "
2020-07-24 00:00:00,Abdul A H,5.0,0.0,"Very impressive, the sessions are a very good introduction to Excel skills for business! The tutors are excellent at explaining terminologies effectively and it is easy to understand. The detailed explanations throughout this course has definitely enabled me to become more proficient in using excels tools and I have learnt loads more even though I have used Excel before this course. Thank you! It is also very easy to learn and follow the tutors instructions and practice along using the videos, exercise workbooks and also practice questions. Overall, I feel encouraged to learn more and I thank everyone involved for making this course. I encourage anyone looking for an introduction to Excel or to improve core Excel skills to take this course, it is very worthwhile!"
2020-09-03 00:00:00,Larry G,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed taking this course. The curriculum was direct and to the point. The material covered in my opinion was relevant to how Excel is being used in today's company's.  The practice videos, and the quiz that followed each lesson was really helpful. Thanks  Coursera and Macquarie University for providing the course to those of us who are looking to increase their knowledge and skill level. I'm very optimistic about securing employment that requires me to utilize Excel daily and fill confident about executing the various tasks to complete effective spreadsheets/reports, charts and graphs, etc. Dare I ask  Coursera to find another resource that offers the chance to learn advance to expert level Excel Skills and knowledge. Again, thank you so much!!"
2021-10-18 00:00:00,Natalie M,5.0,0.0,"I​ genuinely thought I was beyond this course because I'd used Excel in college, but discovered so many shortcuts and a few little tricks I didn't know. This is a great course to start with as a refresher, but also just to get a feel for how the specialization courses go for this Excel specialization. The flow of the course is logical, well-planned, and builds without spending too much time on the easiest bits and also without excluding them. It's ideal for the beginner or intermediate user...if you can open Excel, you can take this course. If you have been regularly using Excel with a few basic functions but the idea of manipulating data seems intimidating, this course is still extremely helpful. Great course!"
2020-11-17 00:00:00,Helaine D,5.0,0.0,"Overall, this was a great course and I built up a solid knowledge of Excel. (Prior to this course, I used Excel quite a bit, but I was self-taught on the job, so there were a lot of holes.) 
I did have just a little bit of trouble as a Mac user. Most of the time, there were good instructions for Mac, but on occasion, the instructions weren't correct. (In those cases, I had to do my own research to uncover the correct method on Mac.) Also, on rare occasions, there are procedures in Excel that simply don't work on Mac at all, and that was a little frustrating. I spent a lot of time researching online to only find that those procedures simply won't work at all. 
Again, happy overall. Thanks for a great course!"
2021-02-13 00:00:00,Georg D,5.0,0.0,"I like this course big time - the style of the presenters, that they speak standard English, the tests really help to ensure the candidate has understood Excel but also uses the brain to identify the right answer. The quizzes are geat as they give you hints on common errors that people make and if you repeat it, you get different questions. So it is really about learning the stuff, not memorizing the right answer.
I was using Excel 365 on a Mac in another language than English. This can be hard as the menus, functions, keywords are obviousley different. Also Excel365 on MacOS reacts at time differently than on Windows. Overall great that they referenced the differences between MacOS and Windows versions."

The course has the ability to meet all the needs of novices and also freshers. Excel skills for business course has provided all desired stuffs which I looking for.The presentations are very nice and easy to understand. This is a very nice and effective way to work on learned elements in excel through practice quizzes. At the end of every module self test for getting grade is very worthy for ascertainment of our actual position after practicing throughout the week.I personally have been very benefited from this course.Needless to say , I highly recommend this course to complete successfully."
2020-08-22 00:00:00,Justin R,5.0,0.0,"This course was very well understandable and helped me brush up on my knowledge of Excel from grade school in the 90s. I've had to use Excel at different times at work and it always took forever for me to figure out charts, filtering, sorting, hiding and unhiding, etc. Now, I feel much more confident and quick. Plus, I learned so many new tools in such a short period of time. The course was so entertaining that it was always hard to say enough for today! Nicky and Prashan did a great job and are a great team! The quizes were difficult enough to make you have to think, but not too difficult if you work through the exercises. Thank you very much! I'm looking forward to the next course already!"
2020-05-06 00:00:00,Kartikeya D,5.0,0.0,"FANTASTIC course! This course has given me the skills which will be useful in my career in management. The course is designed in a perfect manner : right from the basics with increasing difficulty. But, the instructor did a brilliant job by teaching in a lucid and friendly manner. The course contents and especially the workbooks were very instrumental in the learning process. Practice assignments were very good. And last but not the least, the final course assignment was a tough nut as it used every skill that is learnt throughout the course duration. I would love to re-visit this course again to brush up my newly learned basic skills in Excel. Thanks Coursera and Macquerie University!"

I have been using Excel from the past 10 years or so, but it was just that I wasn't  utilizing the full potential of this very powerful tool !!

All thanks to the superb and very knowledgeable Instructors Nicky Bull, Prashan Karunaratne from Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia & Coursera for such a wonderful course ! I have made hand-written notes of about 15 pages to remember the invaluable knowledge & skills which I have learnt. Now I can say that '""Practice Makes Permanent !!"" :-)"

Since I am a beginner to Excel without having any prior experience in Excel, I signed for this course and followed the course, its workbooks and its quiz. Initially I felt it is difficult to pass, but the instructing videos pulled me back to enhance my interest. It really taught me from scratch to finally become a professional. Initially I was bit hesitant to take up Final Assessment Quiz, which had 22 questions, but I took my time and passed the final assessment in my very first attempt. 
Thank you very much Prashan and the lady coordinator. You took away all my fears working in Excel. My heartfelt thanks to you both."

In general, the videos were excellent and clear.

The shooting of the videos on some worksheets goes at an angle. I think it's better to keep the view straight on, with highlight of the focus area.

I liked the simplicity and easiness in presenting the topics and concepts.
I didn't participate in the discussion forum, but I noticed that there are many threads with request for help, and there are no comments from the instructors! May be they should participate more!

The assignments could have been designed in an interactive way using Macros! 

I have done another basic course on Excel before, and Macros were used. It was really good!"

I felt the pace was right, the content was right, and the challenge was good. I look forward to more courses with Macquarie University. Now if I can just find where to print my certificate..."

Pros
This course is easy to understand, whether you know how to use excel or not . This course have small tests after each class which usually takes around a 1 or so. There are also practice assessment which will help to test your knowledge .
Cons
Slightly difficult final assignment and that is all.
I am not very good writer and I can't express all my gratitude for this course but for those who still hesitates whether or not take this course .Absolutely, yes  !!!

The assignments and quizzes were at an appropriate difficulty level and well constructed. The presenters were good and made the content accessible. I took the ""every Day"" Excel course fist, but I wished I had taken this course first; Every Day Excel was faster and harder, and I wasn't able to digest and retain everything. I recommend people take Excel Skills for Business first and Every Day Excel second. I want to also take more courses from these presenters and from this school because they are good. "

Although my knowledge for this material came from using excel in every day work and learn by doing required tasks, it was great to learn in this professional presented videos and exercises, Besides I have learned new things that was missing from my day to day usage.
I recommend any one thinking of learning excel skills to attend this course weather he or she is a new user or a professional.

For a person who feared Excel for his entire life, I can assure you that by the end of the course, you will not only overcome your fears but will have a solid understanding of the concepts and have made far greater progress than learning excel online because the worksheets, tutorials, assessments are designed in a way to tackle challenges and that too at your own pace.

I'm going to go over sorting, filtering and conditional formatting before I go on to the new class, but I was quite pleased with how much I learned and retained overall.

I work for one organisation but in multiple locations. This course helped me put all my hours in one timesheet and from there generate multiple timesheets specific for each site.

I am Sanika Angal from India. I am perusing my MBA degree in Banking And Financial Services specialization from one of the renowned university in Pune. I would love to share that, this course has helped me to work on excel more confidently now. After attending 6 weeks of lectures, I have learnt very minute things in Excel and I am sure that this will help me to make my use of Excel skills in organization when I will be joining. I am thankful to you for having this online platform as it helps each and everyone to build themselves in a better way. 
Thankyou. And Have A NIce Day.  "
2018-01-28 00:00:00,Sukumaran ,5.0,0.0,"Though I have been using Excel for over 15 years in my career, the Excel Skills course  has been exceptional.  It has helped me to use the inbuilt tools and shortcuts in a much simpler and efficient manner.  Ever since I have started applying my learning at work, things are looking significantly better.  It has pushed my confidence level higher as I am able to accomplish excel related tasks faster and better.  Kudos to the University, the course ware is brilliantly structured with videos, practice sessions and forums in the right order and the quality of content is top notch.  Sukumaran P"
2022-01-07 00:00:00,Navjot K N,5.0,0.0,THE BEST COURSE EVER!!!!!! I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO FIND A VIDEO THAT CAN TEACH ME EXCEL IN A DECENT WAY WITH GOOD SPEED AND PRACTICE BUT NEVER FOUND IT. WHEN I ENROLLED IN COURSERA COURSE FOR EXCEL IT GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN IN THE BEST WAY AND I MEAN IT. THE METHODS USED IN THE COURSE ARE FANTASTIC AND THE PRACTICE TESTS AFTER EVERY VIDEO IS VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO LEARN ANYTHING IN AN EASY WAY. THE INSTRUCTOR ARE VERY NICE AND PROFESSIONAL. I LOVE THE COURSE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEARN EXDEL FROM THE BEGINNIGN OR WHO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ALREADY. 
2020-06-18 00:00:00,Nicholas T,5.0,0.0,"The pace and articulation standards of explanation, and the sequential steps and video-narrative flow cohered well, making it easy to follow and understand the various lessons. The constant, consistent reminders to practice were also on-point. The practice exercises and assessment were also of a sufficient level to challenge, practice and learn by action. As an experienced basic Excel user woefully out of practice with the more recent versions of Excel, I think this is an excellent course for all beginners and basic users - one of the best I've taken across a few online platforms, "
2018-12-23 00:00:00,Melissa L,5.0,0.0,"I found this course to be extremely informative.  The way the coursed is taught, the interactive challenges, quizzes and test are extremely useful and straight forward.  They aid in reinforcing the information which is taught.  It had been about 20 years since I took and excel course and there have been many more versions since I originally encountered excel; and since that point most of my knowledge was self taught.  I have walked away feeling more confident and knowledgeable on a basic excel level.  I would highly recommend both this course and Macquarie University. Thank you! "
2019-02-06 00:00:00,Mita M,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course. I signed up for a similar course in a community college (not knowing Coursera was offering it too, should have checked) but the quality of this course is significantly better. I learned more here. The data files are very helpful and both Nicky and Prashant make the learning experience very interesting. The final assessment test was challenging towards the end. I have already signed up for the Intermediate I session and I am loving it. It is challenging to say the least right from Week 1. I wish more such courses were offered for MS Word and MS PowerPoint. "
2021-04-19 00:00:00,Rajesh K,5.0,0.0,"It was more than what I was expecting as the course suggests, There are numerous skills and point which we use in excel on daily basis, and don't know the real term. We often don't get our answers from google, because we don't even know the real term, or what exactly we are doing wrong, or what term we can use while searching for the solution, This course on the other hand takes your excel basic knowledge to a whole new level. I strongly recommend it to Everyone. No matter how long you've been using excel. you must give it a try. A truly practical experience-based course. "
2021-07-19 00:00:00,Sandy 9,5.0,0.0,"Makes quality education available for anyone anywhere. Offers financial aid for students from low income countries. Every application is evaluated individually. One can download the course content and continue studying also in areas without internet access. Video lectures contain subtitles, the final assignments do not cause pressure on the student. You can resubmit as many times as you need. Video lectures play even while the phone is in standby mode, that saves the battery. Most of all, through the discussion forum you can meet new course mates from all over the world.

2021-02-18 00:00:00,Sandy K,5.0,0.0,"  Hello, thanks to the whole team. Your videos are really great, the representations, explanations, etc. What I would also like to emphasize is that it is spoken in clear and understandable English, which was very helpful for me as a non-native speaker. The fact that what is spoken can also be read in writing as text and even translated into various languages has often been helpful. I will also do another Excel course, but first I will internalize it and practice a little more.  I really recommend everybody to join your lessons. Have a good time and stay healthy. Sandy"
2020-12-02 00:00:00,Antonio A R J,5.0,0.0,"I think this is an excellent course to learn the basics of Excel with the best set of activities and work to improve your abilities with this spreadsheet table software. I'm fully convinced that practice makes a master in whatever area or software you are building skills in. So keep going, try to achieve the best and highest practical knowledge with the next courses, and improve your work time by managing shortcuts and automation processes. Take the next two courses to inquire with Excel SQL data and VBA for macros and next level functions that Excel could offer you.  "
2018-02-05 00:00:00,Valérie M,5.0,0.0,"This is the first time I get excited about Excel! The two teachers have succeeded in presenting the materials in a very effective way. This dynamic pair brought the fun back in a course which, at the first glance, don't really seem quite amusing. 
I actually learnt much more than I expected with an Essentials training, and I now feel more confident with my pratice. And eager to follow the next courses of this specialization!
Tip: Don't skip the Essentials course even if you think you are not a beginner, you will still learn and re-start with a solid foundation!"
2020-12-19 00:00:00,Deleted A,5.0,0.0,"Just wow! Best course on MS Excel not just on Coursera, but on all the E-learning platforms. I never imagined one can teach how to use a software without sucking the life out of the learner. 20 on 10 for the efforts the team made while designing this course. No matter what part of the course it is (videos, practice exercises or quizzes), you will always be engaged and that surely would help in better assimilation of concepts.
Didn't know till now that Excel really has so many features to facilitate working with large chunk of data. A must do course. Loved it! "
2020-04-19 00:00:00,Ganesh B,5.0,0.0,"Although I am familiar with the basics of Excel, thanks to this course, I was able to learn some things which I wasn't familiar with (conditional formatting, charts, shortcuts etc).  I like the practical assessment tests given after each concept so we get to practice it almost instantly and then the assessment after each week which sort of summarises the week's learning. I intend to take up the next module as well. Thank you so much to McQ University, the faculty who set up this beautiful course and to Coursera for giving us a platform to learn it as well. "
2020-09-07 00:00:00,Kannappan J,5.0,0.0,Great course materials from Macquarie University with detailed video presentation. Thanks to professor Ms.Nicky and Professor Mr. Prashan for the perfect explanations of the module. Each tools and their usage has been described perfectly throughout the course. This course definitely will help me to improve my skills at work place and use my time efficiently and in an organized manner of providing accurate data. Practice quizzes after each video helps a lot and main advantage of this course is all assessment includes mostly actual worksheet workout.
2021-03-09 00:00:00,CHRISTIAN M,5.0,0.0,"I am finishing an aerospace degree and I had used Excel to make some projects at university. However, I never attended an Excel course before, so I didn't have a solid basic base of the different buttons and basic operations of Excel. Mos of the times, I just searched for them on the internet, or tried guessing how what I wanted to do could be made. With this course, I know I gained a solid background and now I feel more confident wirth Excel. No matter what your level is, if you never attended an Excel course before, it is worth to try this one!"
2022-05-06 00:00:00,JAMIL M,5.0,0.0,"A​n excellent course all around!  This is the third specialization program I have enrolled in...and by far the best.  Other coourses should use this methodogy as a model on how to properly teach a course on line.  The material is great...a perfect mix of challeging, yet enjoyable.  More importantly, the instructors know how to teach.  I cannot stress enough, just because one is an ""expert"" in their field, that does not make them inherently a good instructor.

P​lease offer other courses in different subject matters...SQL, Tableau, UX for starters."
2019-04-18 00:00:00,Aaron A,5.0,0.0,"Even though I've been using Excel since high school and throughout my first several years of working full-time, I knew very little about all the amazing features and tools. Honestly, I was intimidated by people who seemed to know Excel like the back of their hand. I didn't think I'd be able to ever learn things that I did during Course 1. Learning about printing from Excel, creating charts, and tools like Flash Fill and Freeze Pane was quite amazing and fun! I'm looking forward to continue practicing and learning to become an Excel power user!"
2022-06-21 00:00:00,Niranjan b,5.0,0.0,"The course was amazing, the way it was structured was very helpful to cope with, especially quizzes after every practise video made me hold on to whatever was taught very well, the two course professors were also very nice, and the way the course was taken did not bore me at any point, which is great.

One thing I'd like to point out is that in some quizzes, the questions were from the next topic practise video, which obviously I hadn't watched before giving the quiz, so I had to answer them by learning that concept from an external source."
2020-10-27 00:00:00,Kathy L A,5.0,0.0,"This course is very well-designed. The quality of the videos are great and the length of each video was just right for a learner's attention span. The quizzes after each video also helps in reinforcing the concepts learned. The practice challenges are great and the instructions are well-written. The teachers, Prashan and Nicky have great diction so the videos are pleasant to listen to. I've used excel for years, however, there are still new things that I've learned from this course. I recommend this course to all the beginners out there!"
2020-11-08 00:00:00,Teresa C F A,5.0,0.0,"This basic excel course designed by Macquarie University is very well-crafted and responsive to the needs of somebody who does not have or have little background about the subject matter.  I consider myself an average excel user, but after enrolling in this course, I can now honestly say that I have become an expert and am more confident in presenting my financial report using this platform. I am very excited to take on the next step, which is the intermediate course.  
Thank you, Macquarie University and coursera for this course."
2021-09-28 00:00:00,Kellie C,5.0,0.0,I have participated in several Excel Skills courses in the past.  Coursera Excel Skills for Business: Essentials is by far the BEST skill development course available.  The learning modules allow you to develop skill with short lessons and plenty of self-directed practice. Being able to move at my own pace and practice until I mastered the skill is a GAME CHANGER for performance in  life and the workplace.  I highly recommend this training platform if you want to retain the material and build upon your knowledge in the future!  
2020-06-24 00:00:00,Atisheya M,5.0,0.0,"  I have completed the “Excel Skill for Business” specialization by Macquarie University after 90+ hours of resilient learning and growth. After completing this specialization, I can confidently say that I have gained deep insights into one of the most powerful spreadsheets and analytics tools i.e. Microsoft excel. The Specialization entails of four courses which covers all the concepts of Excel (Basics to Advanced). I would like to thank Nicky Bull, Prashan Karunaratne and coursera for providing me such a wholesome experience.  "
2020-02-29 00:00:00,Aleksandra R,5.0,0.0,"This course has been very helpful in teaching me the basic of Excel. It is very well structured; the instructors have excellent diction, examples and explanations; the practice quizes and assessments have been very well assembled; the additional readings provided have been interesting, fun and informative; the workbooks provided are easy to download and have been place in very sensible segments of the Course.

of the video presentations showing the various techniques which assist to build
confidence in navigating an excel work sheet. I have gained knowledge and
experience in the practice sessions as I made it my duty to stay the course. The

course that I will highly recommend to my work colleagues at the Barbados
Revenue Authority. Once again thanks to the presenters and remember, “Practice

I've been working with Excel for more than 15 years but knew I had gaps to fill - this course could not have been more perfect to help me identify and learn how to fill those gaps. The course was professional, the presenters were engaging and clear, the materials were easy to understand and well structured, and the practice tests and challenges were the perfect balance of difficult but encouraging. Well worth taking this course, I am now looking to move onto the second in the series. "
2020-08-13 00:00:00,Betsy W,5.0,0.0,"Excellent course! I have been a self-taught Excel user for many year, yet I didn't know the basics. I was completely impressed by the small baby steps to work through Excel, and the practice quizes. Nicki and Preshan make it very easy to learn, and I feel very confident to move forward with Excel in future career opportunities. I feel accomplished, energized, and ready for new challenges. I also thank McQuarie for offering this class through the MN DEED. It was an extremly useful class, and I appreciate the opportunity! "
2022-09-28 00:00:00,Anthony G,5.0,0.0,"Wow this course was awesome! I thought I knew like 50% of the course work (Self-Taught) but after completing this beginners course, i found out I was more like around 25% knowledgable. There were so much more I learned just from the basics. I was always intimidated by learning formulas, but after scoring 100% of the final assessment (With a big emphasis on formulas!) this course gave me the confidence in not being afraid to tackle the challenges of calculating formulas. I highly recommend this course for all beginners!"
2018-11-16 00:00:00,Fiona R,5.0,0.0,"Wow.  The professors teaching this course are so right - most of us are self-taught in Excel, and there are basics we can learn to do better.  My utmost respect was earned by how they broke down the overviews and exercises into manageable chunks.  I wouldn't know where to start to show someone how to use Excel as there are so many places to look!  Expertly done with user experience in mind.  I would recommend this course to both new users and experienced users.  Thank you for the effort you put into making this course.  "
2021-11-13 00:00:00,Josh A,5.0,0.0,"This was a wonderfully designed course that shows you how to navigate Excel step-by-step. I feel as though everything learned here sticks with the user as long as they use the materials properly. And go on and adventure into Excel on their own. You can't break Excel. Practice makes permanent. #everybodysaywow

However, there is an issue with one of the final assessment questions. Hint: You have to clear your filters before you use conditional formatting or the filters and that isn't explained to you between the steps."
2021-05-19 00:00:00,Chan T W,5.0,0.0,"This course showcases the most basic and most frequently-used functions of the MS Excel with very clear explanation on most frequently-used functions.

This course is recommended for beginners and good as a refresher course for those who have not been using Excel for some time.
This is not a course for those who are actually looking for more advance courses on Excel, but is a required course for ""Excel Skills for Business Specialization"" and might have some practical tips that we have probably ignored most of the time."
2020-07-16 00:00:00,Lily H,5.0,0.0,"As someone who has used Excel for many years but never received proper training or taken any courses, this was absolutely life-changing.  I realized how little I knew of Excel even in its basic usage! This course is very easy to follow, engaging and the ability to practice alongside each video and with the practice assignments are key to solidifying the concepts.  I found myself excited to learn and looking forward to the next module. I will be taking the next level and hope to finish all four levels in this series."

2022-01-26 00:00:00,AKSHAT D,5.0,0.0,"Explanations were great and the course work was quite excellent. I personally don't practice alot but the course work kept me engaged and had me put in the necessary efforts to make my knowledge of excel permanent. The guidance team was also great and so were the course videos. My only recommendation would be to reduce the amount of workbooks we got to download during intermediate quizzes. Its a hassle. Instead screenshots would work especially if we need to only tell cell value , formulas or cell reference. "
2020-06-18 00:00:00,Anubhav K,5.0,0.0,This course has provided me with skill set to operate through a long range of Excel features. A hands-on understanding and application of basic as well as hidden but extremely helpful excel commands has significantly enhanced my handling of this amazing software. I now feel very much comfortable maneuvering through large sets of data and making analyses based on them. Practice Videos helped a lot as the professors guided on each and every step of the way. Pursuing this course is well worth one's efforts!!!!
2020-06-01 00:00:00,Patricio R,5.0,0.0,I am really happy with my results. I am also really happy with the way they taught the course. I have truble learning new skills some times but the way both teachers taught it it was very clear. All thought I have a Mac and a 2017 excel and something are pretty different I managed to looked where thing were. I  enjoyed it very much. I completed in 7 days that fast it was even tough it says it is made to be learned in 6 weeks. Thanks im still in high school and I learned a skill most people learn in collage.  
2021-02-15 00:00:00,Laura G,5.0,0.0,"BEST EXCEL CLASS EVER!!!  Over the years I've taken a number of Excel classes and eventually gave up and resigned myself to only using the features I could figure out by trial and error. I learned so many things in this class that we ""ah ha!"" moments, and that I put to immediate use. I'm currently semi-retired but use Excel to track data from a small business and for my personal budget. I've updated both to reflect all that I learned. THANK YOU! Best instructors. Best layout of lesson plans. Best outcome."
2020-04-02 00:00:00,Peter L,5.0,0.0,"A very good first course for me here on Coursera. Although I've used Excel for many years at a basic level, I knew I had holes in my knowledge, and since I'll be starting a job next month with a high focus on Excel, I also knew I'd need to plug those holes. Although the videos are a little forced and trite, the overall package and teaching is pretty good and I can't really fault it. I'm glad I chose an Australia university to do the course with so their accents and terminology are closer to New Zealand."

Everything was explained very well . Final assessment was like cherry on the cake as it helped in Revising what has been taught over the weeks.
It was a good learning experience for me since this was my first-time experience doing a course online. Every point what was explained during the 6 weeks of the course it was easy to understand.  Thankyou !!!!"
2020-10-18 00:00:00,Prajwal S,5.0,0.0,The course is designed in such a way that a person who has almost zero to little experience with Excel will be able to work with charts by the end of the six week session. The practice sessions were awesome and the best part was the last overall exam which made us put to use everything that was taught in the last six weeks. The course is designed in such a way that not listening or not paying heed to the lessons will wreck havoc but it is easily recoverable with minimal effort. Overall it was awesome!
2021-01-14 00:00:00,NWOKOLO P,5.0,0.0,"Before enrolling for this course, I had always thought that I was an expert in Microsoft Excel considering the numerous self taught lessons I have taken. Amazingly, it was a different ball game as I ran through the lessons embedded in each week of the course. I got to realize that I had a whole lot of gaps to fill up. I meticulously went through the courses and I am super excited at my confidence level in the use of Microsoft Excel at present. 
Special thanks to FUT Minna, Coursera, Nicky and Prashan. "
2020-12-02 00:00:00,Asim S K,5.0,0.0,"I have been using Excel since 90's when I first entered University. By completeing this course i have learned methods, techniques, tools and much more which were simple to use but were not being used by myself as I did not have the time to try them out or did not know they even existed. The video's and the quizes working side by side helped me learn about Excel at my own pace. Thankyou very for helping me learn and made me realise that i can do it. FYI, this is my first ever course I have done ONLINE"
2022-01-23 00:00:00,Randy O,5.0,0.0,"Great foundational course.  I was familiar with Excel, but this was a nice review and I learned a lot along the way.  This filled in some gaps on things that I didn't quite understand, and it also taught me the 'right' way to do things that I was just sort of doing in the past via the 'brute force' method.  The PRINT discussion was extremely useful.  This was an area that I knew very little about.   Recommended for almost any skill level with Excel unless you consider yourself an 'expert' I suppose! "
2020-11-04 00:00:00,Cailene M U,5.0,0.0,Practice makes permanent is legiiiiiit. I learned a lot in this course- refreshed me on the old knowledge and taught me new things about Excel that I have not known yet. The presentation of the lesson is very clear and easy to follow. I enjoyed doing the challenges and I like that you really have to work hard on the quizzes because it's not just theories but you really need to apply what you have learned to be able to answer correctly. Thank you very much professors! See you in the next course :)
2020-09-04 00:00:00,Himani B,5.0,0.0,"Very good course. They explain very nicely. There are various assignments also. After watching videos, you can practice the assignments. And the best part is that you cannot find their answer from google. I mean you have to watch all the videos, practice it and then you can solve their assignments which is really nice. I am very much impressed by this. Because if you will find their answers on google then it is no use of doing such a course. And in videos, they also say Practice makes Permanent."
2020-09-30 00:00:00,Aikovin C,5.0,0.0,"Thank you, Macquarie University for an awesome presentation of this course. It was fun reviewing the basics and essentials of Excel and I got to learn some new shortcuts and tricks along the way. I love how there are practice quizzes after every lesson. It challenges my brain to recall what I just learned. I also enjoyed the practice challenges, the keyboard shortcuts, and the ninja tips. I had fun and I'm definitely down to take your intermediate and advanced courses. Here's to learning more!  "
2020-10-06 00:00:00,Carol P,5.0,0.0,Prior to this course I was self-taught on excel and was hesitant to take the class because I thought I wasn't going to learn anything new. I was wrong! The videos were short and to the point. I learned more than I thought and realized that the way I was doing some stuff one excel wasn't the easiest for the smartest way to get the job done. I finished the course early because I liked it that much and was eager to keep learning. I am going to take the rest of the courses in this specialization. 
2021-11-08 00:00:00,OLUWATOMI P,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed this course. I like the breakdown of the sections into little bits of video lessons which are followed by quick assessments to ensure you aren't lost along the way. Also it is worth mentioning that not 100% of the questions in the exercises are covered in the lessons, but playing around excel and practicing hands on you'll figure majority of it easily (I like this approach as it encourages more practicing and actually makes you better). Overall rating 5 star at least for this level"
2021-07-29 00:00:00,Satyam S,5.0,0.0,This course is designed brilliantly as it gives real world practical knowledge. The thing I loved most about this course is that it checks your knowledge practically it gives you the workbook and ask questions the you can't find without solving it perfectly and efficiently. And the video designing is also awesome because in the video each minor and major things are taken care of for example: when something is getting typed there is a sweet sound of old style keyboard plays in the background
2021-05-12 00:00:00,Shah H R,5.0,0.0,"It was an extensive, beautifully designed, practical course. It enriched me with some knowledge of Excel which I did not possess, and also refreshed my previous knowledge of Excel, in a fun and enticing manner. Content which was new for me was exciting to learn, and content which I had already had an idea about was not boring either. Great course, very insightful. Would like to add that ""Practice makes Permanent"" is repeated throughout the course, and it is the most apt teaching for Excel. "
2020-11-05 00:00:00,Ayana G S,5.0,0.0,"As someone who is already a bit familiar with basic Excel features, I still learned some pretty useful tips and tricks from this course! Some topics were a bit too easy for someone with a background in Excel, but it's good that I got to explore it a bit more through the challenges and quizzes. I learned about other features and options of Excel that I hadn't used before, and got some pretty useful shortcuts, too. These would certainly come in handy when making reports for my work."
2018-11-11 00:00:00,Carl F,5.0,0.0,"Five years from completing my BS in Accounting, three years from completing my MACC, and three years into a Governmental Accounting position, I feel qualified to state the ""Excel Skills for Business: Essentials"" course is a great refresher.

2020-03-19 00:00:00,Samyak J,5.0,0.0,"The course is very well structured and kudos to the whole team for delivering it with such articulation and effectiveness, it so made the entire course easy to understand and also a fun learning experience at the same time. I love how they make you revisit the concepts that you've learnt in the previous weeks in the practice challanges which really helps in making the concepts permanent.  I really enjoyed the course and I am looking forward to more courses with the institution."
2021-03-16 00:00:00,ANGBEEN S,5.0,0.0,"so far so forth before taking this course I was having zero knowledge of excel. I loved this course specially instructor Nicky, throughout the course they were providing practice quiz and practice handbooks that enhanced my skills, knowledge plus practice quiz encouraged me to watch all video carefully. I recommend this course for complete beginners who wants to excel there skills in excel they will reach to intermediate level after completing course. Thank you coursera <3"

On the other hand, some terms are completely foreign to me and don't know anything about its functions. Now, I am confident that whenever I open excel I won't be as fearful as I used to be. Thank you to the lecturers for presenting this course well. I am proud I finished this course ahead of schedule and with full understanding. Next Excel Course, shall we?"

2017-12-27 00:00:00,pamela a,5.0,0.0,OMG!!! I hadn't challenged myself since I graduated from college 25+ years ago.  I finished the course sooner than 6 weeks & I'm so proud of myself. I really enjoyed this course as I'm better equipped to make adjustments on my reports now. I intend to take the Intermediate levels because we use Pivot Tables and I have my struggles with that issue too.  Thanks for making this available for people like me who want to learn at home and need to know Excel in the work place.

The discussions at the start ,providing materials so that we can practice side by side, the interesting practice challenges that make use of skills learnt in that week, the quizzes in between the weeks and at the end of weeks ,exhaustive practice ,keyboard shortcuts, terminology and additional resources these are the things that makes this course a must for beginners in excel."

This the first time I learnt something in online mode and I have to say it was really very comfortable and fun studying here on coursera.. and I think I'm going to take the rest of the parts of this course.. Thank you Coursera.   "

Even if you are familiar with the basics of excel, you would likely become more efficient in your work. Cannot thank the team from Coursera and Macquarie University enough for putting this together. The illustrations were excellent and practical, which kept the interest going. I am going for the entire specialization straightaway!"

Just one hitch I would point out is that this course could be a bit complicated for Mac users, I studied on a Mac PC a few times and it was really tricky to follow. Maybe there could be separated courses for Mac and Microsoft users. 
Despite that, this course deserves five stars!"

However, I quickly realized that the foundations are very important part of excel and if you are not very familiar with them you will be in trouble later!

2021-09-30 00:00:00,Konstantinos L,5.0,0.0,"One of the best Courses I've done so far! Theory, practice exercises as well as quiz were really helpful to establish solid foundation in Excel. Even though I had some familiarity with Excel as in general, now I feel much more confident to do all those basic stuff which until know were kind of search-experimenting till find the right tool, succeed in constructing a nice print output. I hope the rest of the specialization be as good as this first course were."

Other than that the course is a great introduction to folks who want to learn more about excel. Personally I self-taught myself on the basics of Excel, but this course actually taught me new tips and tricks I did not know you could do on excel.

If I was having any trouble finding a tool that has moved or changed in the newer versions of Excel, it was simple to pause the video while I looked for the right tool, then start again once I had what I needed. The quizzes made sure you not only received the information in the videos, but understood it well enough to take problems a  step further on your own"

The curriculum was expertly designed for beginners like myself, where they picked up every topic from the base, explained everything with detail. I'm boosted up to cover the rest of three courses.

2020-06-29 00:00:00,Gianfranco R C,5.0,0.0,"Excelente curso, es bastante basico para el que ya usa excel, pero enseña mucho para el que va iniciando. Yo domino ingles y español, tristemente el que no sabe ingles no va a poder curzarlo. 

Excellent course, it is quite basic for those who already use excel, but it teaches a lot for those who are just starting out. I am fluent in English and Spanish, sadly the one who does not know English will not be able to study it."
2020-05-20 00:00:00,WW,5.0,0.0,"Perfect online course for study by yourself, especially for the confinement of COVID-19 and for adapting the new world after COVID-19. There you can learn the basic and essential tools of Excel. Once you finish your course, it's time for the intermediate course.

2022-06-15 00:00:00,Marc J D,5.0,0.0,"I​ have experienced some online platforms that offer tutorial in using Excel and out of all of them, I can say that this course was the best. They clearly taught the basics and functions of the tools and formats in Excel. The assignments, quizzes, and asssessment exams really test your understanding in using Excel. This also helps the student really apply what they have learned to necessarily answer the given questions."
2020-09-28 00:00:00,Karishma K,5.0,0.0,"I would say that I learn quickly all the bigest as well smallest tools, options and hidden settings to how to create a massive sheet in just a few minutes.

2019-06-01 00:00:00,Augustin P,5.0,0.0,"I have finished a course in Excel essentials or as I would say a beginners course. I learned a lot although it took me some time to finish, but now I feel confident in working in Excel when it comes to basics and as I go again through the course for revision, I am really satisfied with my usage of shortcuts on the keyboard. I will for sure keep learning and continue developing my skills through the intermediate course."
2018-05-14 00:00:00,Grzegorz S,5.0,0.0,"This course is great, because in short time it's possible to obtain real-life skills, useful in every day work with spreadsheets (actually, what I'd learned for instance in week 2, I applied straight away in my job, making life little easier for myself and my workmates). One remark though - if you decide to take this course, install Excel on your computer, online version is not enough to complete it without any stress."
2022-03-16 00:00:00,ionela f,5.0,0.0,"At first, I thought it would be just an online simple course that wouldn't engage too much in actually teaching you something but after I started it I changed my opinion. Great website if you want to learn a new hard skill. Perfect for Beginners with Microsoft Excel. I Can say that I have truly learned how to use the essentials in Excel. I recommend it 100%.

2021-02-24 00:00:00,Manzur A,5.0,0.0,"I had an excellent time with this course. As I am a beginner in Excel, I found the teaching methodology in this course excellent and very ingenious. I did not know myself that there could be such fun way of learning Excel. In some portions, e.g. Print and Charts, I wondered how are they going to devise tests and assignments for such portions, but they did a brilliant and creative work with these as well. Kudos !!!"
2020-04-25 00:00:00,Munshi A M,5.0,0.0,This course was exceptionally good. I knew many things but learn a lot of tools which i did not know before this course. The course was designed in a fantastic way. If a person does not know anything about excel can learn a lot of things from this course and can be able to use the learning in any one's day to day life. It was amazing doing this course. I recommend people who want to improve their skills in Excel.
2020-01-02 00:00:00,Julia,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed doing the Excel course and learned so much. I so much enjoyed the explanation and then doing the assignment after. This really helped me with practicing and I aimed to get all the questions right. If I get one wrong, I would go back to the video listen again and repeat the test. I definitely recommend this course for students or professionals who want to sharpen their knowledge. Thank you so much "
2019-06-07 00:00:00,정희현,5.0,0.0,I knew nothing about Excel and had zero confidence in using it. But this course changed it over. I strongly recommend this course for anyone who feels like they know barely anything about Excel. It might feel a bit too essential from time to time but you'll soon realize such essentials will help you boost through other more difficult tasks! Looking forward to taking different courses in Excel Skills for Business!
2018-10-27 00:00:00,Leslie G,5.0,0.0,"An exceptionally well planned out introduction and overview to the fundamentals of Excel.  Although I had business proficiency from on the job learning, this first segment already proved to be of solid value and filled in several gaps in my execution as well as speed of execution.  I am very pleased with this course already and greatly look forward to the next segments.  This is a very well done learning process!"
2020-09-21 00:00:00,AMJAD K,5.0,0.0,"The Course was top class with very challenging assessments on every video. The subject was well narrated and broken down into much required weeks. The stress on practice was perfect and very much need. It's very important to learn the right terms and tips than to just learn on the job as we do mostly. 

Nicky is very engaging with her voice and smiling face. She kept me hooked on the content and is easy to follow.

2021-01-15 00:00:00,Isaac O K,5.0,0.0,"
Excellent course for either refreshing Excel basics or for Excel 
novices. The course is well-organized, well-paced, has clear and 
too-the-point videos and additional material. There are good exercises 
to do before the assessments each week and before the final assessment. 
As a regular Excel user, I enjoyed the extra Ninja tips and learnt new 
things by knowing more short-cuts so as to work more efficiently.

During the next weeks, the course began to challenge me in many ways i couldn't imagine previously.

2018-06-22 00:00:00,Petra E C,5.0,0.0,"I'm a beginner/intermediate user of Excel and know the fundamentals. However, I can appreciate the beauty and usability of it and the importance of having an intermediate (or better yet, advanced) knowledge of it no matter your job or your career level. This course is a step-by-step tutorial to help you learn in a way that it's not intimidating or confusing. Once you start the course you'll get addicted to it."
2020-12-05 00:00:00,Edwina-Liz S,5.0,0.0,"I really enjoyed  this course, and the way it was taught. And I especially liked the clever way of how the quizzes and challenges were prepared in order for the student to know whether or not he found the right answer.
I was also amazed by the small things excel can do to facilitate our work and I feel more knowledgeable already about Excel.
Special thanks for the instructors and their amazing ways of teaching. "

2022-05-22 00:00:00,Kelly U,5.0,0.0,"I expected to already know a lot of this course, because I've been using spreadsheets for a couple of decades. However! I was introduced to quite a few features that I didn't realise existed; and ones that I had wondered how to use, but hadn't had reason to learn. It's a great all rounder introduction to Excel, and gives me faith that I'll be able to head into the Intermediate Excel courses with confidence."
2020-08-29 00:00:00,José A E C,5.0,0.0,"Creo que este curso te enseña perfectamente las ventajas de Excel para usuarios que necesitan realizar un trabajo profesional y de la manera mas rápida y eficaz posible.

2020-06-01 00:00:00,Erik M,5.0,0.0,"Tough work and long hours put into it, but it's worth it. It took my years of experimenting with and playing around with excel and not knowing most of it and turned it into a disciplined and structured format for my mind to realize what I had been doing so far and vast gaps that I had been missing. If COVID hadn't happened, I probably would be doing the entire course and other levels, but we'll see now. "
2018-11-17 00:00:00,Antonio J L R,5.0,0.0,"Based in my experience, If you have been using excel for work with data in university, this course it will be too easy for you, although it help me to fill out some gaps i had.

2019-03-15 00:00:00,Malee M,5.0,0.0,I loved taking this class. I have learned so much more in a few weeks than years working in the office. The videos are great but my favorite part was the down loadable work along worksheets which are provided. I need to practice along and not just watch videos otherwise its very difficult for me to really learn and remember the material so I highly recommend this class to anyone that works an office. 
2018-07-09 00:00:00,Merve B,5.0,0.0,It is the best course that I have taken on Coursera so far.

2020-05-09 00:00:00,KEERTHI V S,5.0,0.0,"Best course I could have ever got. They explained everything in detailed and did give some time for us to learn it ourselves by trying it out. They also made sure to not over explain everything and gave us space to explore and find new stuff on our own , which in my opinion helps memorizing it. I would encourage anyone in commerce field to go for this course as it helps out big time in the long run."

Al mismo tiempo, los oradores se expresan de forma pausada, permitiéndote ver en la pantalla e ir volcando lo que se explica en el archivo de Excel adjunto, lo cual te permite poder ir haciendo las actividades sin estar pausando y reanudando el video constantemente."
2021-05-02 00:00:00,Ivan I,5.0,0.0,"This course has an excellent format. It is 100% online and there are videos that to show you exactly what to do. And if you miss anything, you just have to rewind.

Thank you."
2022-07-11 00:00:00,Khushbu s,5.0,0.0,"It is a very well designed program for basic and essential learning of Excel.
Program is divided into core topics for better understanding of all the required basic from all the options,formula even how you can effeciently print. These may look like easy topics but unless, you have seen these videos you would be shocked about all the hidden tools that excel has detailled to help us with.Thankyou"

The presenters were clear and gave plenty of opportunities to apply what you've learned. The final exam was a bit challenging since you had to remember all the details of six weeks but you can always go back and review any of the material if you forget. Thank you, Macquarie University!"
2020-07-06 00:00:00,Dhanush B,5.0,0.0,"This was a great opportunity for me to get such a quality online education for a renowned university. The way of teaching is just very simple to understand.

Still, this course provided the information in such an organized method that it has been so helpful and provided me to sink in the essentials very well can't wait for the intermediate. Although the only complaint I would have is that the charts section was too simplified felt very annoying uninformative, unfortunately."
2021-05-23 00:00:00,Worraporn P,5.0,0.0,"I enjoyed the class so much but not the quiz part. lol It will be nice to add the explanation of what I had done wrong or what the correction should be so I could understand my mistake better. It was quite frustrated that I did not know what I did wrong and trying to fiqure it out. But don't get me wrong besides of that, I absolutely enjoyed the class and learned a lot. Thank you both of you! "
2020-06-05 00:00:00,Muhammad H J ,5.0,0.0,If you are a person who just knows how to scroll between cells of excel and nothing else. This course is for you. Imparts all essentials skills. The best part is you will not be able to copy from anywhere and will do all stuff solely yourself so it's a huge learning experience. You will not be able to find the answers to the assessments of this course. So it's a very good learning experience.
2017-12-25 00:00:00,Trey ,5.0,0.0,This was a great course to make sure that you understand the basics of Excel.  The video explanations were definitely helpful in completing the course.  The only issue I had was during the final assessment the worksheet to download for some reason was not set right and when trying to autofill it would only go down 10 rows instead of the whole worksheet other than that it was a great course!
2021-09-24 00:00:00,Saloni M,5.0,0.0,This was an extremely helpful course!

2020-05-23 00:00:00,Timothy R,5.0,0.0,I like the self pace.  Some questions throughout the session exams were unnecessarily confusing.
