2017-10-05,Eric V H,1,85,I did not find this course helpful. The assignments seem to ask for more info that you've been taught in any of the videos. My analogy for the course is this: It's like making a newborn baby watch a video on swimming and then throwing it into the ocean and acting shocked when it doesn't know how to swim. The mentors in the discussion forum are condescending and do not help when you don't understand the terms they are using. I would not recommend this course for beginners.
2016-01-17,Brittany N,5,84,"After trying tutorial after tutorial and exploring many different resources to learn Python, I have finally found one that works! This is a very fun course, and the free textbook is simply incredible.

2016-09-04,Liang Z,5,72,"The professor's lecture is so awesome, however, the content is adjust to the new programming learners. I heared extended part of the course is charged,  you can purchased it if you want deeper learning"
2018-03-29,Adam K,5,65,Very good introduction to basic programming. Very easy for beginners in python who have already some programming background - but still extremely useful to quickly and efficiently learn python basics.
2018-01-02,Tristan L,5,60,Thank you. It was a worthwhile course. Entertaining as well. I just wish that there were more sample homework before the exercises so students could see how the lessons are applied to actual problems. 
2016-11-12,Jerol T,5,58,"I completed the course in about three days. I've never programmed before to the learning curve was excruciating but nonetheless I managed to get through and finally get my python feet wet so to speak.

2019-05-25,Yuxin N,5,35,this course is extremely suitable for an individual who does not know anything about python. but after i learned the course . it seems  like a litter bit of easy. i commend that at the final of the course. the text should tend to more difficult so that people who learn this course can actually improve programming skill
2019-06-07,Mritunjay S,5,29,"i know about a bit of programming language skills by using c or c++. But i also wanted to learn about the python programming language, so i decided to go with coursera & i want to say....waao...Dr. Chuck is awesome, the way he taught is pretty great... i mean to say that... this course is pretty awesome for everyone who want to go with python programming language So, i'm highly recommending to go with this course. "
2019-03-06,Patrick M,5,28,"Excellent course.  The pace was perfect, it was not so long that it was daunting to finish and it did not take too much weekly free time either.  Despite this, I was still able to learn a great deal and am still motivated to continue with the rest of the specialization.  "

2018-11-04,David R J,5,19,I loved it! Dr. Chuck is extraordinary in his explanations. A great way to start on Python programming. As a person that hasn't programmed in years it was an encouraging and educational experience :-)
2019-03-27,Cyntia G,1,19,"Two weeks of all sort of nonsense, including macarena, Harry Potter, sorting hat, videos of meaningless travels and lots of self-promotion. Pure crap that doesn´t worth anybody´s time. When theory started on week 3 it was confusing, boring and as time is life I decided to quit.  It shocked me that a serious university like University of Michigan has a clown on its payroll."

2017-08-06,Connor B,1,16,"I got a 95% and maybe I learned something but I can honestly say it wasn't because I watched the videos - the professor is seriously disconnected. Programming for ""Everybody""? I know what I want to do with programming, but all the examples and small programs you write in this course give you no idea of what of someone outside science and math will ever use programming for. "
2016-01-26,Kseniia G,5,14,"A really simple and what is the most important a clear course.
Really hope that next sessions are created in the same manner.
Will highly recommend to anyone who decides to start studying Python
"
2016-05-11,Terence P,1,13,"To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short.  It was too basic and slow paced.  The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals.  And it's certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class.  Even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that  while providing more content, and making the content relevant. 

Is the course worth the price?  Hell no.  If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end.  The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes.  One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.    

I'm not sure about the value of the videos titled ""Office Hours.""  They all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this video in Paris.""  They're really nothing more than that.  In one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off:  ""other people here would like to talk with me too.""  After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?""  ""What was the point?""  And you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""another waste of time."""
2015-10-20,Steve M,1,13,We tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming.  Python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio (nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his life-time idol at a trade-show or watch the Intel versus AMD melt-down commercials over their lunch break).

2018-01-08,Frederick U,5,10,"Tan solo auditar este curso me ayudó bastante en el aprendizaje de este lenguage de programación. A penas ahorre el dinero compraré el resto de cursos para seguir adelante. Gracias Charles Severance!!

"
2020-08-18,Leonard W,1,10," If I were to compare the quality of this class to something I would say that this class is like a Chess class that spends 30 minutes explaining how pawns work and then asks you to move Knight to C3. ""Wait, what piece is the Knight? How does the Knight move again? What's C3? Help!""  That's basically what you will get out of this course.
This class is not a good choice for someone starting from the ground up. It's no so much that it doesn't cover entry-level concepts, rather it fails to elaborate on these concepts. The feedback from the quizzes doesn't point you in the direction where you can learn from your mistakes.
Likewise the assignments are often two steps ahead of the video, meaning that when error messages pop up in the auto-grader there is no way to figure out where you can learn what you did wrong. the videos will cover steps a, b, and c but the assignments expect you to know steps d, e, and f. This leaves students to discuss the answers in the forums or on other sites which I understand is frowned upon. However for ""green as grass"" students this is the only way to get anything done. And when students try to explain how the code actually works to each other their threads get locked down, only cryptic and vague responses to issues will remain.  That is abysmal.
When I seem to get more help from other students in the comments than from the moderators in the forum, that is an issue. And lets talk about the moderator, there is only one. One for how many students? One for how many questions? Even if there was just 5 more people answering in the forums it would greatly improve the quality of this class. And those moderators should do more than just refer students back to the book which often provides insufficient information to tackle a problem. 
This class needs to be reviewed extensively.  I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone fresh that wants to try to learn code. "

2017-01-27,Stuart K,2,9,"The course material is fine. In fact its good. However I completed the entire course in 4 hours. Whilst I have some basic programming experience I am by no means an expert. There really is very very little material in this course. The assignments are also very simple and automatically graded. The course fees are not particularly transparent. I think the course is FAR too expensive for the content provided. All of the other reviews I have seen for this course are a single line such as 'I liked the course a lot' or something equally vacuous and unhelpful. If you are a beginner I would suggest trying 'Python for the absolute beginner' by Michael Dawson. If you have ANY programming experience, you might be better with a more advanced course."

2019-07-26,Jan H H,4,6,"Good systematic course for beginners - although for real beginners some parts may be quite a bit too geeky, the promise that even if you don't know much about computers you will still be able to follow the course doesn't convince me. If you had some experience with programming, go at your own speed with the course materials and you will be able to finish within a couple of hours - I finished the whole seven weeks in two days, not working on it full time and watching all the videos, which is not really necessary. Some of the examples don't seem to make much practical sense, which would be good for motivation, but they serve their purpose to understand syntax and structure. Some have errors, which is surprising given the huge audience that can help to correct them. There are extra materials about hard- and software developers that are not really connected."
2015-10-08,L. W,1,6,"I am very disappointed with this programming course. The course lacks detail and deepth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks. The quizzes and assignments were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough. Annoying was the overuse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as usefull as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?), the pointless and useless doodles, smilies and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video. The Tutor tried to loosen a dry topic. Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that. I had hoped for more :("
2020-07-15,ADITYA K D o E,1,6,"i feel this isn't a course for beginners it should be for intermediates as i found the exercises very hard and moreover the instructor teaches basic stuff and the graded assignments are tough before some assignments he doesn't even discusses those type of problems. All i'm saying is anybody taking this course as a beginner without any prior knowledge in programming ,he/she would be discouraged."
2019-01-13,Kanei P,1,6,"Most vague info, assignments don't even have  anything to do  with the videos, and the videos are not helpful because they don't give any examples. Terrible, and extremely hard. I do not recommend this course to beginners, or to anyone for that fact.

"
2018-03-06,Luca,3,4,"The course states it is meant to be for everybody but the frequent mention of error messages and how they are not meant to judge the student makes me thing it is meant for teenagers or a generally young audience. 
Some concepts are introduced very quickly and without the proper background. The exercises are mostly on the easy side and they do not build on each other (example: functions are introduced in a class but not used in the following exercises). This ends giving the impression that the course is not well structured and does not try to make the student find synergies between concepts.
While this can work somehow for most of the course, the last week sees the introduction of some very advanced concepts (None and IS) which are just barely touched, leaving the student to have to search for information outside of the course. This is made worse by the overtly restrictive requirements of the assignments that use the autograder. The autograder does not let you explore potential pitfalls in your code, which are much better clarified by using the debugger (not introduced) or the python online visualizer (not introduced). I strongly advise to introduce one of these two tools in the course."
2017-01-28,Maaike G,3,4,"Although the course pace was very well suited for a total beginner, I found the didactics of this course not so well-structured. The examples and starter codes caused quite some confusion, and the underlying coding principles were not made very explicit. I've finished an introductory Python course from the University of Toronto, and found that course much better structured. It gave me a level of understanding that I would probably not have reached by following the UMich course alone. "
2015-12-20,Stephen Z,1,4,This course has been dumbed down so much that no moderately intelligent person should be subjected to it.  Coursera really needs to rethink its approach to teaching.  I can only express my sympathy for those were seduced into actually paying for this course.
2020-09-13,Ajay k N G,5,3,  Very good introduction to basic programming. Very easy for beginners in python who have already some programming background - but still extremely useful to quickly and efficiently learn python basics.  
2017-09-07,Jeff W,4,3,"Coming at this with no experience in coding at all, this course was extremely difficult. I think the most difficult part of this class was following the videos. The reason is because real world uses weren't given very often. I struggled with motivation nearing the end of this course because the examples in the videos focused on the ""what"" the code does and not so much the ""why."" Because of this, the usefulness of some of the discussed functionalities in python are still unknown to me. To remedy that, I would recommend the exercises in the videos reflect what will be done in the assignments, at least to some degree. I couldn't help but get hung up on what ""zork"" had to do with anything (among a few other examples), or why I would ever need to find the largest letter in a phrase like ""hello world."" In fact, I think my biggest struggle going through this course was fighting thoughts like, ""what am I going to use this for?"" I would like to see more content related to solving real world problems, even if it's just in the bonus content.
Overall, while it was very difficult, I really do recommend this course to others, and in fact I already have recommend it to two of my friends. The instructor seems like a really awesome guy, he's easy to listen to, and overall he's the kind of teacher than any student would love to have. "

2016-10-21,Josh M,1,3,"This Course is bad! I try to ask for help and then mentors only reply with I cant help you because of the Honor code. Well tat doesn't sound like much of an honor code to me. Of course I am doing my own work duh! I just need help. Dont we all need help from time to time. I think Coursera needs a lot of improvement. I am extremely dissatisfied with Coursera and this course but especially the mentors and their lack of mentoring. Education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog. I mean really I think Coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and If I can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that whats the point of a discussion board. Do away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written. Yes I agree with Honor and doing your own work but come on. Help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning! Please make the necessary changes to better Coursera and make it a more positive educational experience. I mean please I am trying the best I can with what I have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skills and my understanding. Make changes and make them now.
Another reason I hate this course Is that Coursera does not believe in people helping one another. Then the mentors cant even explain how to work through the problem. The menotrs make things more stressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues. People need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own. I just think Coursera is crap and this has been a very unpleaseant experience for me. Then on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the mentos dont help them. People are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out. Things need to change with this program. They need to change soon!"
2019-03-22,Tony F,5,2,"This class served as not only my introduction to Python, but to programming in general. For whatever reason, programming can seem like a daunting task to people, including me. However, Professor Severance had a casual, yet confident attitude that made each week feel like an approachable game that happens to be very useful. I didn't expect to have a great time watching the lectures, but I did. Obviously, I'm not very advanced yet with programming, but it seemed to me Professor Severance was great at anticipating faulty habits or inclinations and nipping those in the bud for us beginners. He has well-constructed examples to explain his points without making them overly complex. In short, I think the title of the course is apt; it does a good job at making Python understood by everybody who is interested to learn. Thanks for the solid foundation!"
2018-08-19,Nimit R,5,2,  Very well explained the concepts of programming in the context of Python and that too with good fun. Love you Chuck  
2020-01-03,L S,3,2,"NB: I audited this course so did not get feedback on assignments. If you are a true beginner, and have no programming or computer experience whatsoever this course is for you. Dr. Severance explains the concepts VERY well using great metaphors and he's quite engaging. However, he takes an incredibly long time to do this and uses many many words and there are many mostly irrelevant videos. If you have any coding experience at all, you might find it better to download python and the free book (which is written in the same engaging style using the same conceptual metaphors) and go at your own pace. The book is really really fabulous and you don't have to listen to the lectures at 1.5 speed waiting for something useful."

I loved the way he teaches, he taught some deep topics very easily. It was very simplified and examples were so relatable and the way he made me understand the codes, I just started to fall in love with programming !

After this course, I am not only clear with the algorithms and control flow but also I have learned many techniques to easily code. 

I have got a free book, with this course, which is the easiest programming book I have ever read!!! 

I tried to code by my self after learning a topic, I gave myself some problems and solved by myself which gave me confidence. 

In this course I have learned about basic programming, overview of python, hardware and software relations,hardwere overview,variables,conditionals,function,user defined function,loop and control statement and so on.

 "
2018-11-19,John D,5,1,"This course is very basic, teaching you fundamental sequential, conditional, and looping expressions of Python. The materials are assembled and arranged very nicely. If you are curious how this course translate to the undergraduate course that can be taken in some best Universities, well this course is roughly like 1/4 of the materials that is covered in an undergraduate Python course. The whole series of five courses here on Coursera probably count towards one undergraduate course in a prestigious school such as Carnegie Mellon University. Though this course is very good, explaining the basic materials very well, this course alone cannot make you a real Python programmer. You probably need to register the whole specialization to have a entry level feel of a Python programmer"
2020-04-02,Sartaj J C,5,1,"  Well Python, though was the first programming language that I ever picked up to learn when I was in my high school, I didn't continue coding in python(regretfully) after finishing cover to cover two books 1) Head First Python by O'Reilly Publications ; 2) How to think like a computer scientist: using python. After a long break I started learning Java when I started studying Computer Science at university and after coding in Java for almost two years and learning a lot of data structures and algorithms and implementing them using Java, I totally forgot how to write Python codes so this was a very good quick, informative and adequate revision. I feel like a Pythonista already. Going to continue the second part of this course too. Thank you !!  "
2020-03-06,Lisa S,5,1,"Excellent starting point course. Very easy to follow and understand. Terrific instructor who explains things well, is never dull and is easy to listen to. The ""office hours"" videos seemed a little unnecessary. I'm not sure what the point of those was. I found this course quite easy, probably because I have a B. Sc. in Computer Science, although that was a while ago. I really liked learning how to install and use Atom (Atom Nightly for Mac was the one that worked... search for Apple support note about that -- regular Atom will not download), Python and Terminal, none of which I was familiar with before. Great job! I will take more courses in this specialization for sure !"

I'm an aspiring programmer and have a very little knowledge in programming, but I learned a lot from this course. His material are easy to understand and he knows the topic in depth.  He presents it in a clear, plain language that's technical.
In terms of accessibility: The lectures have subtitles and interactive transcripts in the feature. The audio is clear and doesn't have any noise background. Great job!
I totally recommended this course to those who want to learn python with no programming experience and technical background. Very thoroughly discussed at your own pace."
2020-04-08,Sohel S,5,1,"This course is really simple and does what it says. It gets you started with Python and basic programming. If you are not introduced to Python at all and would like to learn, this should be your go-to option. The instructor is really knowledgeable and really fun at the same time. I would like to advise on completing the next course ""Python: Data Structures"" as well to get acquainted with lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc. and programs utilizing these concepts. This would really round up the introductory concepts in Python."
2020-04-06,Wilson W,5,1,"This course is hands down my favourite programming course (And I've taken a lot of programming courses). 
Dr. Chuck (the instructor) teaches so well. He makes the class fun and even tells stories during lessons. He also tries to be as friendly as possible. That makes the learning experience so much better.
The concepts are clear and they're explained properly too. And the assignments in the middle make sure that you really pay attention to the course.
If you are looking for a course to start learning Python, this is the one."
2020-03-26,Derek R,5,1,"This course is fantastic! I always looked at coding as some dark magic that I would never understand. Now, after this course, I want to continue mastering this skill set and understand how else I can use to to manipulate, interpret, and display data. The instructor is wonderful, and I am now actively looking for his other courses to take next. My only suggestion is for some of the exercises to be displayed via Windows and not just Mac, but that's an extremely minor issue. I highly recommend this instructor. Great course."
2018-04-12,Ngoc N,5,1,"Great lectures, great text book.  
I really liked the professor - in his videos he progresses fast enough that you don't get bored, but slow enough that you can understand the material.  I generally dislike watching instructional videos because I'd rather read the instructions and do it at my own pace, which is usually faster than the video's pace, but I didn't mind watching these.  I also liked the fact that he had a textbook that you can use as reference so that you don't have to re-watch the videos over and over again."
2017-09-18,Miki S,5,1,"I started this course with zero knowledge of programming: 20 years ago, I have learned basic HTML, that's all. I am not a computer or technology person at all. However, Dr. Chuck's teach method made me feel like the contents are simple. In the latter half of the course, I struggled to do assignment of making a code. Because I need to use more function, and my brain hadn't fully understood how to use those functions. I reviewed my note many times and finished assignments. Thank you for your excellent lecture, Dr. Chuck!!"
2019-09-19,Amit K,5,1,"This was my first ever course online and I am happy to say that I had a satisfying experience. The great thing about this course is that not only the instructor is dedicated and really puts his heart into teaching the material; all the necessary steps are taken to ensure the student's success; that the student can really complete the course without getting demotivated. I highly recommend this course to the beginner programmers, who have never written any code and want to learn to code in an fun yet challenging manner."
2018-03-10,Mrinal V,5,1,"Out of all the courses that I have taken on Coursera, this one left me with a smile on the face as I worked through the content week by week. Professor Chuck has a humorous and engaging style of teaching. The bonus materials are absolutely a charm, I loved seeing so many students as they meet and greet with professor and share their experiences. The exercises are a great way of beginning in programming and are very relevant to the material being taught. I am eager to take more courses from this specialization."
2021-06-02,YU M,5,1,"A very good course not only helps people learn the programming language but also helps people know ""the way computer think"". I used to think programming is all about remembering of all the syntax and reuse them. This course let me know sth more than that. The teaching process is really important and you will find it super usesful when you cannot remember some syntax properly because it helps you to understand the language.
Overall,  it's a great start for people who want to learn programming."
2020-11-02,Xiaojun L,5,1,"I finished this course in a few days instead of a month. This is a great course for the debutants as me. It is easy to understand, and doctor Chuck's sense of humors makes it fun to learn. I can do simple code now thanks to the course. Every time I accomplished the assignment, I just felt so happy about it even tho it took me time to figure out the right code. In a word, I'm satisfied with this course and I would totally recommend it to those who want to debut their journey of Python:)"
2020-10-31,Nkem I,5,1,"Dr. Chuck is a gifted teacher and professor, some might consider what I have been able to achieve with this course not a big deal and they would be wrong. The joy that comes with being able to solve a problem statement by breaking it down into small chunks and thinking out the logic of the steps is immeasurable. I set out my mind to learn how to program for the third time and I am confident I will be able to tackle what comes next. Thank you Dr. Chuck, Thank you Coursera."
2021-08-18,Trang P Q,5,1,"Thank you, instructor! ❤ The course is my first step to the CS world that I have been dreaming of. Thank you for helping me and thousands of students take off successfully with your detailed explanations on every issues and your hilarity, which make the lessons so enjoyable! Huge thanks and appreciations ❤❤❤ (completing the course just felt like having just graduated from university 😂, I don't know why but I 100% will study your next courses!)"
2019-10-16,Liu W,5,1,"Incredible course!!! 1. Python is so complicated but the course is simple (maybe just at the beginning, for people like me with thin mathematics foundation and no knowledge of programming at all!) 2. The logic of the course is very clear and simple to understand 3. The arrangement is not so tight, therefore is friendly to people who have full-time job like me! 4. Coursera is incredible!!! See you in the next course! "
2020-10-30,Shoham E,5,1,"Even though I have never met Mr. Severance I must say that he is one of the best teachers that I have ever been taught by ! an excellent teacher who is calm, assuring and confident-inspiring for new programmers ! The course covered the very basics of the Python language in a great way, and I'm very confident in my abilities to continue the specialization with the tools that I have acquired from this course. "
2021-02-22,祝先生,5,1,"Wonderful as this course ""Getting Started with Python"" is, there are still a stupendous amount of important but tiny points of knowledge hiding behind these lessons we need take, where we should still explore more during the leisure time of ours and if necessary, try to predict how these stuff would be used later, plus making some questions by yourself. 
Sincerely hope this comment helpful.  "
2021-06-02,蔡涵涵 T H F,5,1,"I've written a little bit python before, but never officially take a course on it. After finishing this course, I feel really worthwhile, and I will definitely keep going on it. This course helps me a lot on learning how python works in a specific way.
Dr. Chuck is pretty thoughtful, and I love those bonus videos very much. It makes me feel involved in the python learning community!
"
2020-05-15,Powsali G,5,1,"This is an amazing course. I used to be so scared to computer programming. But I enjoyed this course so much that I actually enjoyed doing the assignments. I completed the course in just 9 days which is awesome. This just proves that if the professor is engaging, students will love learning. I am very very greatful to the instructor. This has been a wonderful experience."
2022-03-03,H. W H C K,5,1,"`This is a great Python course for beginners. Before I follow this course; I had some knowledge about Python . But I had some doubts in some areas. This course covered them all very simple way. 
And the supporting staff is really helpful, replyied all the questions without any delay. 
I think this will be a great opportunity for future followers of this course. Thanks!"
2020-05-10,Ridwan B,5,1,"I cannot describe my joy at achieving this feat. It was an interesting and fulfilling experience. Although, a complete beginner, I was able to comprehend the lessons owing to the simple language used by the instructor. Thank you so much, Professor Charles. I sometimes had tough times, but it was worth it. I won't relent at this level, I will continue to soar higher."
2020-09-06,GEORGIOS P,5,1,"A very interesting and useful online course for begginers. I think it's a great opportunity for everyone to spend some time with this course, as you can learn the basics about Python programming and more. Thanks Charles Severance for this amazing online course!
I'm looking forward to attend the next courses of this specialization!
"
2021-04-16,Luke M,5,1,I found the course excellent in introducing and getting a person excited about programming. The course explained the topics well and very understandable. The one thing I have against the course was the final project. I found its difficulty didn't correlate with the difficulty of the assignments one the previous chapters. 
2019-03-08,Lorilyn M,5,1,"I love the teaching style of Dr. Severance!! I've tried so many other tutorials online but his class is by far my favorite. He helps cement connections by use of metaphors and visual aids and as a student who has traditionally favored subjects such as language arts, it has been invaluable to my learning experience!!"
2020-11-09,Manuel A,5,1,"I never expected to start learning ""on my own"" something a little bit ""technical"" like this. But everything in this course is really well thought and done. It's great, motivating and I could see myself getting hooked into learning more Python or more curious about programming by this positive experience. "
2019-10-16,Nikhitha N B,5,1,"I have gone through plenty of materials for python and also did few data science courses.But I regret taking this course at the first place.Dr Severance’s lectures are very neat and easy to understand.I never understood basics so well before :)
I am very grateful to be a part of this specialisation "
2020-06-29,Alto P,5,1,"I struggled, had to watch most of the videos  2  or even 4 times, but I have completed it.
The instructor is highly professional, a true teacher. I started with the Python course by Google and it was poorly explained. The instructor here knows exactly what beginners' learning process is like."
2020-04-03,Arjun B,5,1,The best online course I have taken so far. Charles Sir used a very simple way to convey his knowledge with his best efforts. You will learn every python basics. The topic I liked most is except and try and Functions. I am grateful to Coursera for providing such a great platform for us. 
2019-03-06,Yvonne V,5,1,"I am an absolute beginner to programming. I find this course a clearly instructed one for beginners. The course design is pragmatically useful because you need to practice by yourself, going through videos and books, in order to pass all the assignments. It is worth it in the end!"
2020-07-12,Karunesh p,5,1,"This is the course from which i  came to know as a first time , how does the python looks like?
I  got amazed every time when i was writing my code due to its simplicity and  readability.
NO doubt Chuck sir plays a very crucial role.
I am very eager and excited to go  for part two.
"
2021-03-05,Erica C,5,1,Great course! I started with zero experience in programming and feel like it was broken down enough for me to keep up and get a good understanding of each concept. Dr. Chuck is engaging and makes it fun to learn these very basics. Looking forward to more courses!
2022-07-25,Alper A,5,1,I think that this course is a must for people that have never learned or have a  little knowledge about Python. The flow of the lectures and the friendly attitude of the instructor makes you sit infront of the computer for hours and not want to take a break.
2020-03-24,Sergio P,5,1,"I had not programmed in  years. I took this course and in less than a week, I was reliving my youth in my programming years. I guess it's kind of like riding a bike. You never forget. But having a good class like this one as a refresher sure makes it easier."
2019-03-08,Miranda E,5,1,I really liked Dr Severance. He kept my interest and didn't drone on about things....had a great personality and didn't assume you knew everything he has learned throughout his entire career. He has made me want to take the entire specialization. Great Job!
2020-02-03,Андрей П,5,1,"Hi, sorry for my English. I'm learner from Russia and i'm already know python basics so i want to learn english programming stuff. It's very interesting and simple to understand for beginners, but for me i want more complex task. Thanks for course."
2020-04-02,Maruf I,5,1,"It was an amazing experience with Dr. Chuck. Thanks, Sir, for your amazing teaching and help me to learn a new language. Anybody who's looking for a perfect start in the kingdom of Python can take this course without thinking twice. Happy Coding!!"
2020-09-02,Diana M,5,1,"  Regardless of its simplicity, caused by nothing else but the fact that this is a course meant to build a fundamental knowledge of the language, the course never gets boring. This is by virtue of Dr Chuck's immense talent and skill for teaching.  "
2019-03-06,Samantha R,5,1,Excellent course! The videos are great and the exercises push you. Very good course to get into the basics. The material is made available which is great to use as a reference for afterward. By far the best online course for beginners.

2019-05-17,Songjie G,5,1,great!
2015-09-22,Pritesh P,4,1,"Excellent overview of first few concepts in Programming in Python. Useful in understanding programming concepts (early early stages) for those who have never done programming and refresher for those who have, but it has been a while, I look forward to seeing how the other courses in the this series are. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because I think in addition to the given assignments there should be an extra assignment per week with practical applications. Granted not enough of the language is know yet to warrant anything really complex, but perhaps just number converter for scientific notation, or a tip calculator with code given that can make it practical to use (connect it to a website or phone application)."
2019-11-06,Ishaan k,4,1,This is a very nice start for python beginners. Professor Charles Severence's way to teaching is very good.  This course will help you build a strong foundation in python. I liked the conditional sequences lecture from other lectures. The assignments  and quize were so engrossing and tricky which helped me a lot. Moreover the discussion forum is a nice help for fellow students. I would recommend you to take this course. I completed this course in 2 days along with all assignments and quiz submitted. The bonus videos give a nice exposure about successful people and career. I also loved them.
2020-05-15,Harsh K M,4,1,"It's not as updated as python's latest version and it's sort of not possible to keep the teaching material up to date, in online courses, I was using Python 3.8.2 while learning this course and the final problem was always giving me an error telling me that "" '>' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'""
but the problem didn't show me any error on the autograder. so it's cool! and you are a very great professor, really very interesting content!"
2022-07-25,Dmitry R,4,1,Great overview to introduce Python. Good material. Good conceptual examples. Trainer is very knowledgeable. Very clear and informative course.
2020-06-29,Suprita D,4,1,"great course, some  more examples can be included"
2020-05-15,Adarsh T ,4,1,This Course is really very helpful for beginners.
2020-03-31,Tao S,4,1,good course but its more basic than i expected 
2018-08-17,Nikhil M,4,1,Nice course to have a clear idea of python
2016-02-03,John S S I,3,1,"All of the review I've read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem.  However, as I would go through the written material, I would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, I was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work.  I asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results I got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials.  One former student basically said that I should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show.  Another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased.  I decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as I have done on everything I have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983.  I have been very impressed with other courses given by Coursera members, but this one was not one of them.  All of the other submissions praise the course, so maybe it is just me, but none of the other submissions mentioned any actual things the course had done - just that it was great."
2021-04-28,C B,3,1,"This is a mixed bag of a course. While the lecturer is good, the assignments are very difficult. Do not be reassured by Dr Severance's comment that you don't need math for this course: you do. Even if it's a small amount for most, math is by far my most difficult subject and thus I was frustrated when there was no instruction for certain mathematical expressions that it seemed we were just expected to know. The moderators in the forum are vague at best but I have seen some extremely rude and patronising comments from them towards those who were struggling like myself and objected to the difficulty and assignment explanations, especially since a few of the assignments are not entirely based on the lectures. It was unclear that some information was not presented in the lectures and that we would have to use the textbook, but even the textbook seemed overly brief and not that helpful for the more difficult work. I did learn a lot, but I can see people getting frustrated with this if they are like myself and have zero background with math/coding."
2021-07-02,Nathan W,3,1,"Disappointing. Due to all these good rating, I thought this would be a really good course. My main issue with this course is that it is NOT for beginners. The videos have good production quality and the instructor is quite clear. But when it comes to trying the coding exams, the videos just dont teach you what to do. Also whats with the heavy maths for the coding exams?? Cant you just teach me the princbles of coding, not A level maths. Look somewhere else if you want to learn Python."
2022-01-11,Deleted A,3,1,"I​ understand each slide that the Professor mentioned, however when I tried to do the coding by myself, I had a hard time since the questions are in a paragraph, and writing the codes is a lot different compared with reading codes. Is it possible to dividing the coding assignments into several smaller sessions, which are ranked from the easiest to the hardest? This will help student have clear concepts. Thanks"
2022-01-02,Nicola W ,3,1,"I​ felt like this course could benefit from more examples and course work. It would have been nice to have the professor explain a concept, then we have a few small homeworks after each. The  pace of the course seemed off as well, it was very easy ands low for the first 3 weeks however from week4-7 it was warp speed. That being said, I really did love the professor, he was fun, engaging and passionate. "
2018-02-04,Chris L,3,1,"Videos are rambling at points. Also, the code assignments are 1 and done per week. This means they don't nicely build upon one another and that they can be pretty unforgiving if you aren't ready to spit out the culmination of the week's lecturers in 1 go. The course would be better with more focused lecturers and multiple short code assignments that build on one another."
2021-09-11,Syed T H R,3,1,It is a good course but the assignments are not explained in a very good manner. The programming assignments tend to get difficult due to the questions asked which are not well explained and they are a lot difficult to execute. Teaching is good but the exercises should be explained much further. 
2017-07-21,Tushar K,3,1,I feel that course should be split out for people with programming background and the first time Python programmers versus the first time programmers. There was too much repetition in some of the classes around basics of programming than python. Thanks!
2022-01-09,mohammed t,3,1,The course was great but not all the things that I'll need is in this course so I have to go on YouTube and learn more. But Anyway the course was helpful
2019-01-21,Daniel D,2,1,"I work in lesson design and blended learning teacher training. I train teachers how to combine effective teaching practices with technology in K-8 classrooms. There is lots of room for improvement in this course. I would not recommend it to someone with no experience. I have no experience in coding, and did well in this course because I went to other sources to answer my questions and fill the knowledge gaps in this course. Though the instructor was great. He seems very passionate.
From a teaching/pedagogy standpoint the scope and sequence was poor. It went from extremely broad (defining computer parts) to hyper specific (defining variables in python) really quick. There was no information between on the practical pieces of what python is, what it looks like on our computer, and how we interact with it.
It feels like multiple people got together to build the course, but after it was finished they never came back to say “Here’s where we didn’t communicate, let’s edit these things.”
There is a HUGE disconnect between writing python programs and running them vs. running the actual python platform and typing commands line by line. The most frustrating thing was that every example in the course was given as a line of code in the python platform with the chevron prompt, and every single assignment was about writing a program in the text editor and the running the program. I didn’t realize these were two completely different things until about week 6. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS. Make it clear for future students that this is a thing. Go over how to use both, and the benefits and drawbacks of each. Make it clear that your examples are taking place in the command line python platform, but our homework is writing programs and saving and running them. I didn’t understand the use of the ‘type’ function until I realized this discrepancy. This was so confusing.
Some of the quiz questions were very specific questions that were mentioned for about a second or never explicitly made clear. Some of the ideas that were emphasized or mentioned multiple times in the same lecture video (seemed important) were never asked on the quiz. I can give examples of both. 
I learned some stuff, but overall I would not recommend this course without pointing to the discrepancies. I would say there are multiple obvious areas for improvement and multiple gaps in knowledge that I filled from other sources. I could give more specific examples, but I feel like I already wrote quite a bit."
2020-09-06,Piotr B,2,1,"  To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short. It was far too basic and slow paced. Considering how little is taught, even for a beginner's course in Python, it could hardly be described as college-level material.The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate for a grade school level classroom--not something for college students or working professionals. Even if the goal were to teach those having absolutely no programming experience, the course could accomplish that while providing more content by doing the following: keep up the pace of the lectures, give better (more relevant) coding examples, and remove the portions of the lectures that are irrelevant to the course objectives.Is the course worth the price? Hell no. If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.I'm not sure about the value of all of the videos titled ""Office Hours."" They look like nothing more than self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this irrelevant two-minute video in Paris."" They're really nothing more than that.In one video, Severance corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives a polite brush-off: ""other people here would like to speak with me too."" It's obvious that Severance didn't set up the interview beforehand or warn the other person that he was going to be videotaped. Things like that make the professor look naive, unprepared, and unprofessional. After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?"" ""What was the point?"" And you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""gee, thanks for wasting my time … again.""  "
2020-09-07,Josephine W,2,1,"The teacher is likeable and the introductory videos really hooked me on the course. However, as a complete beginner, I was very put off by the way that the graded assignments had very little link to the content 'taught' in lectures. In fact, the lectures seem to ramble from one thing to another rather than having the teacher sit down and give step-by-step examples on how to code. Therefore, most of what I learnt was through the textbook that is provided for free anyway, so I may as well have taught a lot of it to myself. After the first few lectures, I stopped feeling as though I was being treated as a beginner, even though this is supposed to be 'Programming for Everybody'. Honestly, a bit of a let down."
2017-03-27,Lee D,2,1,"This course is a first time programming class using Python. This is not what I was looking for. I wanted an introduction to Python for someone who knows a some programming already. Also, this teaches Python 2, which no longer cuts it, especially for an intro class where you'll be taking further work. It may have made sense when this class was done 3 years ago. It does not now. 
The teacher was very lively and engaging, and I would enthusiastically recommend taking an online class with him, but the class is out of date and not what I was looking for. "
2019-12-13,arun k,1,1,This course is absolutely pathetic. The instructor is condescending and there is very little that you can learn from this course. The course is structured poorly. Short videos that have very little connection with the actual course material are thrown around the course structure. There is no continuity because of these videos. This is definitely not good quality material on python for beginners. Do not be deceived by the high rating of the course. You will be disappointed.
2020-06-04,Mark L,1,1,"Very brief and inadequate for a $50 investment.
I am very disappointed that the course was, surprisingly and unexpectedly cut off in the middle of the already too short beginning course. Even more cash required to continue.
 Compared to online free resources available, definitely not worth the investment.  I wish I had my money back to put to better use.
I am surprised even further by all the online positive reviews that encouraged me to start with Coursera.

2020-08-25,aravind b n E,5,0,"  Overall, this is a great introduction to Python. Prior to this class, I had zero Python experience; however, my review will be biased because not only am I a graduate of University of Michigan, but I also have 30+ years of software experience including Structured Text (CoDeSys), C, C++, C#, and a half-dozen others.Professor Severance is a great teacher – I wish I could have had him as a professor during my years at U of M.Four-point-nine-star review: because I find a few things lacking in these introductory software courses, and this one in particular.Development and debugging: line by line stepping through our code using a “better” software tool. Atom and the IDLE tools are VERY lacking in development capabilities.It is fundamental to software development to be able to step through your code, line by line, set breakpoints, and easily examine variables and values as they change. And I believe this would make it MUCH more clear to new software students exactly what a CPU is doing when processing code.I know the video course tried very hard to “sketch” out what is really going on in While loops, For loops, If-then-else statements, and function calls. However, I think that students, especially students new to software overall, would benefit greatly if they could use a more professional tool than the Atom and IDLE tools. And if that’s not possible, I think the videos should show the actual animation of stepping through line-by-line and setting breakpoints in example software, using such a tool.Visual Studio Community version is FREE online, and has all these capabilities. I’m not promoting Microsoft or this tool, other than it’s an excellent example of the types of tools students should use for really learning software. And they will benefit greatly from this experience when they evolve to the professional level.And two footnotes about Python:(a) Implicit conversion from int to float, and(b) indentation.These are my main “beefs” against Python; in the 21st century, implicit conversions should never be allowed. And the fact that Python 3 (not Python 2) implicitly converts integers to floats during mathematical operations will bar it from being an enterprise professional language. Indentation instead of braces or other blocking methods: over and over again students will be stumped as to why their code does not work because tabs and spaces are being mingled in the code. A professional language should not do that. Indeed, one must carefully make sure the settings convert tabs to spaces.  "
2020-05-26,Mutairu A  A,5,0,"DON'T GIVE UP SO SOON. KEEP ON MOVING TO COURSE 2 OF THIS SPECIALIZATION.
Sections 1-7: I had no previous knowledge about programming, even my educational background doesn't related to computer science at all. I have passion for working on the computer as a graphic designer as well as website designer, I thought I must have knowledge of programming language in order to ease my work as a website designer, but everything in this full 7 section course offers me the basic knowledge of programming with python, so nothing came as a complete surprise, that's why I mustn't quit so soon, I need to proceed to the next course to have viable workable experience in this specialization. 
This is also my first course on coursera so I did not realize until around section 3 that we were supposed to read the chapter from Charles' book (which is free) Python for Everybody: Exploring Data Using Python 3 and then view the lectures. If you have never programmed before I recommend that you read these chapters first and then watch the lectures. If you're a programmer, you can skip the reading and watch the lectures until you hit material that is more challenging and then I recommend reading the chapter and following all of the exercises for the beginners. 
In my own opinion Charles Russell Severance is a great lecturer although he somehow seems to be funny sometimes but I really interested in this course because of him. If everyone of the lecturer happen to be like him even an academic challenged individual can easily master the subject matter. All the topics of discussion were explicitly stated. All the videos were well organized in a logical manner. As the material became more difficult it became more interesting and I grew to enjoy and appreciate the down-to-earth style that Dr. Chuck has when teaching a concept in the course. I believe that he may be the person who can help me realize my dream in programming and  understand how to properly execute classes with functions in my coding.
The course was easy (I expected this), and I was only truly challenged on the last section of the course where the homework took me more than 5-10 mins to complete. Anyway, I was astonished when I got it later.
I'm looking forward to the next section of this 5 part specialization of Python for Everybody course on Coursera, where I expect to be more challenged than in the first part (Getting Started with Python).
Thanks for reading this and I hope it will be of help to you."
2016-01-12,Suyash D,5,0,"This course is a perfect one for people who are beginning to take their first steps in the world of Python (and programming, in general).. All the lectures, assignments, and the course materials offer quite good insight to basic and fundamental programming concepts..

And, considering the syntactical ease of Python, it makes programming easy to learn and understand, removing the extra clutter found in the more traditional languages like C/C++ or Java,,

And, finally, the instructor, Prof. Charles Severance, who is more affectionately called Dr. Chuck just mixes fun and learning to create quite an exciting and memorable teaching environment,

But, while all of this good, I felt that this course lacked the bite for a more advanced learner or someone who has spent sometime in the world of programming.. The complexity of the quizzes or the assignments are at beginner level... Best for complete beginners..

But, like i mentioned earlier, it is very easy to rush the whole course in a couple of days time or at most, one week for an advanced learner. 

This course lays the foundation for the more advanced courses in Python.. Technically, it is the first part of the Programming for Everybody specialization, which consists of 5 courses, revolving around the world of Python.. 

So, my final advice to all beginners is to take their sweet time understanding and grasping these fundamental concepts,, These form the foundation stone for any programming language as well as Computer Science world. Don't worry  about the assignments, you will get more than ample time to complete them and succeed in them..
Plus, I feel that you will also enjoy some of the bonus interviews.. They could be quite motivating or thought-provoking..
And, for advanced beginners, you can rush through this course and brush up on some basic concepts to move into more advanced courses, which will not only be a lot more challenging and catering more advanced and diverse concepts and topics.. 
And, in my opinion, this specialization package could be, at this current moment, the best possible experience when compared to learning the basics of Python online.. And, could be the closest thing to a face-to-face learning experience.."
2021-04-13,044_Rushabh P,5,0,"  This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to, unlike some moocs I have taken where the teachers were reading and got the intonation all wrong--very distracting. This one wasn't like that by far. He was interesting and even funny at times. The only issue I have is that if you are auditing the class, it isn't as nice an experience. You can't submit quizzes to see if you got them right and all your coding problems are marked wrong. You can still do the coding and the website will error check and all, but you won't get the pass/fail grade to be sure you got it right. I worked through all the materials, including reading the chapters in the book in just four days. I'd say there is about 2 to 4 hours of work per ""week"" expected. So, great course, but Coursera has become more interested in making money than in those of us who must only audit. It is not worth my time to chase up financial aid for something I'm working through so quickly. I'd rather spend the time working on a portfolio for future work than to bother about all that. I'm disabled, so I have no money to through at the problem. So, if you can only audit the class, is it worth it? YES! Just prepared to be highly annoyed with Coursera. The problem isn't the instructor's fault and I'm glad to have the materials. The videos covers what's in the book, but in an easy to understand way, so when you read the chapter associated with it, you can follow along without it being too dry or laborious. Then you are ready for the quiz and coding problem(s), and then a little wrap up material before moving on to the next lesson. I'm glad we are allowed to work ahead. I'm moving on to the second course in the specialization, which picks up where this one left off. If you want to learn Python or just ""a"" programing language to get a start or just dabble in programming, this is a great place to start!  "

2020-02-17,Wenjing L,5,0,"I'd like to say this is the MOST AMAZING programming course I've taken.



I have been trying to learn programming since I was in primary school (OK and now I am a high school graduate). Through the years I've learned Scratch, C++ and a couple of other things at school that I don't remember. But the problem was, all those teachers were going way too fast for a beginner like me to understand the whole thing. They also presumed that I understood their logic, but in reality I couldn't. So I only had to remember the ""codes"" and copy them from my brain onto exams. Then a few months later, I'd forget them.



But Dr. Chuck's course is amazing, literally amazing. His pace of teaching was just the perfect tempo for me, not too fast so as to get the whole picture and get things organized, and not too slow to waste time. I think he did an excellent job in illustrating the whole logic of the codes we've learned. Also as a programmer for many years, he had many small tips for us beginners (like how to find the same file in both Atom and Python) that are really useful but are not included in typical textbooks. He is also very humorous and listening to his course is nothing but boring. The funny little videos in Bonus part were also relaxing.



And I think the quiz and homework system in Coursera worked pretty well with the lectures. It gave me chances to check my progress, and pointed out the small things I missed in the lectures. I also like the forum where we can ask questions and see how hundreds of other students throughout the world are learning with me. The whole system made my learning very efficient.



Since I am just a new comer to programming, I can't pick out some technical problems of the course design. I've seen many comments saying how the course lacked some basic points, and I think they might be true. However, from my point of view, I am really satisfied with how much I successfully learned in such a short course, and I am really grateful for Dr. Chuck and Coursera for providing such a wonderful educational experience.

2017-01-15,Adenine K S H,5,0,"Majoring in Genetics and Molecular Biology, I were fortunate enough to meet one of my lecturer who works primarily on Next Generation Sequencing and its downstream analysis. Knowing the importance of how computer science will be in the near future and its power, he urges us to learn about programming and suggests us to extend our semester to take some programming courses from my university. It was the first time I heard about those words: Linux, big data, programming languages such as Java, Python et cetera. 
I started searching about some summer courses in my university and also other part time courses from other universities in my countries, but none of them is satisfactory. And then I found coursera, and decided to register for this course - Programming for Everybody. It is really a great solution, I don't have to extend my semester, I can learn something so useful to my major yet it is not included in my own course program, and most importantly, I can learn whenever I am free and proceed in my own pace. In this way I find it easier to figure out things which I am confused of and clear them out before I think I am ready for the next.
Dr. Chuck is indeed one of the most inspiring and encouraging lecturer I have ever met. Clear explanation, and step by step guidance, he clears all doubts in an interesting way. It is his humour that helps me to remember things. Programming can be boring and dull, it is so technical, imagine that you have to follow a certain number of rules to talk to someone, but Dr. Chuck makes sense out of it (I still remember the first lecture: while you think you are joking with python, it says syntax error). 
As my first programming course, I really learn a lot from Dr. Chuck, a lot more than I expected to. I truly appreciate all the efforts made by Dr. Chuck and his teams, and also, the teams behind Coursera. Thank you."
2018-04-23,Meesun K,5,0,"If anyone is unsure where and how to start and feel like they aren't very ""tech-savvy"", this class is the place to start.  Best Computer Science intro class I had taken without the pressure of learning the more technical stuff.  Professor Severance introduced coding with very simple and layman terms.  I came in hesitant and unsure if coding was within my reach, and after taking his course I am not only amazed with how much I was able to understand, but am looking forward to learning more.  His lectures are easy,  short and to-the-point, no computer jargon or overly complicated terms.  And the assignments push you enough to really understand the new concepts he is teaching.  Rather than just coding, he is teaching us to to be hyper-aware of our writing, how a computer interprets it and its affect in the end result in our code.  If he is teaching any other classes in Python I will definitely take them.  If not, I feel like I have a solid foundation to continue my self studies.  I was very lost where to begin in my desire to learning coding.  
Thank you very much Professor Severance, your passion and desire for people to learn coding through Python shines through this course.  I appreciate your effort to make learning such a foreign area of study (to most people) much more approachable, and even coming alongside in sympathizing with our frustrations.  Learning something new is difficult, but having a teacher who understands this and wants to help the student is beyond what a student can ask for of his/her teacher.
Again if you have had a desire to learn coding and thought it was impossible, feeling lost going through all the different youtube videos and forums.  Take this course!  It'll give you that basic foundation in learning to code without being overwhelmed by technical jargon."

And as expected this course is far more better than my expectation and the Instructor of this course is really very good.  

Charles Severance is one of the best teacher on online platform, I go through, really enjoyed the way he taught to us. His techniques, his way of teaching is something which makes him unique, and may be that's the reason most of student enjoy to attend hi course. I love the way he start teaching from the scratch and cover almost everything which is either required for course or essential for us. I have completed this seven week course  in just within two weeks because I loved the way Professor Charles Severance teaches.

I am glad to attend this course and looking forward to attend the further courses by Doctor Charles Severance, continuing  this series of Python learning.  At last I would like to suggest all of aspirants want to learn python to go though  this course at least once. 

I loved various blogs in the end of every weeks either it is interview of any one or just a fun blog of office tours of Bangalore, Paris, Milan ,Seoul etc.

At last I wanna to thanks Coursera for providing this course to us and I would also like to thanks  Michigan University for providing this course to us . Thank you Coursera and thanks to Michigan University to providing us such a wonderful  course.

If you are a quick learner, you can sometimes complete a course within the trial phase (and thus possibly even receive a certificate for free!).Some (not all) of thePersonal Development / Career courseshave been criticized by users as being rather superficial. Anyone who is already working and has an academic degree may not learn much in some of these courses.A clear advantage over other course platforms is theeasy navigationwithin courses. Videos, tests, discussion forums and further reading materials are easily accessible.For some courses, a final exam with an assessment by other students is required (Peer Assessment). This often works well, but for smaller courses with fewer participants, it may take some time to get adequate feedback for your work.  "
2020-10-23,Srimathi B,5,0,"When I
started this course I had a very little knowledge about programming. Frankly
when I started to do the first lesson, I felt very nervous thinking whether I was
able to complete this because this is my first programming course that I ever
took.  Today, I am very happy that I was
able to successfully finished the course making me adequately enough individual
to write a simple block of code in Python. I believe this is all due to the way
and the amount of course material provided in this course.  Videos are not too long or too short.  The length of all the videos are just right.  I simply cannot resist to mention I love the instructor’s
writings on  slides/screen.  Those writings really helped me to understand
theories and concepts of each lesson.  Besides,
those made me to feel that I was in an actual classroom. 
 
Text
book is written in very simple, clear and concise English making me to read
whole chapter after each lesson without getting distracted or bored. The exercises
provided at the end of each chapter are appropriate and gave me a chance to
practice the concepts that  I have already
learnt.  
 
The amount
of course material provided for each lesson was just right for me.  That is why I was able to absorb the material
very easily and also was able to meet all the deadlines on time. 
 
I have
become unemployed due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.  This course helped me greatly to engage myself
and learn a new skill during this difficult and stressful time.  This inspired me to take more programming courses
 in the future.  Thank you Dr. Severance!!  Thanks so much for offering
this course in Coursera !!! "
2020-05-02,Muhammad u F,5,0,"by Brandt completed this course, spending 1 hours a week on it and found the course difficulty to be very easy.

This is the first class in the new (at the time I took it) Python for Everybody specialization, which grew out of Dr. Charles Severence's popular course of the same name. As I understand it, the first two courses of this specialization will cover the material from the previous course, while the third and fourth courses and the capstone will cover new material.



This is a very gentle introduction to programming in Python. The videos are very thorough, and Dr. Chuck does a good job of going over everything he's teaching in great detail. As I had a fair amount of experience in R and some experience with Python (Codecademy course and Genomic Data Science with Python course), I found this to be very easy, and I raced through the class in a few hours, listening to the videos on 2x speed. One of the big problems I have with this course and similar ones (like the Rice Python courses) is the use of web-based coding platforms. While they're useful for real-time checking of code, students who learn to use these platforms may end up completely lost if they try to go apply their programming experience from these courses to a real-world problem. I would much prefer to see programming taught via command line or using an IDE like Spyder.



Overall, four stars. Very thorough, very slow-paced. I imagine that finishing this specialization will only get students to the novice programmer stage, but it is a good first step, and probably the most approachable programming course out there for those with no experience."
2022-07-14,Derrick R M,5,0,"Best Introduction to Python introductory course I have ever taken. I had taken python at University over a year ago in my second year but I had never really grasped the syntax and meaning of it all , and i never really liked the random youtube tutorials with no assignmets. I took this course due to my recent interest in Machine learning and Data Science. I was able to take it from the beginning, completeall the quizes and assignments all in one day with a few breaks here and there!. Most coding  assignments were really simple and they give you a starting code from where to build on. The last Coding assignent (Week 7) was simple but needed one to first understand what exactly is needed, you can re-watch the while loops video again if needed. It took me a little bit more time  compared to the rest which I finished in just minutes on average. I had to rest a little bit and come back to it as I had taken the whole course in one sitting. Here Dr. Severance does a very good job of explaining in avery clear and structured manner. I've got to complete the rest of the courses in the specialization. Assignments did a good job of re-enforcing what I have studied. There's no clearly and easily explained python introductory course with practice coding questions you gonna find on the Internet better than this one. Highly recommended for a complete beginner.  If you're passed the beginner level, this course won't be of very much use though."
2020-06-17,19I1970 S M K,5,0,"     My online classes are a convenience for me. They allow me to take additional classes that would not have fit into my schedule otherwise. I am not a traditional student, so I have non-traditional needs. Internet classes allow me to remain at home with my family. Taking Internet classes has many advantages for a non-traditional, and traditional student, such as: saving money, saving time, and most of all the convenience. Internet classes are the answer for many students with non-traditional needs. However, the only downfall to my Internet class was a computer virus, which was disastrous. I lost everything on my computer, but as for the important files I had backup on floppies. I was lucky, my sister-in-law came within a few days and fixed my computer, so I did not get too far behind. This situation should be considered when taking an Internet class.    In my experience with Internet classes, the good far outweigh the bad. Taking Internet classes has saved me money. If I were taking traditional classes,  I would be spending about twenty dollars a week in gas alone, not to mention the wear and tear on my car. The only expense that I incur with Internet classes is my server charge, which is about twenty-five dollars a month. That means by taking Internet classes I am saving over eighty dollars a month, and that does not include wear and tear on my car. I could finance a new computer with the savings from taking online classes.  "
2019-09-05,Rahul K,5,0,"This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to, unlike some moocs I have taken where the teachers were reading and got the intonation all wrong--very distracting. This one wasn't like that by far. He was interesting and even funny at times. The only issue I have is that if you are auditing the class, it isn't as nice an experience. You can't submit quizzes to see if you got them right and all your coding problems are marked wrong. You can still do the coding and the website will error check and all, but you won't get the pass/fail grade to be sure you got it right. 

The videos covers what's in the book, but in an easy to understand way, so when you read the chapter associated with it, you can follow along without it being too dry or laborious. Then you are ready for the quiz and coding problem(s), and then a little wrap up material before moving on to the next lesson. I'm glad we are allowed to work ahead. I'm moving on to the second course in the specialization, which picks up where this one left off. If you want to learn Python or just ""a"" programming language to get a start or just dabble in programming, this is a great place to start!

2017-10-10,Charlie R,5,0,"I like this program mucho!  Yes, you can learn Python from a book or from an automated, text-based course.  But the videos by Dr. Chuck give the course the human touch and a real-world college feel.  With a human in the loop,  slight and useful nuances of coding and perspective on coding come through subtly and informally, beyond what text alone can provide. -- My only hangup was with the Autograder, the automated checker of submitted programs.  For the final program I delivered output as required.  My code was syntactically and semantically correct.  However I had to rewrite my code several times to fit the hidden requirements of the tool.  That was frustrating.  To resolve the problem I went to the Forum and received prompt feedback on my efforts.  Again, the human support aspect of Coursera distinguishes it from other tools.  On the way to resolution, I did get feedback on alternate and cleaner ways to code.  Thanks very much to those that monitored and respond to the forum.  -- I am VERY HAPPY with my experience with Coursera and this course.  I am very excited:  I feel empowered and confident that I can achieve my goals of not only acquiring a good, basic foundation of programming (Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.) but continue to advanced and current topics (Machine Learning, Big Data, etc.)  Thanks to all!"
2020-11-05,Wilfried K,5,0,"This is the first python course that I take. Before that, I had already taken a course in VBA programming(also from the university of Michigan via Coursera). So the notions were not new to me.At first, I found the contents of the chapters 1 and 2 boring and I wanted to do something more advanced like statistics with Python. After struggling and failing at all my attempts to escape the basics of the language, I decided to come back to this course and I finished it. Here are my remarks :*The course is really well organized and suited to a beginner's need because the key concepts of any programming language are explained once at a time. There are also small assignments to allow the students to better familiarize with the concept.*The quizzes and assignments are clearly aligned with the concept studied, which facilitates the finding and correction of mistakes, thus allowing the student to build confidence.*The subtleties pertaining to each concept , especially conditional execution and functions are clearly explained and reviwed in the quizzes and programming assignments.*You will learn how to access your file by referring to its directory using the command prompt, which is unique.

2020-06-22,siddhant t,5,0,"  The Python playground is amazing, but it isn't even necessary because the instructor provides such great material for getting Python installed and running on your computer (with windows, mac, and linux instructions), even a complete beginner would be able to follow the instructions and make a functioning script in no time. But the playground is just a lot of fun to play with, and makes tinkering as a beginner super easy.I spent one whole day and finished the entire Getting Started with Python course (auditing, quizzes), and learned more than I learned in the first 4 weeks of a 6 week paid course. Dr. Chuck is GOOD at what he does. He presents material in a very down-to-earth manner in clear, plain language that's technical, but not over my head. I have very little experience with programming, and know the basics of computers and computing, but even the introduction to hardware architecture was fascinating and I learned more about hardware than I expected. I felt a lot more prepared to dive into programming after that lecture.The amazing thing is that so much is crammed into such short lectures, and yet the material is still accessible.  "
2018-03-04,Gaute M F,5,0,"This is a review of the first og five parts in the Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python. It deserves 5 stars. The video tutorials are great and informative and the course also includes PowerPoint slides used in the lectures, the complete book which can be downloaded, quizzes and assignments, an autograder for the assignments and a playground where you can try out your Python skills and examples covered in the lectures. And, even though I haven't used it, a discussion group categorized in weeks (for the different topics covered), where both students and staff are very active. There really isn't a negative side, but if I where to mention something, it would be that I am guessing the PowerPoint slides originally where used for Python 2.7, because some of them have not been updated all the way, to Python 3. And, even though some of the quiz questions are very simple, some harder questions should be available, to make us prepare more. And of course, a few more assignments per week would help boost our confidence, even though I know we could do that on our own. Great course and great teacher."
2020-11-07,"Kelly, F",5,0,"This course is a super introduction to Python programming, especially if you have little or no prior programming experience. 

I took othe course for two reeasons:
i) To keep myself occupied during Covid lockdown 2.0 in Ireland and;
ii) To do a course that was outside of my comfort zone.

The lectures are delivered in a ligical manner with the content being easy to understand.
The quizes check your understanding of each lecture. I recommend that you complete the quizes as soon as you finsh the lecture while the content is 'fresh' in your mind.
The assignments can be challenging; for me; it took a few attempts to get them right. Sometime, it's easy to forget all the syntax requirements. that said, as you complete each assignemnt, your confidence builds up. If at first you struggle with an assignment, leave it for a few hours or a day, then, come back to it. While I did not use them regularly, the online forums are a useful source of encouragement with other students.
In conclusion, a well-designed Python programming course that is easy follow and build up your confidence with Python. "
2020-04-25,NAVEEN K,5,0,"First off, let me say that this course is excellent. I've been interested in learning to program for a few months now. I tried things like Codecademy and Code School -- and while I learned a little bit from each of them, Python for Everybody was the key to my success of finally grasping the language.



There are a few reasons for this:



1. Dr. Chuck is awesome! His lessons are light-hearted, thorough, and truly make programming fun. He is the type of professor who is doing this for the love of Python and that really stands out.



2. This course encourages you to work in your own environment. While being able to learn to code in a browser is fun and interesting...using your own machine and your own terminal to execute Python is essential. Plus, you feel like a real programmer! Which really is cool when you're just starting out. It gives you the motivation to keep going. It did for me anyway.



If you're on the fence about this course, take it from another developer-in-training. Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody is one of the best classes I've ever taken. You'll be glad you did."
2017-08-10,jen,5,0,"I learned more in this course than the introductory course I paid for through a private company. The assignments are practical and helpful, and most of all: Dr. Chuck is truly amazing. He presents technical information in a clear way using plain language, and makes it easy to pick up the Python lingo (and programming lingo in general). He is a clear speaker who doesn't talk too fast, and his teaching slides are helpful and easy to follow. The interactive transcripts and closed captioning are high quality and extremely helpful. This class was so great that I decided to sign up (pay) for the full specialization program.
I whizzed through all the course materials in a day, but I had a (very) little bit of introductory experience before coming to this course. I believe someone without any programming experience whatsoever could comfortably complete this course well within the suggested time frame.
Honestly I can't believe it doesn't cost anything to take (audit) a course of this caliber. If you're considering taking this class, I don't think you'll regret it."
2018-06-21,Sofia A,5,0,"Dr Chuck is amazing! He can make you understand all you need to know without any previous knowledge. All the open-sourced material is very helpful too and the exercises are spot-on, perfect for revision and for testing your knowledge. I read several comments from people who were already familiar with programming, saying that for them this course is pretty basic. I would like to share my understanding of the matter, having finished the first part of the specialisation. This course is an introduction to programming, for EVERYONE. This means that it has to build up from scratch assuming that the student has no idea even what is inside a computer! And it achieves it perfectly. So, I recommend this course for everyone that want's to get started on Python; don't be intimidated, you can learn how to do this because this is an excellent step-by-step approach. You will learn same as you learned how to speak English. And I also recommend it for everyone who knows how to program already and would like to touch-base and put things back into context."
2017-06-10,Luke L,5,0,"This introductory course in Python was great, overall I found the instructor (Charles Severance) to be an excellent Lecturer. He has a wealth of experience and a great personality which helped motivate me a lot. 
If I think back throughout the 7 weeks, knowing what I had ahead of me from one week to the next, it sometimes felt daunting not knowing what might be expected of me in the next class or section of the course.  Then..before you know it..Charles is back and at a click of a button..explaining everything you need to know with excellent examples of code (what to do, what not do do etc) and reference to additional resources to dip in and out of, to help bolster my understanding, push me out of my comfort zone and complete the assignments.
This really is one of the best software engineering classes I could find.  Charles is an excellent lecturer, mentor and coach and really knows how to help get you started and most of all, get you through it! 
I seriously can't wait to start my next Coursera course ""Python Data Structures"" - Enjoy!"
2021-01-07,Hui C H J,5,0,"I have greatly enjoyed learning python with Prof Chuck. The videos and textbook provide examples that are easy for me to follow. I can go at my own pace and just have to make sure to submit quizzes and homework assignments on time. The quizzes were a good way for me to gauge my understanding of the weekly lessons. As long as you understand the material then the homework assignments aren't too bad. Also, reading the chapter after watching all the weekly videos  plus doing the exercises at the end of each chapter was a great way to prep for the quizzes.



I wasn't sure if I would understand python since I had trouble learning C++ in the past and thought this might be too hard to learn. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I started to understand things and put the pieces together to create my programs. I plan to complete the remaining 4 classes to get the python certification.



This was a very good learning experience and I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn python. Thank you Prof Chuck. "
2020-08-20,Nikolay K,5,0,"Charles Severance is a truly magician.

All my life I evaded programming, always had negative experience throughout the entire School and University, achieved only C's and hated it.
But Charles took it all and put upside down — programming is Fun! The course is ideally clear and so well structured and balanced, so it is not an iota worse than your favourite TV show! Albeit with one little, but a very crucial difference — you learn REALLY USEFUL THINGS.
And anyone can learn it, for sure. The course requires no special talent or knowledge, it just gives you them both, if you honestly complete all tasks with full dedication. It inspires you to create and program. 
It's absolutely true that in the middle of the XXI century there will be two types of people — algorithm makers and algorithm executes. So if you want to have an impact in your future life, ENROLL! 
P.S. But the real fruits await you after the completion of the course.

I loved this course.With so many glowing reviews, I don't think mine matters, but here it is anyway: This course is amazing.



This course is so amazing that a) I realized I threw away way too much money on a different ""introduction to python"" course that had live instructors and one-on-one access to mentors because this class was free and far more beneficial; and b) when I'm done writing this review, I'm going to sign up for the whole Coursera Python for Everybody specialization.



The amazing thing is that so much is crammed into such short lectures, and yet the material is still accessible.



Speaking of accessibility: the lectures have captions AND interactive transcripts. The audio is crisp and clear, as is the video-- without background noise or distractions. The dedication to accessibility has blown me away and is another big reason I plan to support Coursera by paying for the specialization path."
2020-08-21,AKSHAJ K,5,0,"This was my first online course ever. New to the world of online courses, I immediately fell in love with it within the first 2-3 weeks (which I completed within a day) of the course. I am really starting to see the potential of online learning and how this particular course makes it so easy for students from any background whatsoever to get starter with Python programming. I myself being a student of computer science and having learnt C++ found it very lucrative to speed through some of the portions of the course (the playback speed feature is really handy) and at the end of each week I could reinforce my learning through the assignments and reviews. Also liked the concept of Peer Graded Assignments and how it boosts the peer learning process in some ways. The video lectures by Dr. Charles Severance are really good and on-point, guiding the student across various circumstances of a particular topic. Will continue with the specialisation courses offered by University of Michigan on PY4E. 10/10."
2019-06-13,Madhan K,5,0,"  I started this course having zero knowledge about python software. I had learnt c++ in my school days so i started to grasp the concepts quickly without much difficulty. I am really happy that this online course has proper assignments and quizzes to test our knowledge instead of just having to learn the concepts. A huge thanks to Prof. Charles Severance for making this course seem easy to learn. His way of teaching is very unique and i feel lucky to have got him as the instructor in an online learning platform. Anybody without a prior knowledge about programming can learn this course by taking their time. This course has been planned correctly and adequately instead of rushing with loads of concepts. In a way this course provides time for the individuals to learn, practice, and correct their mistakes while programming. In case of any difficulties, there are forums where we can discuss about the problems and get a solution. I eagerly look forward for my upcoming courses on this specialization."
2018-03-19,Neel C,5,0,"Programmers using complex lingo in your life making you feel lost when they explain something to you?
This is the course for you! 
Other resources you tried on how to program are too complicated, and sound like an alien is speaking to you?
 This is the course for you! 
Why? 
Everything is explained so ""Everybody"" (anybody!) can learn! Plus, everything is communicated slowly, and compared to things in everyday life (of that of the ""99%"" of the population) so that ""Everybody"" can understand. 
Note: Great for LEARNING the basics. Not for PRACTICING. I used this course alongside ""Learning Python the Hard Way"" since that is an exercise only focused book, and this course is strong in terms of it's ability to communicate complicated concepts.
Also, if you are someone in the tech industry who thinks his explanations are too ""dumbed down"", take this as a chance to learn and improve your own communication skills by watching someone who is able to communicate ""complex ideas"" so that ""Everybody"" can understand.

Charles Severance is a marvelous teacher! I felt as he really understood where am I coming from as a non-technical student that never touched a piece of code before. And that shouldn't be forgotten! The course progress is nice and in a good paste (some might say even too slow) giving you the time to deal with this new world as it's not letting you feel that you are too slow to learn. I know that I acquired the most basic understanding of Python. Which was exactly what I wanted! With that knowledge, I believe I have the infrastructure to keep learning independently or at list was encouraged to deal with my fears. Now, I feel much more confident and sure I will continue to learn. Thank you so much!"
2020-11-29,Hank E,5,0,"Course is easy to understand and Dr. Chuck works the examples in such as way as to make the solution appear obvious. There are many ways to write a program to solve a problem. Efficiently writing the program such that it actually takes less computer time is something that is difficult to each. Computers work well doing iterative tasks that with fast processors, we do consider how efficient our coding is. In the old days of the cold war when processing power was a competitive and under export control, the Soviet Union which lacked equivalent processor power learned to write code that was very efficient. Hence when the Soviet Union fell, Soviet (Russian) programmer were in high demand by western software companies. Some western software companies even set up research labs in Russia to take advantage of the pool of talented programmers.
I will take a bit of time to think in programming language again to write efficient code in Python. Thank you for this first course.

RECOMMENDED to all, specially NEWBIES wishing and willing to learn PYTHON.
First of all, I would like to extend my heartful thanks to the course instructor Dr. Charles, Coursera and all the supporting team members who contributed immensely in creating such a wonderfully planned Course structure for Newbies like me.
I really loved:
1. The simple way in which the content was explained.
2. The additional videos (be it of Dr. Charles office hours or with Mr. Python (Guido van Rossum Sir) or others like the Co-Founder of Coursera and the Piazza one were quite inspiring). All these provided an insight and sparked that you need to be more passionate and even more dedicated towards transforming your passion into your profession.
3. I was aware of the basics of C++. However, I feel the way you have explained everything, even the person with zero programming background can even understand it.
I am excited and looking forward to complete the whole Specialization."
2020-07-08,V V D P A,5,0,"  This is the best course for the beginners especially for those who do not have any idea about coding. It is user-friendly and it won't take much time for anyone of you to complete this course. The instructor for this course is absolutely phenomenal his teaching is spectacular you will get easily involved with him throughout the course, he often cracks nice jokes hahaha, so he has a nice sense of humor to lower down the pressure build-up (only if it happens), well he will just keep u on track throughout the course while u often try to loose while watching the examples he shows during the video sessions, so that's great, keeps u motivated. So, in the last I say have FUN guys u will enjoy it absolutely no doubt at all, its a full wonderful treat, for more things why not try it out yourself only if u feel that yeah this language will come handy for me in the future. So have fun and stay blessed. Thank u and I pray that u and your family have a very good life.  "

The foundational knowledge and skills this course passes on is solid,  essential, and prepares for future learning very well.  No computer background required for this at all.   I also commend the Dr. , for his ability to simplify the concepts without teaching anything which is untrue.  You won't need to unlearn anything you learn here as you continue to advance.  It's all good stuff, and I appreciated a little bit of the trivia.   I can tell this is an old course given some of the bonus videos of historical nature were recorded a few years ago.... but I'm doing it in 2018, but it's still relevant.  I appreciate that I do not need to wait for a session to start, and there are plenty of peers still doing this course.  You can do this at your own pace, and won't need to wait long at all for any peer review."

This course will give you a great introduction to Python as well as the skills necessary to take other courses. The pace of the course is just right so you will be challenged and motivated until the end. Furthermore,  you will receive a lot of support from the Professor as well as the community so whenever you get stuck, there will be a lot of people helping you understand the problem your are having. The Professor, Dr. Chuck, is extremely engaged, motivating and passionate about enabling people around the world to learn programming skills. He participates in the course and forums, making the long distance learning more personal and exciting. I strongly recommend this course for beginners - if you are afraid of starting a programming course because you do not know whether you will be able to learn, go ahead, enrol and have fun!"
2020-02-17,Dan-Alexandru A,5,0,"  This is a great introduction to Python. Everything is taken step by step and the Python-specific topics are very clearly explained. I found that valuable. However, I would say that this course is not really for everybody, but for those with absolutely no experience in coding in any other language. Prof. Severance takes a lot of time to explain fundamental concepts which are virtually the same regardless of the language one is using. I studied C++ during my highschool years, more than 12 years ago. Moreover, I have used Matlab quite extensively as well as a bit of VBA during my BSc and MSc (more than 7 years ago) and a little bit of both during my work years. In that respect, the time Prof. Severance takes to explain the mechanics of the algorithms was a bit of a waste. Maybe the book would be the better option for those who can move through the material faster.Overall: very clear, very well structured, a bit too slow.  "
2022-05-08,Raffaele L,5,0,"For someone who is new to python and has no experience with computer programming, this course has been an excellent introduction to coding with python.  I highly recommend taking this course, especially if you are like myself and come from a non-computer science major/background.  It was very interesting and I was able to learn at my own pace, contrasting the experience with traditional college or universities; this really allowed me to grasp the concepts and learn them for the sake of learning them rather than for fear of negatively impacting my GPA.  Dr. Charles Severance is a fantastic professor, and his teaching style is far better than most of the professors that I 
have had during my time at University; he actually seems to care about your success and whether 
you learn the content rather than treating you as a number like most university profs do.  

I highly recommend this class.  You will not regret it."
2017-03-06,Kainka,5,0,"It's a great introduction to programming and Python 2 specifically. The way Dr. Chuck explains every step proving it's all doable is very encouraging for those of us who may think that programming is far beyond their competences. It's also a very good course for those who either had learned some Python elsewhere, or know other programming language as it organizes everything in a comprehensive manner so it all does make a lot of sense :) Dr. Chuck provides a free book ""Python for Informatics"" which is a very good reference of the key Python things with real case scenarios targeted at exploring information that anyone of us an use rather than sorting and other algorithms which are more suitable for computer science students. This course covers chapters 1-5 of this book so it's more of getting started with Python while the following courses continue with the next chapters when things are getting very exciting."
2020-04-09,Anish A,5,0,"I had started this course because I had no knowledge regarding Python, even though I had knowledge of other languages like C, C++, Java, C# & Swift. Coming from someone who has had a decent amount of programming knowledge, I must say that Dr. Chuck is one of the best instructors I've come across and his courses are well paced, informative & not overwhelming. The quizzes & the assignments in his courses are both doable by anyone who is just starting out and through his style of teaching I must say that anyone, literally anyone with no knowledge of programming or computer science can get into this field.
In conclusion, if you are someone looking for a Python course which is simple yet dives into the depths without the fear of overwhelming you with lots of lessons, I suggest you take this course, and you will find yourself gaining more knowledge at a much rapid rate through Dr. Chuck than any other instructor."
2015-11-03,Jade T,5,0,"I'd been intimidated by python for awhile, despite having experience in other programming languages.  This was a really good introduction for a beginner and made digesting the blocks incredibly easy.  Another great benefit of the course is the extensive media through which you can access the information for the course.  Video, the textbook and even podcasts (which I have listened to on bike rides); Dr. Severance clearly wants to make the information as accessible as possible. Additionally, Dr. Severance is incredibly personable and funny.  I would love to have him as a professor.  
My one complaint with the course would be that it moves really slow if you already have any coding experience.  To give you an idea, I have a background in R and got through this course in 2 days.  Either way, I'm on to the next course in the series and will continue on with the rest of them.  
Thank you, Dr. Severance!"
2017-09-29,Muhammad A B,5,0,"This is the first online course in which I've enrolled.  Before stepping my feet into COURSEA's  course (Programming for Everybody) I tried my level best to learn Python but never went beyond ""if/elif/else"" but after taking this course though I'm in the middle of it but I can proudly say that I've crossed my previous milestone & a new horizon has rose in front of me. InshAllah I will go beyond that horizon. 
I am a bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Studies in English Language (HONS)) holder but this is the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole 16 years of education career.
Thanks COURSERA for providing such a marvelous opportunity and courses along with perfectly modified course outlines and study related content to students who previously never got exposed to what they want to learn on COURSERA. This is such a wonderful platform for every beginner. 


Thanks COURSERA, I owe you. "
2016-10-01,Muktai K B,5,0,"It was my first programming experience in my life!! I would like to honestly mention here that I had some doubts and insecurities about overall difficulty level and few other things of the "" Learning Programming Languages"" and whether I would be able to do it successfully or not sort of things. But I m very glad to state that this course really helped me a lot to get over this fear and to obtain an excellent grade. It guided me even how one should think while learning a programming language. Dr. Severance was more than helpful and kind to guide us during this whole learning process. I believe he has successfully understood the mindset of newbies and is encouraging. Overall, I feel very positive and I am going join next Course as well. 
Thank you Coursera for all the facilities and thank you very very much Dr. Charles Severance for conducting this great course. Good luck!!

2021-01-15,Myra R,5,0,"I would like to be able to learn and obtain a list of all operators to develop skills in setting up an argument, for different applications. All in all, this was a great first experience. I wish there was more emphasis on the operators and how to use them through example, and emphases on opening statements and closing statements because learning indentations follow,  and the book with an answer key would have helped. A student needs to develop the skill in seeing how these things work first and develop their own instead of creating a code from scratch... just my opinion based on the degree of difficulty I encountered in this course. Great job and thank you for allowing underserved students and professionals afford education through Coursera. Very grateful for this class, the instructor Mr. Severance, UM and Coursera for making learning during this pandemic possible. "
2020-05-14,Benjamin S,5,0,"I am a Junior pursuing a computer science degree at another university, but I figured I wouldn't be doing much Python in my degree and I wanted to use my skills to pursue a personal interest in data science. I found this first course to be a fantastic introduction to Python and a solid overview of Python specific syntax and 'quirks' (such as the emphasis on indentation), which is primarily the knowledge I was lacking as opposed to general programming concepts, which I was very familiar with. I can imagine that this course is extremely valuable for beginners, because the professor does a wonderful job of explaining some rather abstract programming concepts in an accessible, structured, and clear way. I also think he hints how certain practices are good coding habits and help with clarity and conciseness of code, which I also think is extremely useful for beginners."
2020-08-10,Debashish B,5,0,"This course is a steppingstone of my interest in a programming language. Personally, I am not a fan of any programming languages. However, after browsing through many reviews, I thought to give it a try. Guess what! I was not disappointed. The course material is well organized, and I felt the instructor of this course is very knowledgeable.
He has an immense idea about the struggle a student may face while learning
this course. He literally making this course accessible for everyone.
Generally, other online courses, instructors expect a student to have a prior
background on the topics they are going to teach, which is not always the case.
Sometimes, the course materials are difficult to understand as well. This course can be a perfect example for other online courses on how to present
effectively a relatively difficult topic to the beginner students. Great job!"
2019-07-24,Беха Т,5,0,"I really enjoyed the course and found programming very exciting. The particularly exciting part was when I was able to apply what I learned, for example, I played around making programs to execute some physics formulas when some unknowns are inputted (I wish I had this knowledge last year my physics lab reports demanding the same calculations to be made repetitively would be considerably less time consuming). 

It was relatively easy to complete the course not only because it's a beginner's course but also because it is thoroughly explained making it easy to follow so I didn't have moments when I was stuck in trying to understand something. Also, the python playground tasks were very helpful and I wish there were more of those. Since those tasks forced me to truly engage with python and learn how to use it. Regardless, I think the course deserves 5 stars. "
2016-01-09,Michał T,5,0,"This is something really great and I appreciate all the efforts of the creators of that course, especially Dr. Charles Severance, who has an amazing ability of imparting his knowledge in a very colourful and enjoyable way, while fully substantively and clearly.
This is my first ever on-line course, and if the remaining parts are conducted in similar way, I am more than impatient to start it immediately. It is a pity, it is 3:54 AM... :)
And one more thing - this course as well as the book is indeed for the very beginners however with some ability of logical thinking (if you are not such a very beginner it will take just couple of days to finish it, as it was in my case).
So listen carefully what Dr. Chuck is saying, read the book, take look at the slides, and other available stuff and don't hesitate to start and don't give up if something goes wrong.
 

"
2017-01-04,noor,5,0,"Awesome Class! I'm currently studying mechanical engineering but I want to work in more of a mechatronics position when I graduate so I decided to take this course as an introduction to programming. I am completely new to this area of study (before this course, the most ""programming"" I've done is in excel). As a novice, I like how easy the course was to follow. Other courses I have taken were too overwhelming - too much information was thrown at us at once. This course assumes you have no working knowledge of the subject and appropriately exposes you to the basics. I also loved the book; it was such an easy read. Sometimes not enough information was given in the chapter so you will need to look up supplemental material but all this is provided with the course. Dr. Chuck keeps the classes fun and interesting. You can tell he loves what he does. "
2020-10-01,Jennifer B,5,0,"I'm a complete beginner at Python, (32 year old medical doctor) and I had lots of recommendations about how to learn and what courses.  It is really hard to decide.  I did take advantage of a free week of Dataquest but I have come back to Coursera and am now paying for the course.  Some other platforms might look shiny but they build too quickly, if you are completely new at programming it really needs to be this simple because it's a hard skill to learn, and I also think the order of the lessons makes the most sense.  Having the videos and the book is really helpful.  I'm not planning on a career change, this is just for fun (although I also do medical research so I hope I will use it for that), so we'll see how far I get but I really hope ""Dr Chuck"" is proud of creating this.  I'll be recommending it as the Python beginner course of choice."
2021-01-14,Thomas I,5,0,"Fo someone whose last programming course was in 9th grade over half a century I found this to be a good intro course.  It starts off easy and gradually becomes more complex.  I found the last couple of assignments to be challenging but rewarding.  If you find yourself stuck, looking over other students questions and responses to them from the tutors will reassure you that you're not alone, and may provide clues as to whether you are on the right track, and of course, it always help to read and refer to the book which is freely available online.  I found ""Dr. Chuck"" to be an encouraging and engaging presence, who communicates enough of the material in his videos to give you a beginner's confidence but to complete the last couple of assignments, unless you have a natural gift for thinking like a programmer, it may helps to refer to the book.

 "
2019-05-02,Siva L K N,5,0,"It is a very nice course, easy to understand the basics and the logic of programming as well. I really liked the way the course is structured, it is easy for even those who are new to programming.
The course material is good and so are the lectures. I am postdoc in Cancer biology and I deal with a lot of Next gen. sequencing data. We collaborate with a group of Bioinformaticians but, it often takes ages to get the data analyzed. Another problem is that most of them are programmers or biostatisticians who do not understand the biology. So, I was looking for a course which will help me learn Python (the programming language used for Bio-data analysis) where being a biologist will give me an advantage and also save time.
This course was just perfect.

2020-12-30,Syed K,5,0,"I enrolled in this course and
completed the course. It is especially useful course for 21st century learners.
The course contents, format and lecture delivery style are practical, concise,
and clear. Anyone with basic English language, basic math (4 operators only = /,
*, +, -) and basic computer skills can learn, enjoy, and successfully complete
this course. By the way, Python itself is amazingly easy to learn/code
programming language and at the same time it is powerful programming language. The
course participants use to ask highly informative & useful questions on the
forum and Dr. Charles’s teaching assistant Mr. Mihaela Mack use to provide timely
supports and guidance. Dr. Charles, his teams & Coursera teams have made
learning Python programming skills very modular and easy to understand,
learn & code. Thanks a lot, everybody.

2020-07-04,Hao L,5,0,"y4e is a great introductory level course and you will learn Python programming from scratch. This course not only opened the gate of Python programming for me but also enhanced my understanding of programming in general. I love the virtual face-to-face way that Coursera presents the course. The classroom-style learning environment they created, even if it is virtual, helps you concentrate better on the lecture and materials and be more efficient along the way of your learning. I really enjoy the way Dr. Chuck conveys the course content to the audiences. Dr. Chuck truly knows how to teach - he utilizes some unique teaching techniques and skills to make everything in the course content impressively easy to understand. This is a great course for beginners. I would recommend it to all my friends who are eager to learn Python.  "
2018-07-18,Abhishek,5,0,"I really liked this course by prof. Charles Severence. He is really good at teaching. He uses humour to teach ya which is a good thing because u can study for hours without getting bored. The course needs a little introduction to any other programming language like C++ or C  to learn this because what u gonna learn is new language which not many people know, it is new and quite complex than other languages(I mean programming languages XD). So, u need a base in which u r good enough to relate python to and understand the difference and complexity of python. In all, this is a very good course which u can take to become a pro in python. ADVICE:: Take python for everybody course only if u r a newbie to programming but in any case, if think that u know basics of any other programming language take the specialization one. TNX
"
2017-12-10,Christian S B,5,0,"I have been self teaching myself programming for many years. But I have never really specialized in anything. It's always been a little knowledge here and there for various languages. The problem was that after time I would forget some important syntax for each of those languages. So I decided that I wanted to, for lack of a better word, ""master"" a language, and I decided on Python.



This course did very well at going over the basics, I thought I would blow through this first course and learn nothing since I have been programming for years, but it was wrong. Although I did blow through the course in a couple of days. The instructor 

Charles Severance's way of explaining things has made me view the code differently, and has helped me write more efficiently as a result. I can't wait to get into the more advanced classes."
2019-12-24,Steve T,5,0,"Excellent introduction to Python for me--someone with limited prior coding experience, but strong Excel and math backgrounds.  I enjoyed the core and optional lectures and found them to provide excellent instruction on using Python.  I would have liked more assignments which would help to reinforce the instruction and get the syntax locked in.  I will probably try to find separate sources for getting the additional practice I need to achieve these objectives.  
As a side note, one-third of my total course time was spent trying to figure out how to get atom to recognize Python.  Evidently, it is a path issue which can be solved with defining a path with some code I don't understand or by checking a path box when you load Python.  I figured out the latter and reloaded Python, but it was a lot of time spent on this issue."
2017-02-04,Ayu P,5,0,"Hello Professor!
Just wanted you to know that this course have helped me gain more confident as I am drop-out student who still struggles to compete with peers who has higher degree. Although I am blessed to obtain trust from the management to head a team in a multinational company, my insecurity sometimes does comes out and I still always feel people doubt my knowledge. 
I have been wanting to learn to code for a very long time, but I always too scared to get started as a lot of programmers seems super smart and I thought I will never be like them.  The way you introduce the course and all materials are entertaining & easy to digest/understand. Your lesson destroyed my belief that programming is scary. 
I will continue this lesson as a challenge for myself and to prove myself that I can also program. Thank you again!"
2022-07-04,FELIPE  P G,5,0,"Aprendí mucho, aunque sé que me falta mucha practica. Los conceptos fueron claros. Sé que hay que inconrporar otras disciplinas y seguir trabajando durante mucho más tiempo hasta que los conocimientos hagan parte de mi ser mismo. El profesor fué muy claro en sus conceptos. Es bueno saber que además, hay ayudas como manuales que complementan y aclaran los conceptos. Se necesita mucha constancia y dedicación en tiempo para completarlo. Y aún más importante, gusto por la programación, Aunque aveces dudaba de continuar, pero simplemente, me sentaba y comenzaba cada tema sin pensarlo. Muchas gracias y felicitaciones a la Universidad de Michigan, a Coursera, a CLARO, la empresa para la que trabajo y me dió también esta oportunidad y a todas las personas que hicieron posible que pudiera realizar este curso y disfrutarlo.

2016-12-27,Ashwin P,5,0,"Great course to learn the basics of Python. Even though I had studied C and C++ earlier this was my first computer course as such. It gives you a good flavor of the way one should learn programming. Dr. Chuck's lectures are exceptionally interesting. I would however like to suggest that some non-graded worksheets could be provided in the duration of the course so that discussions may also take place in the forum. But the textbook provided has sufficient exercises and practice questions but arent discussed in the forums. Overall a very informative and interesting course and will definitely teach you enough to carry forward the knowledge to grasp higher and more complex concepts of programming especially with the help of the textbook that is provided with the course. 

Thank you so much Professor. Im deeply grateful. "
2020-12-29,Christine B,5,0,"This course was overall a great experience for me. I started with no programming experience and a very basic understanding of what Python was. Professor Severance is a wonderful instructor and his teaching style is one of the reasons I will continue on to the next course. The teaching staff that assists in the forums are responsive and helpful and I often found the assistance I needed for assignments just by going through different threads. The program is also very flexible with pace so if you're unsure or intimidated by the material, I encourage you to try it anyways. This course helped me to slow down and search for different solutions which will make me more detail-oriented, and more importantly, not feel discouraged/give up if I hit an error or cannot produce useful code on the first, second, or third go."
2020-07-10,Jorge A B B,5,0,"I have programming background due to my BS in Digital Systems/Robotics, and this it is the most comprehensive introduction I've had to a programming language. Most of my courses, and teachers thought we had previous knowledge, even if it was an introductory course. That's why I recognize this course as the most basic way to enter a programming language, and anyone can grasp the concepts in this first course. 
On the other hand, persons with previous knowledge like me, but with no knowledge of python is a good way to remember the simple things when you started. Also it helps you to slowly get to know the syntax, and you may finish the activities in record time due to you logical thinking of previous knowledge. Finally, gives you an idea on how to help introduce people with no previous knowledge to programming."

Hello, I am glad that I am getting this course from one of the (Best) Author of Python Book. I am really happy with the contents & teaching style that made me so confident about coding in Python. Contents are helpful, discussion forum clarifies  many doubts & the deep understanding of each module in this course make it a perfect choice for anyone to who even does not know 'A' of Python's Alphabet or of any coding language can start & learn to code. Good initiative by Author & Mentor. Please provide many such courses in near future so that we can learn best from Top University which is anyway not possible for students like us with financial problems! We learn many things from home & from Greatest University like in this case University of Michigan! Thanks for all work for making this course available online."
2020-07-18,Muhamed S O,5,0,"It is a wonderful experience to have these kinds of lectures.  Dr. Charles way of presentation of the content draws attention of all types of students according to me. It gives the student the idea of how a programming languages is taught in addition to learning the programming itself. As a teacher in the university level I am very thankful to Dr.  Charles Severance, Coursera and University of Michigan for giving such an opportunity to learn how to teach Python rather than learning it.
The quizzes and assignments during the course are little bit challenging. Short videos make sure students attention. Students get opportunities for creating their own codes during assignments. I appreciate Dr Charles and his team for these. 
I enjoyed it through out.
And one more thing, the 'try/except' is new to me. Thank you."

Let me be clear, this course is not difficult, Dr. Chuck has a good way to teach this course, I am doing other in parallel that I have found I little boring but still interested as well, I have a tight schedule and that is why I need from time to time a motive (find usefulness of or practice what I have learned) to keep me moving forward with this courses. give it a try!

2017-11-30,Roger B,5,0,"I just wrote something about the course allowing the student to access a few various coding exercises (that act, look and feel like the real practice graded exercise) that could appear before each of the chapter graded test exercises. I know that it would require more content, but it would loosen the student up just to have some super simple practice exercises for each chapter that aren't graded so the student could  just to get used to typing variances of code (mostly all the nuances of syntax) and allow them to repeat the same code layout in a non-judgmental way just to see if other variances of similar code could produce a very similar outcome. I don't know if this makes sense... I guess in a nut shell, just letting the student goof off more and try coding the chapter exercises in different ways??? :)"
2018-07-13,Shawn T R,5,0,"Full disclosure, I blew through this in a couple of hours so this is not the perspective of a true beginner. However, that being said I think it's a great introductory course for someone who is a beginning programmer. The instructor puts programming terms and ideas in very relatable and visual language, which is extremely helpful. It's very easy to get abstract and esoteric with programming concepts, so the fact that he keeps it grounded is great. I'll also say that the instructor has a laid back and friendly style that makes the subject seem less intimidating. He's funny and occasionally goofy and I think technical subjects need that kind of approach when they're geared towards beginners. I'm going to continue this course series to shore up my fundamentals and I'm very excited to see how it evolves."
2020-06-18,Benson L,5,0,"    The professor provides detailed and clear
instruction of the basics of Python and clarifies our notion of some concepts
where most beginners might make a mistake based on his ample teaching
experience. It lowers the entry barrier for students like me who studies in
business school.
    Although I have been taken a Python course at school,  some vague understanding then has been
fortified through this online course. For instance, how to define a function
with parameters, the meaning of parameters and the relationship between
arguments and parameters, were the concepts that confused me in function
building. Furthermore, loop control was another difficulty for me to get
through. All the topics mentioned above is clarified now, so if you get some
related problems, this course will bring you a lot."
2020-07-15,Tatiana A,5,0,"El curso es buenísimo para principiantes, te permite entender y trabajar en tus habilidades, el profesor explica muy bien y cuenta con material de estudio traducido en distintos idiomas, el único problema es que los vídeos no están traducidos al español. Si eres hispanohablante y no sabes inglés no podrás realizar el curso cómodamente porque no todos los vídeo cuentan con subtítulos en español.
The course is great for beginners, it allows you to understand and work on your skills, the teacher explains very well and has study material translated into different languages, the only problem is that the videos are not translated into Spanish.

I also appreciate teaching methods of my guide, Charles Severance. He truly put all the herculean efforts  in creating 'Python for Everybody'. Thank you so much all of you. You all helped me a lot to build my career in a proper way. I just want to request you that it will be very kind of you if you can allow us to access this material whenever we want, even after the completion of the whole course as it will help us to revise all the matter just before the placement session beginning. This is my only request to you."
2020-06-12,Kippin W,5,0,"I'm a complete beginner (my IT experience limited to Word and web browsing) and was apprehensive about learning any code. But thanks to Severance's clear explanations I feel like I've learned so much, I've a long way to go but and I'm really hungry to learn more and want to keep going.  I completed the course in 3 weeks (about 30 hours) but I think I'd better go back and try some assignments again to really get my head round them. The forums could be better organised and utilized but I couldn't have completed the course without them. 
I recommend everyone to follow Severance's advise and use a text editor like Atom and run your assignments in Command Prompt (this is clearly explained at the start and in worked assignments). It seemed a bit of hassle at the start but was well worth it. "
2018-03-08,Gaurav B,5,0,  I have completed the course and I found it great. I do think it is a bit slow if you have programming experience in other languages. The instructor Charles Severance explains the important concepts with emphasis and that helps build in ones brain a highlight of things to do or not do. Also the bonus videos are great to either get a backstory on python or the tech world in general. Overall this is a great course.Just for fun: If anyone from the construction of this class is reviewing this comment - I do think the macarena example has not 3 but 4 mistakes. 3 syntactical mistake but 1 mistake is in the steps itself where the left hand is on the right shoulder then the right hand is on the left shoulder. The next step where the left hand goes to the back of the head cannot be performed.  
2015-12-20,J A M,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is da man!  Awesome class.  Dr. Chuck touched upon all the nuances of basic Python that most students are too embarrassed to ask about but which are nevertheless mission-critical to effective programming.  This capacity to address unspoken concerns both in presentations and assignments is one of the secrets of a good MOOC professor since students can't ask questions.
This class is especially useful for those students who just completed codecademy.com's Python class since it explicitly addresses several issues that weren't addressed there.  Finally, no one can rival Dr. Chuck's ability to access celebrity programmers whose presence adds an important dimension of context and helps students feel like they already belong to the international community of coders.  Job well done."
2021-01-03,PAVANA H A,5,0,"  It is fundamental to software development to be able to step through your code, line by line, set breakpoints, and easily examine variables and values as they change. And I believe this would make it MUCH more clear to new software students exactly what a CPU is doing when processing code.I know the video course tried very hard to “sketch” out what is really going on in While loops, For loops, If-then-else statements, and function calls. However, I think that students, especially students new to software overall, would benefit greatly if they could use a more professional tool than the Atom and IDLE tools. And if that’s not possible, I think the videos should show the actual animation of stepping through line-by-line and setting breakpoints in example software, using such a tool."
2020-06-09,Ozan Y,5,0,"In my opinion Dr. Chuck one of the best teacher in the world for Python. Course was amazing and it is very easy to understand for everybody even if you don't have any programming background. I couldn't realize that how quick this course finish and it gives me really good starting knowledge for Python. Content of course was also great and examples are giving sufficient information every week. Quizzes are measuring in a good way to your knowledge and if you have any mistake you quickly realize that what was the wrong.  Conclusion, thank you very much Dr. Chuck you have helped me a lot! For sure I will use this Python programming language for my new carreer and I will improve myself all my entire life. I am appreciate for this opportunity and waiting for you office hours in Turkey!"
2021-11-26,Hong H D N,5,0,"It's good to join the course with zero programming background, yet I would suggest you join at least one course about the fundamentals of programming to understand the concepts illustrated more quickly. Chuck is a great guy considering he's a Slytherin, and his additional materials are interesting, yet I think it shouldn't be counted as a must to pass the course. The given assignments are ok, yet I would love to have 20 instead of 10 questions for the multiple-choice so that I could further understand more of what I'm good at or what I'm still missing. Furthermore, the coding assignments are great; it would be better if we have videos or materials that explicitly explain some of the harder assignments (such as 5.2). Overall, this is a great course and I strongly recommend this.

2016-08-31,Omar S B,5,0,"Whatever level you are at programming, you will learn something new with this course because of the amazing teaching style provided by Dr. Chuck. Takes a seemingly complex subject and makes it incredibly simple and comprehensible to everyone! LOVE LOVE LOVE this course and any course taught by Dr. Chuck.  This is part of an entire specialization.  The only thing that is really lacking is an in-depth discussion of OOP.  He briefly touches on it so that you know to go and look at it on your own time, but I wish he touched on it a little more. Nonetheless, 5/5 on this course. Thanks Dr. Chuck and supporting staff that make this course worth taking. The forum is still ACTIVE and if you run into problems a TA will be there to help you out! Critically to anyone's style of learning."

I'm used to other programming languages such as C and C+, I have been 
told that Python is one of the easiest, most understandable programming 
languages and I can confirm that is true.  At first I was a bit slow in 
this class, but as time goes, the teacher makes it easier to follow and 
makes it interesting.  The videos are not long, so I definitely found 
myself throughout the lectures. Although I was expecting more practices,
 I think with the basic I acquired, I can move on by myself. The topics 
are quite enough for beginners!!! Another thing I like about the class 
id how the teacher bring us to the programming world with his interviews
 with Guido Van Rossum, the creator of Python himself and with Massimo 
Banzi, co-founder of Arduino project. I really ENJOYED!!!

2021-11-30,Farha A R,5,0,"P​rior to this course I felt quite intimidated by Python and the whole idea of progrmming. However, Dr. Sevenrance has totally changed that for me. After having completed this course, I now feel more confident to unbdertake further courses on Python. For me, along side all the rudimentary topics of Python, the biggest takeaway has got to be learing to interpret the 'error' messages, and work through that, instead of getting frustrated and alarmed by it. Dr. Severance deserves a massive shout out for that, because through out the course, he introduced many practical setting where one may get error message and how to detect the issue from there. In fact, he did such a brilliant job of simplifying all the terms and explaining it in layman's language that anyone can get it. "
2022-06-03,Saul T,5,0,"This course was not what I expected it to be. It was better than I could have imagined! Starting out with absolutely no coding experience was a bit daunting, but I stuck with it and I'm glad that I did. Dr. Severence explains each topic clearly and makes things interesting. He seems to be a wholesome, really cool guy and I look forward to the next step which is Data Structures. The best part of these courses is that you can go back and review material if you get stumped on an assignment (Week 6 for me). The hardest part for me is finding time during the day to go over the course material since I'm working 12 hour days in remote locations. Even so, you can download lectures for later which is what I've been doing to make up for the poor cell service I get while at work. "
2020-03-11,陈诗哲,5,0,"Thank you for Dr. Charles! it's the first time in my life to really finish an online course delivered in English and it's extraordinary that the way it delivers can be so simple and systematical. Homework can really inspire me to review what I've been learning. By the way, English skills get improved.

I really appreciate many comforting word set at the very beginning. When you see ""Syntax error"", it doesn't mean you are not suitable for programming language or you are a bad guy. It simply means Python can't understand your language. on the way to learn, finding something wrong is just because Python is not smart enough, you have to find more accurate words to communicate better. That must be great help for a beginner like me. Many Thanks!  Fresh Pythonista, Shizhe Chen."
2017-05-08,Carlos E P V,5,0,"
The course has very nice tools to help you check your code. Although I had a bad time installing python at first, eventually I could made it run both on windows 10 and mac os Sierra. I highly appreciate Dr. Chuck´s humor, not only is highly unusual to joke so much in a class, but needed for something as black&white as a programming class can be. I do have one HUGE advice for the course,  do the little problems in the video. Each video has several structures and ways of doing things, do them each, and squeeze them. You will need it to fully understand more complex problems. I wish the course would do a lot more short reviews, instead of a general review after each video. Continuing evaluation is critical to get more feedback and improve significantly. Best of Luck !"
2022-05-09,Dennis P,5,0,"I loved it. Dr. Chuck has this process down perfectly. He needs to get a stylus, instead of trying to write with that mouse. This is my first sucessful online course. The University of Michigan has done an exceptional job on the web interface. Since enrolling in this course, I have obtained a pretty good list of other resources. I receive daily emails on code snippets, I'm completing my second course in DataCamp and I'm burning through a number of popular textbooks on the subject matter. With the wealth of resources I have found out there, Dr. Chuck must have a more extensive list of resources  that he finds valuable, even indispensible. The resources page needs a ""Dr. Chuck's python programming picks"" page. Thanks again, send more code, see you in the next class."
2015-09-25,Limin ( L,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is the most encouraging and entertaining teacher I have ever met!!! He really makes learning about computer and programming easy and fun! And he makes a great Prof. Snape impersonation! :-)
Most importantly, Dr. Chuck intentionally included many mistakes in his teaching materials. As a self-taught programmer who has struggled on one's own, I believe this is the most valuable part of the lectures. The students get to understand from the very beginning how to read error messages and tracebacks, how to debug, how not to be intimidated by mistakes and failures, and how to become a confident programmer. This should be THE teaching model for programming in any language!
Thank you, Dr. Chuck! And I look forward to learning more from you in our follow-up courses!

2020-08-03,Mel B G,5,0,"This was my very first experience programming. I come from a social sciences & journalism background and although I've always wanted to learn a bit of coding, the idea of it always kinda scared me. But Charles Severance is an amazing teacher and the first chapters are quite intuitive. I wished that maybe teaching assistants were a bit more present, because it can be extremely discouraging to get stuck in some exercises and not receive timely support. When this happened to me I almost quit - but thankfully the learning community is quite active and other colleagues were able to support me as well. My advice is to go for it and and reach out for help if you need it!  I recommend it to all programming enthusiasts, who wished they knew anything at all about python."
2019-06-28,Ramesh M,5,0,"
This is an excellent beginner's course. The teacher Charles Severance is amazing. This was
 my first MOOC and I am glad it was this one. I had self-taught myself a
 bit of programming earlier so none of the material came as a complete 
surprise, but I am sure even beginners can follow everything very 
easily. I plan to complete the entire specialisation based on my 
experience with this course.

The only gripe I have is that because I was auditing the course I could 
not see all the assignments. I can understand not getting graded or 
provided a certificate if I am not paying for it, but at least I 
should be able to see the assignments and solve it on my own. Right now I can only see the quizzes but not the programming 
assignments.

Highly recommended course!

2018-08-18,TEO,5,0,"Wonderful coursera course by Prof Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr Chuck). He speaks clearly, explains well, draws well, and is very witty too ! ( Wearing a soft-felt floppy hat to emphasis quirky Python syntax). Altogether Dr Chuck is a very engaging and instructor who makes learning fun. His assignments are also well-designed, especially those in the Auto-Grader (full of trick questions which I had to keep trying before I hit on the right answers when I saw through the ""tricks"" which made me chuckle) I am very happy that Dr Chuck is my instructor for my first coursera course which rekindles my joy in learning.  I will continue learning programme online, because my first online programming course is very well-taught by Dr Chuck.  Thank you very much, Dr Chuck !"
2020-04-11,Ondrej P,5,0,"Great for beginners. I had no experience with programming at all before I started this course. The lector is amazing. Make it understandable even for non-native speakers.
The graded assignment are sometimes big challenge. I spent sometimes 2 hours to get them done (I made stupid mistakes in the code). The Teacher would have it done in 5 minutes for sure. What I like is they push you to thing by yourself and solve all the problems by yourself ( you can use of course the video lecture ). I hate it on the beginning, that there is no tutorial (step by step) for every assignment. But in the end I'm really grateful for this and kind of proud on me. It gave me motivation and enthusiasm to next classes.
Thank you University of Michigan and Coursera for this Course."
2020-04-12,LiuShu,5,0,"I am totally fulfilled by learning the course of Python, programming for everybody. It brings me a brand new world and aids me to concentrate myself on the basic programming knowledge. The programming skills that I learned from this course ,  the relevant reading materials and bonus videos are quite intriguing and these are an efficient way to link individuals with the outside world. Moreover, the study atmospheres and the teaching settings are pretty scientific and rigid which can help to promote my efficiency on getting started with Python. I would like to express my gratitude for Doctor Charles, for his dedication, we the students of Coursera can get in touch with the first-hand or the latest information on Python. Much appreciated, thanks a lot. : )"

2021-07-07,Wahid T,5,0,"The goal of the course is to introduce students to Python Version 3.x programming using hands on instruction. It will show how to install Python and use the Spyder IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing and debugging programs. The approach will be to present an example followed by a small exercise where the learner tries something similar to solidify a concept. At the end of each module there will be an exercise where the student is required to write simple programs and submit them for grading. It is intended for students with little or no programming background, although students with such a background should be able to move forward at their preferred pace. The course is four modules long and is designed to be completed in four weeks.

2016-01-03,Abraham E,5,0,"Finally made programming ""click"" for me after trying several courses. I feel very, very enthusiastic about this course. I would recommend this to anyone who is computer literate enough to be studying online in the first place. Dr. Charles Severance is an expert in the subject (as far as my newbie self can tell) and he is clearly, beyond the shadow of a doubt, an expert in the delivery of this sort of complex material in a way that beginners can understand. He is also charismatic enough to be pleasant to watch, which matters since most of the course are videos of him talking. 
Besides being easy to understand, the material becomes useful and real-world applicable marvelously quickly. This is really a phenomenal course. I highly, highly recommend it. "
2020-03-04,Azamat D,5,0,"I liked the course.
I did it very fast as I do have a programming background.
I liked the lecturer and the way of how the lectures material was provided. However, the course could have been improved if some extra materials like code listings or some stuff like ""python reserved words"" chart were saved and available along with the video materials.
You can find all of these in internet or while reviewing the video materials for sure, however once you have to recall smth from the course very fast - you have to either go through video or go through google. It is not a problem, it is just some kind of UX flaws as of me.

In general, I liked the course and I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to feel the taste of programming in Python. Thanks!"
2021-06-06,Debabrat D,5,0,"T​he course is really perfect for a beginner as it discusses about the most rudimentary elements. Charles Severance is a wonderful mentor who makes it easy for a noob(who has barely any idea of computer science) when he touches on basics of computer architecture, breaking each line and element of code and what is does in background to the CPU,memory and stuff. I did enjoy all the bonus videos on chatting with many computer pioneers and above all, I would like to say that this is the best basic course on python ever as no one has ever explained it before so minutely word by word. If you are wondering about what is python, then please go through this course for a fun ride, literally. It never goes boring. Also do checkout the pdf and exercises."

People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web services, 
to solve business problems, to work with sensors, drivers and robots. 
Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research 
and applied work. 



Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more 
in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. 


Py4inf and Python explained by C. Servance, is a great developing
 of the foundations in programming (first two courses) that will serve 
you well for the rest of your life, as well as a course that will give 
you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do 
for you.

I strongly recommend this course for anybody, who wants to start with informatics."
2020-05-01,Vandana A,5,0,"The course ""Python for Everybody"" is a wonderful
course and provides sufficient knowledge about the  Python Language. It helps the learner to know
the basics of Python including Variable, data-types, expressions, operators,
loops, conditional statements, functions etc. Also the explanation given by the
professor Chuck is very easy and understandable. He used very good examples to
get you into the flow with the programming. The quiz and the assignments are also
very helpful to check our understanding and revise the things learnt so far
during the course work. And the best thing about the course is that a person
with no prior experience in programming can understand the whole course very
comfortably. Really enjoyed learning this course."
2017-03-18,Osvaldo R,5,0,"I really enjoyed this course. The material was well organised and the video lectures interesting and engaging. The course is an introduction to Python and as such it is suitable for beginners, even those with limited previous programming experience such as myself. Dr Severance is very good at explaining the contents and illustrating the theory with simple and clear examples. Something that I liked as well is the free eBook made available by Dr. Severance that covers pretty much the contents of the entire specialization. I also enjoyed additional videos made available containing interviews with famous IT professionals such as Pooja Sankar, Massimo Banzi (the inventor of Arduino) and especially Guido van Rossum, the inventor of Python. "
2020-11-13,Muneeb F,5,0,"When you set a new goal for yourself, something new to learn. I believe the most important thing is to understand the basics as good as you can. I would like to create an analogy here, You need your hands to do different kinds of tasks, like eating, driving, playing a game etc. So the stronger your hands are, the better you would be able to perform different kinds of tasks. This course is like working on your hands and making them stronger, so that later on you are able to perform different tasks, depending on which direction your interest leads you.
So its an absolute green light from my side.
P.S ( Dr. Chuck the background music that you use in the start of Bonus videos is extremely annoying, you have a very bad taste in Music :-D)"

I am looking forward to the next part of Programming for Everybody (with Data Structures in Python). The thing I appreciate most about this course is that it is completely open to all, from the quizzes and grading to all the course material.

It moves so eloquently that anyone can learn Python through this course, even me. It does not jump to long confusing lines of code or randomly introduce functions/features not discussed. Rather, it sticks to small lines of code to get the point across until you are comfortable with it. the tools achieved in this course are valuable for anyone in any field needed to analyze and/or manipulate data.  I have recommended this course to friends and family attempting to learn. Thank you so much Dr. Severance!

The professor is very engaging and quite easy to follow, he has an amazing way of explaining things and making everything look so interesting. The online book that accompanies the course is also very well-written, and is a welcome addition to the already informative video lectures.
The only drawback I might add is that the course is very simple for experienced programmers that want to get an introduction to Python. I believe though that the next courses in the specialization will cover more advanced topics, and that sacrifice had to be made since it is after all an introductory course aimed at people with zero programming experience."
2015-12-22,Deleted A,5,0,"it was a great course. Mr. Chuck, knows how to teach quality material to the masses. i would only suggest that on the programming assignments, it would be best if the instructor doesn't write half of the code. one reason is that having some of the code written would make that student think that the piece of code provided must be a part of the whole code. and as i worked on the programming assignments i realized that much of the code provided wasn't needed, in fact it took me longer than necessary to solve the assignments because i kept using the code provided, and upon solving the assignment none of the code that was provided was a part of the code i wrote. ....
on to the next course. Data Structure.

The material provided is clear and well-organized, and the teacher is very good. Moreover, the step-by-step assignments are very useful as they make you open your mind in a gradual and confident way. When I was at university, where I attended some preliminary courses about other programming languages, it often happened that the level required in the exercises was instead too high with respect to the material provided during the lectures. Summing up, I really appreciated this first course, although I would suggest to add some other assignment to practice a little bit more."

It keeps me focus on the right things so that I did not get freaked out at the beginning when the working environment looks very different from the experience of an end-user. And it step by step build up my understanding in programming elements. I signed up this course with rather strong motivation (my ultimate goal is to run statistical simulation and develop statistic packages for other users), so when I see the course introducing the elements I did not understand at all before, I can see the power behind those programming building blocks.

I loved his teaching style, which included just the right amount of lecture alongside meaningful examples and interactive questions (I answered back to him through my computer screen, although I don't think he heard). The quizzes and assignments were the perfect level of difficulty (not too easy, not too hard); although I did struggle with the assignments in the last two chapters.

got the basics of programming with python language in nearly a week as as this
course has a lot of content as it's easy to go through it especially if you've
already have another programming language like c or c++ or whatever. As the
instructor said, it's only the first baby steps or I quote ""a part of two
main parts"" to get to know who really a programmer is and what he can do
with coding. So, thanks for this great course I hope everyone gets the chance

Charles Russell Severance (Ph.D.) of the prestigious University of Michigan made brought it down as low as it could get in order to build a firm foundation in programming.
I will recommend this course to anyone who needs to dive into programming and contemplating where to start from. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course."

With the modern world expanding and discoveries made every day, its important that people understand some form of computer science or programming. The teacher, Charles Severance, stresses this point as this course is ONLY centered toward future programmers or rather as common people and professions from astronauts to bankers through a variety of puns, jokes, and fun music. Overall, this course is very helpful and impactful, as the instruction is very thorough and simple with LITTLE AMOUNTS OF TIME REQUIRED. By the end of this course, one with completely no background with programming should be sufficient in creating his or her own program."
2021-03-19,Muhammad A,5,0," This course will teach all the basics of Python programming computers. We discuss how to build a program from a series of simple Python instructions. The course does not have preconditions and prevents everything, except the simplest math. Anyone with moderate computer experience in this course should be able to control the materials. This course covers Chapters 1-5 of the Python for Everyone textbook. Once a student finishes his/her course, he/she will be prepared to follow further programs. Python 3 is included in the course.

2022-05-25,Alberto C,5,0,"What I appreciate most from this course was the well-paced explanations, the storytelling involved in delivering the concepts, It just really resonated with me. Especially the take on the perspective that we're trying to explain things to someone that has no understanding at all, from scratch, in order to achieve clarity as to what we're expecting with our arguments. It's quite a humbling experience, some parts  actually feel like teaching someone a language that is new to them.
After some axioms have been understood, you are aware of the possibilities and are motivated to pursue the understanding for elaborating projects and to seek examples of other projects in order to fulfill one's own. 10 out of 10."

2021-01-22,Marcus  A G,5,0,I want to start by thanking Dr. Charles(Chuck)Serverance for a very thorough explanation of this course. Having been the very first time that I've taken a course of this level of difficulty for me were very challenging.  Dr. Chuck talks about understanding as you go along and true to form I did not understand until the very end. I did make it through after months of challenges and trying my hardest to actually understand. I almost gave up on myself at the very end but thanks to coursera I was able to finish strong. I'm so proud to have experienced something totally out of my norm. I've learned so much more than expected! Thanks Dr. Chuck and all of your helpful staff as well as those in countless forums.
2019-02-15,bryan G,5,0,"I started Coursera with a course in AI and Machine learning only to find out that I was in way over my head. realizing I needed some basic programming skills, I headed over to this course knowing that Python is one of the most use languages right now in programming. As a non-programmer/software engineer-type, this has been an amazing course. Dr. Chuck breaks things down for the average person so you can start understanding how things are done but also WHY they are done (which is more important in the beginning IMO). I'm now walking through the entire section (6 courses) with the end goal to make it back to that AI and Machine learning course and understand it far better. Thanks, Coursera! (and Dr Chuck!)"
2020-07-08,Ashmita G,5,0,"My favorite part was the approach taken in this course. You checked a solid issue I had faced as a beginner in programming back in the day, which was the perspective with which one must approach the syntax errors any programming language (in this case Python) throws at you. One must be positive, understand that the language is, as stated in the course, truly 'lost', and we must make the instruction a bit more clearer to retrieve the desired output. Also, the structure is very friendly for anyone from a non CSE background as well. So proud to have taken your course, there is a learning on an academic as well on a personal front. Thank you for sharing how one must approach a subject one intends to teach. "
2017-09-29,Dan H,5,0,"Really an exceptional course.  Instructor did a great job, and by taking good notes I managed to complete every assignment on my own, without help - which is unusual for online courses.  The automated graded system is accurate but brutally exact, so be careful when submitting because something as simple as an extra space in one of the responses is enough to trigger an error (but fortunately usually very easy to fix).  Another perk is that for people coming from a background in R, like myself, the latest version of Python - 3 - is closer to R than previous versions in terms of syntax, so it's a pretty easy transition.  For everybody else this is a great starting point.  Highly recommend this course!"
2018-04-13,Daniil B,5,0,"This course is very useful and astonishing for people who are starting 
or want to start programming on Python. It contains basic information 
and does not require any knowledge about programming. So, classes are 
brilliant for beginners! 

Furthermore, Dr. Chuck is a significant teacher and his lectures are 
able to inspire almost anybody. Additional materials inside the course 
are interesting and give listener an opportunity to think about 
programming in general, about an essential role of programming in modern
 age of technology. 

Exercises are exciting and helpful. 

I am strongly recommending this course for everybody who wants to get started with programming or just get new useful skills.

2022-07-25,Dennis S,5,0,"I have never gave a 5-Star review on anything that I can recall because nothing is perfect, but this course on Python, which was taught by Charles Severance on Coursera, was the best programming course that I have taken by far. The way Charles Severance approach and explains the details about Python, allows anyone to understand Python and coding regardless of the person's background or experience. I look forward to continue my learning in Python and any other course(s) offered by the University of Michigan and Charles Severance. I thank both Mr. Severance and the University of Michigan for contributing and assisting others in learning this awesome programming language.

Thanks,

2017-10-02,Cammillius J,5,0,"First Time A Programming Course is This Interesting! 
Most of my previous tries to learn Python have hit a dead end as at some point, I lost interest. I felt that the previous courses I had taken before were talking to someone behind me. In some cases, the course was too easy. It left no room to think. Some times, the courses were too hard. As in, the instructor teach something very easy and expect you to do something 10x hard. 
This course was of the right pace. Dr. Charles Severance gives you all the tools you need. I felt like riding the ""Python bike"". I fell, yes, but knew what to do to do better next try. Thanks a lot to the course! Will definitely continue with the rest of the modules. . . "
2020-07-09,Sivaditya V,5,0,"It is one of the best online courses,I have ever taken.Our instructor Dr.Charles is a spectacular person with his awesome knowledge and versatility.Sir's teaching style was soo lucid and simple. This course is one of the best basic Python course for beginners without any  basic stuff.

         I highly recommend everyone especially beginners who doesn't have a knowledge of programming and can assure them  that at the end of the course they will be ready to tackle the world of programming languages with a new confidence level. Its really a worthy course.Just give it a try and see the changes in the perspective of programming that one adopts  during the course time,which is really mind blowing."
2020-04-05,VISHNU N,5,0,"It  is a great course for beginners, Dr. Chuck is highly enthusiastic in his approach.  The course starts from the basics, the explanation to install the software and starting with python was explained very well.  The course covers each topic we need to start with Python. The way  professor makes things interesting is really commendable. I highly encourage students to take this course who are just starting to program, this course gives a flavor of all the important topics required to start python. 

The bonus videos were also interesting. I feel that there should be more assignments. Apart from that this course was really helpful for me to start programming and motivated me to study further."
2020-05-06,Siddhi K,5,0,"This course gives a perfect start if one is new to python. The video lectures are perfectly explained by Charles Russell Serverance and the best part of this course was the bonus associated with every chapters in which students get to know more about many great people about whom we used to study, here i got opportunity to listen to them and get many more industrial knowledge through them and the assignments and the assignment tool to execute the code was also a very perfect part of the course and moreover finantial aid is available for this course so that anyone who wants to learn get an opportunity to learn, this is a very great initiative took by Coursera it is the best part of Coursera.

2019-11-23,Arnab M,5,0,"  This course was presented in a very interesting way, some of the basic concepts were discussed in various depth.The instructor is very good at teaching programming. With well structured assignments and quiz this course is perfect for the beginners and intermediate level leaning of Python.The bonus materials like interview with Guido, CEO of Coursera, Pizza, Arduino etc are extremely entertaining and gives an overview of the current state of technology and entrepreneurship.The course contains various examples and tips to perform different tasks using Python - which without a doubt shall be useful in the future.Overall this course is very informative, conceptual, motivating for the learners.  "
2016-09-05,Stefan M,5,0,"Great intro to python for non programmers.
I have experience with programming and Python; was looking for a refresher, so I ended up finding this remedial (not surprising). Ended up breezing through the content in a weekend on 2x speed.
With that said, this class is an excellent introduction to programming and python. Anyone should be able to pick Python up from this class.
However, the only downside to this course in my opinion is that the programming assignments are trivial. In order to start thinking in terms of algorithms, you need to program. If you supplement this class with some programming challenges (which should be easy to find online), this will be a great way to get into Python."
2020-06-19,Edwina H,5,0,"It would have been better instead of watching the lectures first, then doing the exercises or assignments, we can code at the same time the lecturer is speaking. It is hard to concentrate on a talking head, when the subject matter is coding. We also need to know what are the correct answers to the quiz questions that we got wrong so as to be able to learn from it. Other than that, the course is taught in a logical way, pitched at the right level for beginner coders, and in general, enjoyable. Thank you very much to Prof. Severance and the team at the University of Michigan for creating the course. I am still torn between whether I should move on to the next lecture series in the course. "
2019-07-27,Roee F,5,0,"This is an excellent course to learn the very basic of programming. If you have any previous programming background and just want to learn Python syntax and grammer you will be able to go quickly through the lectures and focus on excercising the code.
If you don't have previous experience, you might struggle a little bit to figure out the basics - in that case make sure you don't only watch the lectures but also read the class' book as you progress.
The instructor, Prof. Severence, is absolutely brilliant! The lectures are carefully constructed to take you step by step along the way and his way of teaching really makes you feel comfortable and clears up even the more complicated subjects."
2021-07-10,sai g r,5,0,"

Programming for everybody (Getting started with Python), is a
really good starter for a student interested in coding and wants to master in
Python. This course introduces the basics of Python very well, with detailed
explanation of the concepts, their applications and very well framed reviews
and assignments. Videos and reading materials are put into nice small chunks,
so that one does not feel the learning as heavy load. And the interviews with
famous personalities, that they offer as bonus at the end of chapters, are
really insightful and encourage & motivate students to be committed to their
learning. Strongly encourage beginners in Python to have a look at this course.
Thank you!!

2016-10-17,Sekti W,5,0,"
Amazing course, this course also provided video and text book, so i can learn really really fast. I though it's gonna be hard to learn, but after i red the text book and watch the video. This programming language really fast almost like Javascript, but better and the syntax is syntactic sugar. So during the course, i think the textbook and the video so coherent and clear. So as a student i really appreciated for the lesson about Python. Overall, this course really good. Especially, if you don't have any experiences on programming before, but if you already had it, you should take because it's gonna open up your mind to python and others programming languages.  5 Stars for this course"
2020-04-14,Carter T,5,0,"The flow of information in this course was very easily digestible and left me wanting more with each successive lesson.  The segmentation of lectures and quick turnaround from didactic to hands-on learning facilitated my continued engagement. Regarding the instructor, I really enjoyed Charles's presentation style - he didn't try to impress me with his knowledge and never went too fast through the material, but more than that - he also sprinkled in some bonus topics and code features that someone already familiar with coding and algorithmic logic would be able to pick up on. I am thoroughly looking forward to the next series of courses as I continue to build my foundation in Python. "
2016-06-25,Richard N,5,0,"I tried to learn Python 2 years ago. But I was naive and studied other courses at the same time. During this time I was also working night shifts. I had to quit all courses when I found a new job and they never amounted to anything. I am so happy that I now have found Coursera and this is my first course at Coursera. I have really enjoyed it and it has had a nice level for beginners and smart exercises which make the student really learn the skillsets previously explained in the chapter. 


I would also like to thank you for releasing the book in ibooks format. This was my first time trying out that format and it made the whole experience so much better and easier.


Thanks again!"

2021-02-14,Maame A A,5,0,"  Dr. Charles Severance and his teaching assistants are the best. Before this course I had no idea what coding in general entailed but I was definitely curious. I tried taking some C courses but the lecturers seemed to assume students already had some kind of foundation even though the course said it was for beginners. Dr. Chuck's class was totally different! He really took time to make all the concepts easily understandable even to the layman. Oh and he has such a glowing sense of humor lol. To my fellow beginners, if you've never written a line of code(yes not even ""Hello World"") but are interested in learning this is the best place to start! I promise you won't regret it. :)  "

Learning the concepts and thought-process in programming was difficult for me.  Though I have had a dozen programming teachers, and have read a dozen ""Teach Yourself..."" programming books, Professor Severance flipped that switch in my head to illuminate the root of those concepts and theories with regards to programming.  I am more confident now than I have ever been.  Thank you for this course, and thank you for making it and the materials open so that I may share it with others who are interested in learning to program. "
2015-12-16,Nicole,5,0,"Very good course for anyone  who has struggled to understand how to program, especially in a self-directed/self-motivated way. This course taught by Dr. Chuck was  broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested, and I could follow along easily, with just the right amount of complexity in the quizzes and chapter exercises, so as not to discourage me. 
I've tried to learn computer programming using  Java (inside & outside of a tertiary environment) with very limited success, but switched to learning python because it seemed more intuitive. So while i'm not a complete ""novice"" to programming, this course had the ""Goldilocks Effect"" for me. 
""Just right"" :D "
2018-02-12,Elinor W,5,0,"This class is great! The material, while dense, is explained at length by the professor, and the lectures do a good job of complementing the information in the provided course textbook. In addition to the professor being very down-to-earth and thorough, the mentors are incredibly responsive and helpful when asked for assistance in the forums. My fellow students are also very engaged, and it's a good choice on the part of the course organizers to get us to grade each other's work for the first (optional) assignment. The logic of programming can be very dense and forbidding, but through this course, you will feel like you have a lot of support in learning how to use it."
2021-01-19,Syed M A R,5,0,"A great introductory course! The instructor is so fun; He does a great job to make the student comfortable and relaxed in the beginning. The course is designed excellently to make sure that too much is not loaded on the student too early. The book and slides are very helpful. For the first chapter, I read the book before the lectures and it helped greatly. After the first chapter, I decided to skim quickly through the book and slides of next four chapters and go straight to the quizzes and assignments, and as Dr. Chuck promised in the start: it helped me in understanding the Why of going through all the stages of the programming. All in all, an excellent experience!"
2019-12-15,Amr M E,5,0,"I am an engineer and I studied one programming course for a different language in university and I totally hated it. I thought to give it a try again and I found this course really simple for beginners even with no programming experience. Prof. Charles breaks down everything to make sure the message is properly conveyed and understood. Great teacher! I definitely know more about programming now compared to before the course. I am planning to continue the rest of the Python courses. 
I think it is a good idea though to add an extra section (or recommend external resources) for more exercises after each chapter in the course for students who are eager to practice more."
2019-09-18,Chiazam U,5,0,"Loved this course. I especially like the active transcript feature where you can go back to a specific part of the video by clicking on sentences below the video player window- this is really cool.  I also like the arrangement of buttons around a lecture video - it's very intuitive. The ""Save A Note"" feature works very seamlessly (on PC). You just click the button during the part of the video that you want to save and it adds a snapshot of the video to your list of thumbnails. Lastly, I appreciate the progress bars for each week, and the Overview - these do a good job of showing your overall progress so you know where you stand at any given time. Very well designed. "

This course is carefully designed to be a well organized step by step Python journey, it focuses on the basics, the fundamentals and explains the logic behind each arguments, conditionals, variables, etc. If this is your first time learning how to program and you certainly want to have a clear structure of what is going on with each code you type in and why you are typing it, I will recommend you to try it out.

2019-01-04,Paramasivan D,5,0,"I was a C Programming enthusiast about 12 years ago. Over the years, I had not got a lot of opportunity to code in C (I had been using only ProC rarely, PL/SQL and Unix Shell). This course was very exciting from the beginning. I always wanted to attend classes of professors like Charles. The Idea becomes far fetched when you have a day job to do. I was so excited from the beginning and completing the course and seeing the certificate was icing on the cake. 

Coursera is a big gift for people like me who wanted to pursue higher education, but could not leave their day jobs due to personal commitment.

Giving it 5 stars since the effort that has gone into making these videos is poorly understood by people who have not been in lecturing positions - I salute you ! Having been a self taught programmer from the mid 80's on BASIC with Apple 2E's, it is a breath of fresh air seeing this kind of material on the Internet. I had to dig around in libraries which had books (yes paper!). If the youth could rather spend time exploiting this fountain of knowledge instead of hacking away on FPS and Online gaming then we could see some really cool stuff happen :). "

Very easy for beginners in python who have already some programming background ,Dr. Chuck was so interesting and he has an extra ordinary ideas to capture or grasp things from him without making any doubt on any topics,This course is actually dealing with the basics of Python
I can say that this course will make worthwhile for who have actually going to starts with python

Doctor Charles Severance is an excellent teacher: he explains programming concepts in a friendly way, references on other parts of programming in a way, that you forget why writing code can be sometimes annoying, (when there is syntax errors, or tracebacks, or in the old days with c++ when the program didn´t compile)., has the ability of binding python with computer history, and has interesting optional videos...

2021-04-19,Mohamed H,5,0,Thanks a lot for this enriching course it's been a great learning experience. The course is really made for anyone from any background  just like the name implies. It starts from the very basics of computer technicalities explaining each piece of hardware role in the program execution moving on to installing python and writing code with in a beautiful and seamless flow. The explanation is very simplified yet adequate and very appealing cause of Dr. Chuck's tutoring style and the well presented presentations and content.  I certainly recommend this MOOC for anyone looking to get into programming as there's a lot to know with no needed prerequisites.
2018-03-05,Harsh B,5,0,Wow. the professor is so amazing and makes us immersed into the programming world. I knew much of this course as i knew the basic of C language already. But python was a new language and had many doubts or vague concepts before this course. But Charles cleared all my queries and refreshed every concept. I feel that I am not going to forget all these things for sure as the conceopt got invoked in my brains to last forever. Thank you very much Charles and I highly recommended this course for gteeting a basic knowledge about python. A six out of five course for sure.

Before I enrolled in this course, I had half-year learning experience in Java, that's probably why sometimes I was very confused between these two, like construction of while loop and for loop were a little bit different. I think Prof. Charles is pretty funny, and his demonstration is pretty clear and concise. I am just wondering if he could spend more time and examples to illustrate the similarity between python and other programming languages, and difference like applications, that would be better.

2018-11-22,Dr S K,5,0,"Dr Severance is a gifted teacher. I enjoy all the videos and educational resources very much. I have rarely come across such a charismatic lecturer and mentor and I have over 18 degrees and have studied extensively in many UK and US universitties including Harvard. Dr Severance is indeed the best teacher I have had so far. I am looking forward to the rest of the online classes. Every day after a hard day's work, I enjoy watching the videos and doing the programming tasks. These are excellent classes, very thorough explanations, and to the point. Well done to all the team at the University of Michigan, but especially to Dr Severance."
2019-09-09,Rajatha S,5,0,"I really loved the way this course is organized. All the topics are explained sequentially and none of the basic topic is skipped. Most of the video lectures had programming explanations which helped me to understand better. Although the course covers most important and initial topics, i suggest to have more advanced topics and complex assignments. It is advised to have the code samples and psuedo codes attached in the content so that we can take the reference of it when needed. Overall i would say this course is well suited for beginners in Python and also who are novice in programming. Looking forward to learn more from Coursera. "
2021-02-04,Andres T,5,0,"Charles Severance is an entertaining, self-deprecating, easygoing, yet precise teacher. I was able to get through the tests with 100% accuracy in all of them, due to how effectively he explains the rudimentary concepts of Python throughout his videos. By him laying out the basic principles of it, we as students are allowed to mingle with the tools by ourselves, thus facilitating and solidifying our learning. Exercises are fairly challenging, which certainly motivates you to think of a solution in order to solve the task and give you great satisfaction once accomplished. I look forward to the next course. Thank you, Mr. Severance. "
2020-04-09,Asrar A,5,0,"Prof. Charles Severance, OMG he is just an extraordinary teacher, especially the patience and great sense of humor with which he engages students in learning experience, he delivered the course at a truly understandable way for Everyone on the Earth doing justice to the title of course (Programming for Everybody)... I just loved the course, that is the reason, i could finish it in just 3-4 days spending maximum time due to staying at home in view of COVID 19 lock down at India...
Once again big thank you to Prof Charles Severance and his entire team and all those fascinating videos of his visits to various places he had been to..."
2021-07-27,İlke G,5,0,"It is a detailed beginner course for Python. If you have no idea how computers work and how coding and programming work, then this is the course for you. I had some basic knowledge of programming thanks to my bachelor degree but that was years ago. I forgot most of the thing but concepts stayed. Therefore, it was boring for me from time to time. But it doesn't mean I didn't learn anything new or interesting. I enjoyed Prof. Severance's detailed explanations and interesting anecdotes. There is a new information for everyone unless you're really advance programmer. Thank you to the team who put this lecture together and Coursera."
2022-08-29,Yael C,5,0,"The videos are easy to follow and understand.  The material is straightforward. The educator is likable and very capable.  The assignments are fun exercises and fun playing around with the code.
These make it possible to finish a week or two in less than a couple of hours, for someone who already knows how to program.  For a complete beginner, it will take longer because they'll need to learn and understand the fundamentals of how languages compute and the semantics, but luckily this course explains it all.
I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Phyton, whether they have previous experience with programming or not. "
2020-12-04,Anette B,5,0,"Professor Severance is easy to follow and is very personable. Know that the specialization is divided up into 5 courses. I can say that at the end of the first course, I still feel like I have a long way to go when it comes to dealing with real data. I think the fact that his lectures are transcribed will be very helpful for people who do not speak English as their first language. It was fun to see short video clips at the end of each week to see students who take this course globally as we followed our professor's journey offering office hours. I am definitely inspired to continue on to the next course in this specialization."
2017-06-02,Marek O,5,0,"Before that course I tried to learn python on youtube and on another site that provide learning online platroform, but they leave me with many, many questions unanswered.
This course answered them all. (i.e. What is the difference between ""="" and ""=="", and why is it so important? or Do I have to use ""space"" and ""tab"" on keyboard? or What is the difference between try/except and if/else, isn't it the same?, Why ""elif"", huh? and many, many, many more. )
The best programming introduction I can imagine. Dr Chuck and his lectures are great, especially when explaining differences between human thinking and computer thinking.
Thank You!
"
2020-11-22,Genevieve O,5,0,"Excellent course for a non-tech person. The concepts were clearly presented and easy to understand. There is a clearer understanding in mind mind of the relationship between humans and computers. The presentations were holistic and book was very easy to read and understand. Dr. Chuck´s humor helped to lighted the things up when things started to get intense by chapter four. my only concern is that there needed to be more clarity with regard to combining multiple functions at the same time within a program. I was lost as to how to lay them out and in which order in my attempts to get results. All in all, wonderfully executed."
2020-08-15,Aviral C,5,0,"I am so excited that i have decided to embark on the journey of learning Python! One of the most common questions we receive from our readers is “What’s the best way to learn Python?”
I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.
Why is knowing how to learn so important? The answer is simple: as languages evolve, libraries are created, and tools are upgraded. Knowing how to learn will be essential to keeping up with these changes and becoming a successful programmer."
2019-09-15,Argunova E,5,0,"Это мой первый онлайн курс в жизни, рада что взяла этот курс на Курсере. Спасибо за этот курс. Отличный преподаватель, прекрасное объяснение, интересные задания. В этом курсе вся информация идет в нужной последовательность, поэтому я не разу не запуталась и отлично усвоила материал. Хотя мой английский язык среднего уровня, мне удалось все понять и выполнить) 

This curs is first online curs for me. I'm very glad that I take it. Thanks for curs. Teacher is fine, perfectly reasoning, interesting assignment. All information go in rite sequence, I don't wander. Althougth my english is not very well, I may understend and execute."
2020-11-17,Amarilis S,5,0,"I loved the way this curse is organized, it has a simple language, not complicated but at the same time it makes you grow and self learn. The part I liked the most was when I was in trouble, I had a lot of materials to read and videos to watch. Well, finally at the 5.2 assignment I discovered there is many possibilities to write a code, at some point I thought I would never crack it but with the help of Mihaela Mack (from the help center/ teaching staff),  I could finally understand the little details I missed and my code worked! She is my hero, she answer me in a timely manner and she is also very good explaining Python. "
2020-07-17,Swarupa I,5,0,"  I had done a project using python language before this class , but had not learnt it very well. Through the 'Python for Everybody 'course on Coursers by Professor Chuck ,i have learnt basics of python and really enjoyed coding. Being a Mechanical engineer i was difficult to start coding but the course helped me build interest and work upon the assignments with lots of motivation and willingness .I am very much interested to continue learning through the next course on 'Python data structures'I want to thank Professor Chuck , Coursera team and University of Michigan for making such a wonderful course available.Best Regards
 "
2020-04-03,Vivian L,5,0,"I felt the way Dr. Chuck structured his teaching videos allowed me to keep focus and not get bored.  Dr. Chuck explained the concepts very well! I'm really glad I took this course! I felt doing the assignments really cemented the concepts.   The video interviews with the experts were really interesting to watch and how Python grew over the years.  The quizzes were not hard.  I had taken a C++ course 20 years ago and was not so great at it, now I feel I more confident in programming.  It's all very interesting as I can use what I learned in my work place.  I've told my coworkers to take this course, definitely worth it."
2017-11-10,jiarong s,5,0,"Love the way Professor is teaching. I am a beginner in programming, so basically I know nothing in this field. But the way professor explains things and the way he introduces programming and python just makes me even more interested in programming. Now, after finishing week 1 material, I am so excited to continue learning this stuff. I was very nervous and stressed about learning programming, but professor just makes me much more relaxed and confident to learn. Thank you so much! I am so grateful that I find this course! This is the perfect start for me. I appreciate all the efforts and time you have put in this class. "
2020-05-02,Badal K S,5,0,"This course provides you the knowledge of Python from the very basics which is a great thing as I didn't have any coding background. It was amazing to have a great teacher as Charles Severance who made the pieces of stuff easier to understand and quite enjoyable especially while he was describing his hat. Really it was my pleasure to have this course, now I am able to relate to programming in Python and get to the basics of the different terminologies in Python. Overall, I enjoy and learnt different stuff around in this course and had a great time on this course Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python).
"
2017-09-07,varunendra m,5,0,"It was a very nice course, Dr chuck Engages you in class very well.I am not from CS background I was an Aircraft mechanic but still i will say : This course teaches you not only very basics of Python But you will know many other programming stuffs as well, Say it as good practices of programming .I completed this course from Coursera And l was  planing go to the site py4e.com to get a advanced knowledge of python.But I found other related courses as well so I will stick back to CourseraOnce again Thanks Dr. Chuck,Its hard for me to pay now for the whole Specialization  Yee I will love to get a free certificate ;-)"
2020-09-27,Suryatapa S,5,0,"It was an awesome course. It covered all concepts in python from basics. They provided assignments, quiz,and many more . I had some prior knowledge in Python but this course helped in a quite good revision of the topics before the placement and helped a lot. It provided all information about if ,if else, loops,def ,try except. There were some topics which i could easily gasp well as the teacher explained with some real life scenario and examples of real life people ,completely different from the books. Some bonus videos were also provided, they were fun to watch and refreshed for some time being...Thanks a lot. "
2018-06-22,Adam B,5,0,"Great introductory course. Walks you through installing the software and using it, or you can use their browser based Python Playground if you don't want to deal with that.It's very basic. You won't be able to do much after this course, but you will have a good foundation and want to learn more.Time requirement is reasonable. I completed it in about 20 hours across two weeks, and that included getting Python set up on a PC and a Mac and learning how to Git and Github so I could keep my files updated across both of them.Definitely do use the recommended atom.io text editor. It's great, especially if you use Git."
2018-04-26,Ivan S,5,0,"It's really wonderful course! This course gives a good start in Python. I really recomend you to take it. I enjoyed it, it wasn't boring. Dr. Chuck did a great job and I really thankful for this. I recommend it to people who don't know how to start with programming. The way it was explained it's really easy to understanding. Even if your English not really good (like mine), you can try it. Once you completed this course, you will have an eager to complete a specialization. Anyway you shouldn't stop only on fundamentals of programming but keep going to make something more complex and interesting. Thanks a lot!"
2020-07-28,Aida M B,5,0,"Un curso excelente, fácil de seguir gracias a las explicaciones tan didácticas y cómodas (código de colores, orden...). Te hace ver desde un primer momento que la programación se basa en el razonamiento lógico, por lo que ha roto con el estereotipo que yo tenía de ""ordenadores = aburrido"" y el curso me ha interesado cada semana más. Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo!! Me parece que las explicaciones llevan el ritmo ideal para captar la atención de alumnos novatos en el ámbito.  Personalmente me ha motivado mucho el contenido y la manera de evaluar, y voy a continuar los siguientes cursos de Python for Everybody.  "
2020-06-14,Rochelle M S,5,0,"Very nice lecture and helpful exercises. If you're new to
Python, this is the best course to start with. The basics were properly
discussed and Dr. Charles Severance was able to discussed the topic clearly and
with enthusiasm. Even if you don’t have much background on programming, you can
easily catch up with these lectures. The topics were also divided into several
parts, so you can easily pause for a while and then continue whenever you want.
But all in all, this is one of the best lectures I had. I'm glad I have taken
this course. Will continue to enroll in the next class which is about data
structures."

2018-07-18,Sharon Z,5,0,"I like the way Dr. Severance teaches programming. His teaching is straight forward and very mistake free when you apply what he teaches as he's already talked about the possible mistakes the learners may make. I was a software engineer 15 years ago, and now I would like to learn some new skills and this is the first official time I am back to the programming world. I am very grateful that the first course I started was Dr. Severance's class. Thanks to Coursera as well for putting such quality courses online. I plan to finish the 5-course python specialization and this first course boosts my confidence!"
2019-01-17,Regina C,5,0,"If you are a complete noob, this is the place to start. The course is very informative about the basics of Python that is put in a highly simplified manner. The instructor is entertaining and pleasant to listen to. 
I wish there were more graded projects than what is required. The projects are brain teasers, can be tough until you have the ""aha moment"". Don't expect to ever be given the answer. You must figure it out on your own.
I do not like Coursera's video player, it does not have good controls. There is some clunkiness to the GUI, but overall a good experience. Will continue throughout the courses. "
2018-07-03,Eoghan D,5,0,"Having had little to no experience in coding (only a brief two week module using python in my second year of university) and online courses in general, I am so happy that I decided to sign up for this course. Charles Severance is a fantastic lecturer who does an excellent job of helping students to actually understand and apply the thought processes behind coding rather than simply memorising what others have done. The course is perfect for beginners with a slow pace that gives people time to digest what they have learned. I am now looking forward to taking part in more courses in this specialisation."
2017-12-22,Jose R,5,0,"I took this course to learn the basics of python for my own personal use, and to develop these skills into data and file manipulation for future career use. I had a little HTML (like, very very little) experience and Visual Basic (.net) experience before taking this course. Having prior coding experience before, this course was very easy for my to get through. However, I am confident that even a non-techsavvy, no prior experience student would have no trouble getting through this course do to how well it was structured. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking into getting started with python. "
2020-07-04,Afiqah A,5,0,"A lovely introduction for someone who has little to no
knowledge of programming. I would attribute this to
Dr Chuck's ability of teaching, e.g. language usage.  Additionally, the way the lecture videos were
broken down, had made things easy to understand, as it gave room for students
to digest each segment. Before enrolling myself, I had gone through low rated reviews;
the pattern I saw was that many had complained the course was too “easy”. Those
who already had pre-existing Python knowledge left these reviews. If you are
like me and had never attempted Python before, this is a good place to start."
2022-01-24,Nirmal P M,5,0,"I started this course having some experience with C++. The course is appropriately structured well explained. The assignments and quizzes are designed in such a way to make sure that you understand the lectures. It was to the point and short; there was no unnecessary dragging or confusing classes. The professor clearly explained everything. I will be doing the rest of the course as well. Helpful. Beginners should definitely take up the course; it is going to be really helpful for you guys. The explanation is straightforward, and the entire course is designed keeping beginners in mind. All the best!"

2018-01-08,Meenakshi P,5,0,"Excellent course, well taught. I don't have a computing background.  
Weeks 1-4 felt easy, Week 5 I had to focus, and weeks 6&7 I was pausing a lot and trying to digest the material. 
Next time  this course is run it may be helpful to spread this material across 8 weeks, so that material in weeks 6 and 7 can be done over 3 weeks. instead of 2 weeks.
I would also like to see more exercises (even if not graded) in weeks 5 to 7. E.g. to try out the various new lessons/functions.  Although, on relflection, there was nothing stopping a student trying this out in Atom or in the PY4E playground!
Many thanks.

"
2020-10-08,Muhammadiev S O,5,0,"  I haven't had a lot of other online courses, but this one seems to be a very good introduction to learning a new programming language. It's mostly for beginners who are new to programming in general. That's why I had to speed up the playback, because I've been doing development in other languages for quite a long time by now. And that's convenient, the fact that you can turn on captions for the video you're watching or see subtitles below is very nice. Also, excercises are probably the most important part. I liked the way they were organised.
Thank you Dr Chuck and many thanks to the Coursera Team  "
2019-06-01,Lemboye A,5,0,"Upon taking this course, I had zero knowledge of Python, Programming. I always wanted to learn but it always seemed complex.
Up stepped, Python for Everybody by the charismatic Dr Chuck Severance. It was different. The course is both easy to understand and very detailed. It is also quite compelling, meaning for someone like me with a relatively weak self-discipline, I did not have to conjure up this ""amazing"" will power to complete this course, it automatically drew me in like a magnet.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any one looking to begin his journey in Python and Programming."
2019-01-31,Arslan A,5,0,"Although the course 1 is just a beginner's start to the python programming language, but the way it is created will definitely inspire many students to start python programming language seriously and professionally. The worldwide office hours, meetings with other tech person and new technologies introduction etc all are created in a way that nobody can feel alone while taking this course and Its just the start, the other 4 courses in python specialization are must to enroll for professional start. Thank you Coursera, University of Michigan, HEC and Sir Charles Severance for such a amazing course."
2020-06-01,Akanksha K,5,0,"I am an in undergrad course so my review will be valid for all those beginners in programming out there. So first of all for a beginner this course sounds just parfait.For me it taught me how to think like a programmer. In this you have the assignments, regular quizzes for each chapter in the course which is like a revision or kinda tests of what you learnt you actually get introduced to the basics of Python.


This course also gives you bonus by introducing to the people who gave birth to Python, Piazza and some of the important people in the community of Programming



All in all



Thanks Dr.Chucks

"
2016-02-26,Khanh P T,5,0,"Having struggled with Python for more than a year and tried different learning materials, I am so happy with the newbie-friendly teaching approach presented in this course. The first few lectures are very helpful as they demystify the conceptual challenges surrounding Python, programming  and computers in general--effectively breaking down the psychological barrier common in many students new to programming. I like the textbook and the bonus videos very much, as they offer contextual information about Python and how people are using programming in the real world. I am a big fan of the professor!"
2017-01-24,Qhemist M,5,0,"This was my first course to do with any type of computer programming I took. I had been interested in the past to learn python, learned some basic stuff but nothing like this. I know how a base understanding of what Python can do. The professor, Dr. Chuck was humorous which made the class fun, his lectures were on point and didn't give you too much information.  The only negative, is I found myself getting stuck at assignments and having to look for help elsewhere to complete my programs. I hope with the more I continue to learn, I will be able to finish the assignments with my own knowledge."
2016-01-06,Berkeley B,5,0,"I really enjoyed my time with this online experience.  Though I managed to get thru most of the course without having to post a question, I did realize in the end how easy and responsive the course TA's are in follow up. And there is also the community of other students whom I was able to learn from in seeing their questions and answer sessions.  You have no idea how important it was for me to be able to review the material in snippets in my day and then review it again and again so that I could comprehend the nuances of the lessons. Amazing, I wish I had this when I was in my undergrad days.  "
2021-09-16,Jessie C,5,0,"As a 46 year old without a strong background in math or science BUT I've always had an interest (and self-taught myself some areas such as basic HTML), I found this course very helpful in evaluating if I wanted to try a career change into programming. It is a challenging course but it gave me some perspective about how I learn and the possible time I may need to dedicate in order to make this change happen. I went back and forth between rating this a 4 or a 5 because I think it is a 5 for video content but a 4 perhaps on amount of practice work. I only used the DB once but it was SO helpful. "
2020-03-17,Kumar A,5,0,"The course was awesome, well-furnishing and compatible even for those who are are not aware of programming techniques though. In my opinion, if someone is going to start a journey over python then I'll recommend him/her to kindly pursue this course at least as a start, and I know they will love the respected instructor and his course content and his unique way of imparting knowledge as well.
The only thing I missed here was, they should add a bit more content, adding up some more concepts to the course so as to match-up with the necessities of a well-contented beginner level course on python."
2020-02-20,Fuze,5,0,"Although this is not the first online course that i have ever taken, this must be the most interesting and the most progressive online course for me. I will move on to the subsequent courses. After taking this course, you will absolutely master how to install Python3, how to write .py files and how to run them. Furthermore, you will learn the mechanism of conditional statements, while loops, for loops, functions, etc. It may be a little confusing when you first started this course, but after countinuous learning, you will be interested and immerse yourself in it. This course is worth taking."
2022-09-25,Seyedehforough o,5,0,"If you want to learn Python or just ""a"" programing language to get a start or just dabble in programming, this is a great place to start!This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to, unlike some moocs I have taken where the teachers were reading and got the intonation all wrong--very distracting. This one wasn't like that by far. He was interesting and even funny at times."
2016-12-24,Deleted A,5,0,"
Took the course as a first
step in dealing with big data science.
The structure of the
course is at all times comprehensible and it has a rather smooth
narrative. 

The course book is easy to
understand, though at times it feels like it skips some steps. 

The strongest point of the
course is the instructor himself. Having thorough knowledge of the
subject at hand, teaches in a funny and at the same time really
productive manner. In short he teaches as an educator should teach.
To sum up, really  good
MOOC programme, gets you ahead in a few weeks time. Will definitely
enroll for the second one."
2020-08-23,Maria C F,5,0,"  Highly recommended beginner friendly course with great lecturer! I have not taken many CS courses but compared to CS50X, Dr. Chuck Severance is really determined to not only teach python but to make sure students understand and he delivers content in very entertaining way. He even wrote and published the accompanying literature for free online! You can tell from the offline office hours that he really does care about his online Coursera students.In addition I really love the mini interviews with the startup founders and python developer. It really enrich my knowledge about the IT industry.  "
2016-09-03,Tianran Y,5,0,"Very well done course. It's very slow, so if you're looking for something akin to a full time college course, I would take this at either double or triple the pace the course recommends. It's geared towards people who have never developed or really looked at code at all, so if you have, you'll be ahead of the pack. Overall, I enjoyed the course a lot. It definitely covered things from many angles and went through things slow enough for me me to process everything. That said, I was also able to increase the speed of the videos and complete a few weeks in one when I had the time. Fun class"
2020-06-26,JUAN P G B,5,0,"Was a really nice experience, it is helpful for check and
reinforce base knowledge for python programming. The instructor explanations
about the different subjects was easy to understand and the examples and test
made helps a lot in the practice of python coding. The course feels friendly
and comfortable, that is makes go through the weeks with high expectation and
keeps the interest in a high level. For people with none or just a few
knowledge about programing, is a great course to start and at least in my case,
encourage me to keep learning and improving my programing skills in python "
2021-02-14,Eleni A,5,0,"Thank you very much for the great experience with these courses! I am very pleased with the teacher, since he attempts to get into your shoes and think as an amateur, while he is not! He succeeds because every time I had a question on his lectures, it was going to be answered either some seconds later or in a later chapter! Also I would like to thank Mihaela Mack for the help and precious advices! I never felt insecure or lost while I had the opportunity to find whatever I was looking for inside the material and forums of the course! I definitely recommend this course for any amateurs!"
2020-03-07,Jeel P,5,0,"The best thing about this course is the Instructor and the video quality, its easy pace, its content which goes from the following path ---> very very easy - very easy - little easy -  easy - little intermediate, and it goes on... I mean that the instructor is very much student-friendly, not that kind of instructor that just come to the lecture-gets the beginner and intermediate topics mixed up, starts mugging up what he has to teach and just fades away with a piece of paper without any value in our hands(course certificate). Don't just read reviews get your a** off and start working."
2016-07-10,Scott F,5,0,"This is a great class for someone who has no experience with Python at all. Dr. Chuck does an excellent job helping you understand the core concepts in a manner that is easy to learn. The lectures are interesting, easy to follow, and full of great material. The quizzes are simple enough but you do have to pay attention in order to get them correct. The assignments were a lot of fun and made you think of how best to incorporate everything you learned. This was a better experience than I have had in other courses I have been through. I am definitely taking the next class from Dr. Chuck!

The main attraction of the course is it's arrangement in a sequence step by step form which makes understanding concepts easy.
Each video in the course doesn't tell only how to do program, but also clears the concept of the programs and why we are doing that program.
Really any person can learn python through these course even he has a programming background or not. 
Overall course is so good and helps me in enhancing my programming skills."

2020-06-06,THIAGO T,5,0,"É um curso muito instrutivo. Foi o meu primeiro curso do Coursera e também a minha primeira linguagem de programação. O curso foi muito bom para mim que não sabia nada de programação, desde elementos básicos como instalar e rodar os programas, e evoluiu até a utilização das ferramentas de programação. Esse primeiro curso é bem introdutório, então para pessoas que já conhecem programação, acredito que deve servir mais para reforçar suas ideias, mas para iniciantes é bem instrutivo. As avaliações são bastante didáticas e a resolução dos problemas são desafios possíveis e divertidos."
2016-01-30,Chandrama S,5,0,"I am a research student and working with Matlab Programming currently. Previously I did Masters in Geography and I had a very little experience in programming language as my entire course study was based on theory, statistical applications in geography. 
Dr. Chuck's lectures really helped my out to learn coding from scratch and at the top of it I am now able to find out my loopholes while I do coding on Matlab background. Definitely I will take more courses from Coursera in future and when I have saved much, I will upgrade my course to get my completion certificates.
Cheers

2020-01-13,sreeram s,5,0,"I really enjoyed learning this course. Though I am a beginner in programming, I was able to follow, comprehend and apply the contents taught in the course. The instructor stayed true to his vision in making it easy for everyone to learn programming through this course. Additionally taking it on coursera online platform helped me do it at my own pace, pause, take notes and really grasp the content. The assignments were appropriate and interesting.
I strongly recommend this course to newbies willing to take the plunge into programming. Python seemed lot more easy to learn and apply."
2017-09-27,Charles S,5,0,"Dr. Severance kept everything very clear. I really appreciate that he has mastered the pace required to make sure you don't miss something, even when you think he could go faster. He has also mastered how to explain the translation from human thinking to computer code really well. I have found that other teachers have gone ""native"" with computer thinking and cannot explain it clearly.  Clearly, this course makes you confident to continue on with the rest of the specialization. Note, if you have even a little coding experience, you can do this first course in a week quite easily."
2021-10-08,Mojtaba A,5,0,"I​ loved the course. Dr. Chuck is as always charming you through the course. Despite I know more than most of the course contents, I got a lot, specially about the way I can apply a functional multi-platform really simple programming text editor called Atom. Dr. Chuck (as the brilliant Instructor of the course), Coursera (for the generosity of its financial aid), and the university of Michigan (for its contribution and cooperation), Thank you so much all. I wish you all the best. You are all making my life better and better together.
Again Thanks a million dear fiends of mine @-  "
2020-05-09,Mohd A N,5,0,"I'm not new to programming, I'm not new to Python, but I took this course just to see the way Mr. Severace teaches. I loved him! I completed the whole course in literally less than 6 hours of binging and completing the assignments plus the bonus material. A 100% of it. It was almost a quick refresher for me.

If this is your first time into programming, this is the best place to start with. Mr. Charles Russell Severance is the fun way to start with. The content is to the point and deals straight to the point with added fun. No nasty tricks/shortcuts, just plain beginner content. "
2016-04-17,Quanxiong Z,5,0,"I've tried the Python course of Rice university, and some part of the Codecademy Python course! This is much more basic and offer a fundamental view about all programming language not only just python. Compared to the Rice University course, this one is more for a new beginner who hasn't done any coding before. The Rice course doesn't really need any coding exp, but with the projects get more complicated in the end, it would be much easier if you have somewhat coding exp before, at least in my opinion. 
Anyway, I can't wait for all this specialization of University of Michigan!"
2022-08-04,Yessine G,5,0,"This course was really great and very benefecial. before this course, iknew nothing about python.But now, i understand the basics and the concept of python. This helped me especially at my studies as my marks improved in the final exams after this course. i loved especially the way lessons are given and appreciated the professeur dr.chuck , he is very professional and his methods of teaching just makes lessons easiers and funnier and that's what pushes you to complete the course and then you to take other courses with him.
really this was a wonderful and benefecial experience."
2020-06-14,Unzila N,5,0,"The following course ""Programming for Everybody"" provides basic, useful knowledge of programming languages and terminologies used by a computer programmer. It is indeed very helpful for a non-programmer like me to initiate and learn a new scientific field of study and to further take over the commands within. Moreover, the instructor is excellent and expert in his field. He explains the tricky concepts  so well with contextualisation. He successfully kept me captured throughout the course. And I am keen to opt for the other specialization courses taught by the same Professor."
2018-12-25,Nattawat B,5,0,"Professor did really great job in trying to make every newcomer love programming. Professor have done a really great job explaining all the stuff in only a short period of time.
As a person who have already studied Python before, this course is really helpful and is a quick review for most material studied before. The assignment and quiz is quite easy. 

My recommendation for improving this course is to teach python by using the python instead of powerpoint in slides. It will make everything much clearer and people who haven't learn python before can understand things easier."
2017-02-26,Carlos A,5,0,"IMHO, Excellent introductory course. Well planned, enabling students to interact and take baby steps into this really powerful language. Smart, casual and yet precise lessons will help you to go through the initial necessary steps in the language, building a fundamental base where you will construct your python coding skills!. Loved it. Platform quizzes  and assignments help you make progress and push you to review your notes and the book content, enabling you to feel comfortable with the speed of the lessons. Thanks to Chuck and the Teaching Staff of Python for Everybody!

2016-06-11,Syed A A,5,0,"It is initially difficult to follow any course regularly on any online teaching website. I have tried studying various courses on coursera before but I usually ended up in leaving the course. This is the first course I completed and I am really happy. Professor has really put lot of effort in teaching the course and also tried to make it fun. Thumbs up to Professor Charles Severance! However this course is really meant for someone who was never exposed to programming. As I have had some exposure, I increased the playback speed to 1.5x (So thumbs up to Coursera as well ! )"
2018-02-04,Xavier d,5,0,"Very happy with this course, Charles' passion shows and I appreciated the ""let's not rush things and step back a bit"" approach which makes us think things through and therefore provides a deeper understanding of the concepts covered. 
Charles' tuition is logical, easy, relaxed and actually fun to follow, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone wanting to start having a basic ""coding culture"", also I believe that being capable of instructing a computer to do something with the clearest, shortest and simplest instructions can be useful for any training exercise. "
2022-05-23,adnintya r,5,0,"The course is fun. For someone who has never used python before, it helps alot to know and learn about basic python. The teacher has a lot of experience in programming, especially Python, and delivers the class really well. He doesn't just give us the theory but also shows us the example that makes me as a student get easier to understand. The assignment also helps a lot in improving our skills because it makes us practice writing a script. Thank you very much for this course, I hope it will also help other people out there who want to learn python for the first time.  
"
2020-10-17,Christine D A,5,0,"Mr.Charles not only entertained me throughout the course with his Harry Potter references and mini jokes that he slipped in throughout the material but also managed to keep me going whenever I stumbled by reassuring me that ""when my code breaks, it doesn't mean that I will fail as a programmer"". ""Python just needs a little help!"" :D Thank you for this wonderful, easy to follow, interesting and informative course which was taught in a way that simplified concepts ,so much so, that it became extremely easy to remember! Looking forward to the next part of this course! :) "
2018-01-12,Sha W,5,0,"I have seen and tried quite a few coursera courses and this one was especially engaging and helpful. The lecturer clearly has lots of experience and it's easy to stay focused. I never get bored from his videos. The assignment difficulty might have been a little more consistent. While the first ones barely took me a minute, the final one took me a few weeks and even today I don't understand why the tiny changes I've made have had such different results. I would like to know more about that.
I'm going for all the other courses in this specialization. Really enjoyed this."
2022-02-14,Vinicius A,5,0,"Nunca imaginei que poderia iniciar o aprendizado em programação com macarena!
O curso é bem simples, leve e direto; as analogias do professor Charles nos fazer entender facilmente o que ele quer passar.
Os exercícios são simples no começo, porém, a dificuldade aumenta com o tempo e fica cada vez mais legal a tentativa de criar um programa para resolver um problema, por mais simples que ele pareça de início. Recomendo muitíssimo para quem quiser entender um pouquinho melhor como tudo o que utilizamos hoje em dia, através de celulares, computares, tablets, etc, funciona!

2016-09-21,James M B,5,0,"This is a great opportunity to learn some excellent skills in a language that is powerful yet easy enough to learn the basics.  I enjoyed every moment of this class.  I learned a lot about python and Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck) provides an excellent learning experience why presenting the material in a concise, structured and fun manner.  I'm pursuing all 5 (even the capstone course) courses to earn the specialization in an up and coming language I feel we will see more apps being developed in the Python Language.  Thanks Doctor Chuck and the University of Michigan!"

2021-01-12,Chadi S N,5,0,"  Dr. Charles definitely delivers what he promised by the very title of the course ""Programming for Everybody"". I've taken 2 or 3 programming classes at school but none of them seemed as meaningful as this one. Dr. Charles walks you step by step to understand, think, and make sense of all the information he's stating not to mention the well-thought approach of having assignments and sample programs to figure out their code on your own.If you're into learning programming and you think that it's an alien's language or whatever, trust me this class will change your view.  "
2018-06-12,Аитор Х,5,0,"It's an awesome introductory course specially designed in a way that everybody can easily understand all the classes. I don't have a technological background and I'm pretty confident to say that the course can be easily undertaken in 1 week or two weeks if you have easy with absorbing new content and if you like it, so that you can move on to the next one and do other courses more advanced. Also this is easily a course that can be leveraged to other machine learning related courses in which python is the most common tool. With that said I wish you the best of luck !"
2017-05-19,Deleted A,5,0,"Dear Dr. Chuck! Thank you VERY MUCH for the most outstanding course I've had so far. Your sense of humor and your eagerness to teach are the most valuable things in this course. They transfer studying into a fun and interesting process. 
This course is very good for the beginners with completely no knowledge about what programming is. I think that people who know one or more programming languages may wish to have more changeable tasks and learning. 
Seven weeks for the course may seem too long but nobody restricts you from rushing forward. 
See you in the next course!

2016-10-22,Jaffer G,5,0,"This was an excellent beginner level course for Python.  Though I had prior coding/programming experience with MATLAB, I learnt new and interesting things from the perspective of a computer science course. I also have to say this was the first course that I successfully completed on Coursera which is a reflection of the interesting course material and the enthusiasm shown by Dr. Charles Severance in his videos. I particularly enjoyed the last assignment. I will definitely try to complete the specialization from here. Thank you Coursera, UMichigan and Dr. Severance! "
2021-01-06,Senem Y,5,0,  Since i started this course on coursera my point of view about programming has changed .I was struggeling so bad about understanding and writing all the codes.However with this course it became much more easier than ever.I am so thankful to take it.I thank especially to Charles Severance because with his course programming became fun and enjoyable topic for me.It was not like any class i took on my university.I havent bored even a second.Thank to coursera  and to Michigan University also to give me the chance to reach this course from the other part of the world.  
2016-10-25,Zafrin M,5,0,"Love Dr. Chuck. He makes the class fun and interactive. This a probably the best call to take if you are thinking about learning programming (in any language). Python is very intuitive and easy to learn. it will give you a sense of how to think like a computer.
The best tip I can give someone who is serious about actually learning the material is the following:
1. watch the lectures, take notes
2. read the book, play with interactive python in your computer, look at python documentations, as necessary.
4. Do all the exercises from the book
5. Do the course assignments "
2015-11-08,Paloma A d O,5,0,"I never had a programming class that covers really the base of the basics in such a deep and easy to understand way, not taking for granted many things. Professor Charles Severance has a great sense of humour (it looks like you are talking to him in person, it's not something spectacular for the camera) and very generous showing his team, amplifying knowledge through interviewing many interesting people. Exercises were very helpful to understand the chapters. Would appreciate if could  have more exercises (not for grade, but for practicing). 
Super recommend it!"
2020-05-03,Mahesh G C,5,0,"Excellent course for the
beginners in Python. Well managed and easy to understand with given
examples.  Asking the assignments which
is the best way to understand how much we have learn. I will definitely refer
this course to others also. At the start of this course I do not have any
knowledge about the python. But after completing this course now I know the
basic and some advanced topics of python. Now I am able to write and run the
program in python. Thanks to instructor sir for explaining this course in a
very different and understandable way. Thanks a lot."
2020-02-17,Yaroslav K,5,0,"It's my one of two first online courses. I really liked the way of Dr Chuck's teaching. I taught Swift 4 by myself last year. That's why a lot of things I found familiar to me. But on another hand I've covered some deep programming (logic) details that I didn't know before. 



I think that's such way of learning is much more efficient than studying something just by a book or documentation (of course it's better to combine and use as much additional info as possible).

Would could be done better? You could add built-in questions into videos for more interactions."
2017-12-10,Siddhartha S,5,0,"I had started out this course with great trepidation, of the fear that I may be too old to learn programming. However, I must state that Dr. Charles Severance is an excellent teacher. I have managed to complete the course well ahead of time. I have had very little programming experience and was glad to be able to complete the assignments on time. The course is well structured and I was able to follow the material well enough to complete the quiz at the end of each chapter without any hiccups. Thank you Coursera. I look forward to taking many more courses here."
2016-01-16,Shreyans s,5,0,"i am really in love by the way they teach 
the method for teaching is so perfect by taking quiz ,assinments and all that helps students to know about himself/herself.
and the bonus videos of interviews of great founders and CEO's inspire students to do something more creative for the next time

and most important student's saturated notes.
they helped you out to clear your concepts more precise so my advice to all newcomers is to take a brief look on notes.

and also Dr. Charles Severance and his team deserves a hats-off for his hard-work. 
love this course....thanks"
2020-05-02,PRATYUSH S,5,0,"  The course titled "" Programming for Everybody"" does exactly what it says. The course is a beginner's level course for introduction to the world of programming. This course is based on python, which is a powerful programming language and focuses on application rather than too much of syntaxes. This course is taught by Charles Severance and he has explained the topics required to learn programming in a very clear-cut concise way, right from the basics. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to start programming and has no prior knowledge in this field.  "
2018-09-24,Donald J O,5,0,"This course is a great introduction to programming for someone with zero experience, and it's useful for those who do have experience to really solidify the fundamentals of programming. It's also a great introduction to python for people coming from other languages. The instructor's videos are very good. He is clear, his explanations manage to be both thorough and concise, and he's personable enough to not be boring but without resorting to too much silliness. For those new to programming, I highly recommend taking notes by hand, and read the book chapters! "
2020-05-31,Sumit C,5,0,"  This is an awesome course, for beginners, in Python, Instructor is cool and he keeps you tightly bounded to the course, pace is good, video lectures are very informative and good, after completing this course I am sure that you will able to explore more of python by yourself very easily or learn any other programming language. I thanks coursera for bringing up such beautifully designed course for beginners. I recommend every one even faculty members to go through this course, this will also help them to improve their pedagogical approach towards teaching.  "
2018-08-11,Jhen J H,5,0,"The programing course is quite easy to learn. The teacher 's explanation is clear and sometimes funny! I think it's a great way to learn programing which makes me happy not boring. When watching the videos without boring, I learn a lot of the basic programing a lot. The ways to hand in the assignment is also convenient, just type your Python code on a website, submit ,and done! The score shows up immediately, so I can correct my code immediately, it didn't take much time for me to learning this programing course. Thanks to the course and my teacher a lot!"
2016-06-14,Clark C,5,0,"I really enjoyed this course, the teacher has a very friendly tone and he is great at explaining all the concepts. I appreciate his efforts and everyone else who contributed to this course. And finally I really like the interviews, it is nice to be able to hear interviews with the creator of Python and authors of Python books and their stories, it helps to broaden my knowledge past just knowing the language but also its history. Overall it was a great course and it taught me a lot about Python while keeping it interesting with interviews of great people."
2020-01-02,Jesse M,5,0,This was my first experience with a programming language (Python) offered by the University of Michigan via the Coursera platform. I have learned a lot during this course. The lectures and all the material are well-organized and structured. Charles Russell Severance is an extremely fascinating and interesting mentor! He explains the material clearly and neatly. I am very excited and happy because there are 4 more courses in this specialization. I will definitely participate in them as well. Thank you a lot for providing such a great learning experience.
2017-03-14,Sam O,5,0,"  It provides good resources and information for basic programming and Python.   The lecture is a true college style.  The chapters are well organized, and the instructor explains step by step.   I have studied computer science before and am an experienced programmer.  So, I did not pay, and finished the whole course in one week;one day for one chapter, but I recommend this course for everybody who wants to learn programming and Python.   You will learn what programming means by the end of the course, along with learning basic Python programming language.  "
2020-08-02,Akanksha P,5,0,"For users who don't really know what programming is. It's like taking the first baby steps towards learning to code. 

Python3 is the language taught, it's easy to use and also powerful.

Great instructor. Loved his way of teaching, his analogies was fun, and it classes seemed like live online classes rather than recorded ones. 

This is a really short course, covers all the basics. Those who already know looping etc, can skip. it's very basic. Those who have tablets or ipads can also take this course since it has inbuilt python playground and autograder."
2020-06-30,Brandon J H,5,0,"Everyone should have a basic understanding/coding class for general knowledge of what an awesome supplemental tool Python is. If you feel this is not something that can not aide you in your current studies or career I would strongly reconsider as seeing first hand in the ability to transform data, functions, expressions etc... has shown the limitless possibilities of Python. To be clear this is a very elementary beginners course which was perfect for someone who wants to dip a toe in the coding language pool without the fear of diving off the deep end."
2020-02-24,deadfish,5,0,"This course literally helps a lot! I only learned a little about programming when I was 12 or something, and of course I remembered nothing now. This course is really a good and easy way to start programming, because it's not only funny and easy to understand (mostly because Dr. Chuck is really cute and guiding), but also it provides dozens of simple project assignments to help students understand Python better. Anyway, I enjoyed this course so much that it only cost me 2 weeks to finish this. I think I'm going on to the next Python course right away!!"
2018-04-10,Jenai A,5,0,"Great beginner course, learned a lot and feel more confident in foundational python. I didn't study CS in college and only took a beginning CS class during my senior spring (learned java). A year and a half later, I took this course and it was very straightforward and the information was strongly reinforced through lecture videos, quizzes, assignments, and the textbook (definitely recommend reading the textbook).  I was able to finish all 7 weeks in 1 week, spending a couple hours a day on it. 
Will be continuing on to the other 4 courses in this class. "
2017-04-26,Joseph V,5,0,"I've taken online programming classes in the past, and this is by far the best. Dr. Chuck's curriculum covered concepts, constructs, and the basics of the language in a way that made learning a new language engaging and fun.  Content was covered in a way that kept me engaged (even though I've written a ton of code in VB and C#) while at the same time, the material was presented so that someone with no programming experience at all, could follow along and grasp all of the material ins plain English.
I am looking forward to the next course in this series."
2020-10-30,Fernanda C,5,0,"It is a very fun way to learn how to program in Python. This
course is well structured and the teacher has a very good pace. The quizzes and
assignments helped me absorb the content from each section. It made me feel
more confident about myself and be more prepared for the future. I am absolutely
sure that programming skills are going to be a basic demand from engineers in the near future and
I really want to feel prepared for it. Thank to this course I feel that I am in
the right path. The course “Python for everybody” has my highest
recommendation."
2020-10-03,Joseph G C,5,0,"  This course is an excellent course for anyone thinking of starting programming in Python. The course is well laid out and the testing is great. Trust me when I tell you the Prof is great. I love his conversational style. You feel as if you are in a one on one class. I had some struggles as I try to ingest the milk of Python programming but I think I did well so far. I preferred using the autograder than being assessed by my peers because the autograder can't confuse a 1 with a 0. What you put in is what you get. If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  "
2020-05-23,Ihtyaz K T,5,0,"The course is provides an excellent opportunity for newcomers who are oblivious to programming and who also, at the same time, are enthusiastic about programming (Python) and are willing to take some time off their daily lives and dedicate it to learning such a prominent programming language course. I'd like to extend my sincerest respects to Dr.Chuck (course instructor) for breaking down everything in such a simple manner for everyone's convenience. Would highly recommend that everyone, who's willing to learn Python enroll into this course.



Cheers."
2016-06-10,Mayakkannan S,5,0,"This is a well structured course for people who are beginners and have enough to attract people who have programming experience as well. I am a programmer with legacy background and perl, I enrolled to this course so that I can mentor my juniors at work on python; esp perl to python code conversion and attending this course is immensely satisfying from that objective. I will attend the other courses and probably build some materials so that I can cover the entire course 1-4 in a week.

Thanks Dr. Chuck and team from coursera and University of Michigan."
2020-01-01,Payal B,5,0,"This course is excellent! I loved the course content, the very interactive assignments, and especially the incredible Professor Charles Severance. Professor Severance does an incredible job unfolding programming for beginners, just starting out (like me). The content taught is mainly in the form of videos and the visuals really helped me understand the content very clearly. The assignments and quizzes are made to simply make sure one has been paying attention. They are not hard and not demotivating in the least. I am so very glad I took this course. "
2016-01-06,Colin S,5,0,"Great Professor and I really enjoyed the basic building block approach. It allowed me to learn slowly and completely while I took in all the new material. This was the perfect course for me since I had no prior programming knowledge at all. Thanks Dr. Chuck!
The only suggestion I have is to provide more exercises to really cement the lessons, similar to math class back in high school where you had to do multiple problems to see for yourself how different variations of the same types of problems work out. Although I may be alone in wishing for that!"
2021-05-28,Syed E,5,0,"This is my first ever programming course. I have not always been a big fan of programming. let me tell you how well-organized the course is. The instructor is outstanding, his approach towards the python is amazing. His teaching skills and techniques are off another level. The way he designed the assignment is difficult in a pleasing manner. So yeah, I must recommend you, if you are new to the programming world and more specifically python do enroll in this course at your earliest. So Thank you Coursera and Thank you University of Michigan. Peace"

2016-07-17,Dilrini R,5,0,"Dr. Severence does a great job of organizing the information in a manner that keeps me engaged, and knows when and how to describe common errors in logic and how to avoid/fix them.  The accompanying text is similarly engaging and informative; it manages to explain quite a few concepts in each chapter, without being an overwhelming amount of information.  I feel I am getting a great functional (vs. heavily theoretical) introduction to programming concepts and the Python language.  The exercises have ingrained the material covered in the lectures. "
2020-09-11,Johnny M,5,0,"This is a great intro course for programming.  You will be glad to realize how much you have learned after completing the course.  For a complete novice without any knowledge or experience in the field, it's natural to feel a bit overwhelmed at times because there are so much new materials.  It will require some patience because you're going to get stuck at some point during the assignments but when you figure it out, it feels pretty darn good.  It's a journey and it will take some time so might as well have fun and enjoy the process.  Cheers!!"
2020-07-29,John,5,0,"Great course! If you are new to programming, this is a low stress way to get the knowledge you need to take each step towards learning how and why. I saw a review that said all you do is copy and paste code, I can tell you, I have taken courses like that, this is not that type of course at all. You don't get the answers to problems and just retype them, you have to take them farther on your own; so maybe the course has been updated since then. If you want to learn how to program and want to start at the basics, this is the course to start with. "
2020-05-07,Dr. V J,5,0,"Hi All,


Thank you so much Prof. Christopher Brooks for his excellent way of presentation of each topic covered in this course. Great experience .... Excellent Mentor. ...This is my first attempt in online learning and joined for a course in coursera. I enjoyed a lot.. I am a beginner in Python programming and I completed the course and completed all the assignments and Quiz with 100% grade. Also the course helped me to acquaint myself with the interesting methods of teaching by which teachers can interact with students through online platforms."
2016-06-23,Jason B,5,0,"I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well. I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook. However, after taking this course, I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general.
My only criticism is that the course still uses an older version of Python which has some differences and can make the learning frustrating if you are not aware of those differences. Granted, with a free textbook for an older version this is a minor issue thus far in the series."
2020-07-29,Talitha S F,5,0,"Muito bom o curso! O Dr. Chuck é ótimo, muito didático. Os vídeos complementares são incríveis, ensinaram muita coisa. Fazendo todos os exercícios e praticando no próprio computador dá pra fixar bem o que foi ensinado no curso e fazer aplicações, nem que sejam simples. Muito bom!
Very good course! Dr. Chuck is great, very didactic. The complementary videos are incredible, they taught a lot. Doing all the exercises and practicing on the computer, you can fix what was taught in the course and make applications, even if they are simple. Very good!  "
2020-04-14,Rhiddhi P D,5,0,"really easy to do even for a 14 year old.
I really can't believe that I did this course in less than about 5 hours, and the course was of 7 weeks!
Actually somebody gave it to me as a challenge to complete this course in 2 days..... I did it in 5 hours.
If you provide me with a special achievement like a special certificate or something else for me as I did it so fast with 100% marks, then it'll be nice.. :-)
Thanks for providing me such a beautiful course. I'll be happy if you provide me with some other courses too as financial aid.

Thanks again🙂"
2020-04-20,arman,5,0,Dr Charles is really a good teacher in Python. His presentation skills are encouraging for beginners like me in this particular language and it is also enjoyable. I was struggling to learn this language and have searched for several resources online but none of them were able to make me comprehend the basics of Python. I am happy that I have come across this course taught by Dr Charles. I have already completed the first one of the specialization and hoping to continue with the remaining ones which will help me gain valuable skills in Python.
2016-10-12,orobosa o,5,0,"As annoying as the auto-grader was at times, I still enjoyed the course. The material was properly presented and curated which goes to say a lot of blood, tears and sweat was definitely put into the course. I highly recommend this course for beginning programmers and/ or more experienced programmers who many want to familiarize themselves with python syntax or get a refresher.  A big thank you to the team and the initiatives behind this course most especially Professor Severance who has a unique style and engaging style of content delivering. "
2018-07-31,Katherine E,5,0,Awesome instructor and lots of great resources to aid in understanding - such as discussion boards and assignments using the code grader tool. I really liked seeing the instructor interact with the slides. This helped my understanding the concepts. I do not have a programming background although I am in IT operations. The course was very accessible and I look forward to the remaining courses of Python for Everybody.  I recommend it to anyone with no experience in programming looking to get started in Python. Thank you Dr. Chuck and Coursera! 
2020-04-30,Divyanshu S,5,0,"This course is just awesome. Dr.Chuck tries his best to make every concept clear and rememberable.
Absolutely this course is a beginner who wants to start the programming. If you are a beginner and have no prior about programming stuff, then the course is for you. Quizzes, assignments, and other exercises help you to understand things thoroughly. Believe me you are going to enjoy the whole lectures .Dr.Chuck has also added some other stuffs which makes this course more interesting. Thank you Dr.Chuck for creating 'Programming for everybody'.

2016-11-25,Gavin C,5,0,"A really nice, gentle introduction to the basics of the Python language. I was already familiar with much of it from previous endeavours at learning to code, so managed to get through each week in about an evening's work, but it didn't 'feel right' to jump into the second course straight away. The last programming assignment caused a little bit of head scratching, and re-highlighted the need for careful, precise thinking when writing even short pieces of code. I've enjoyed this course and will be back for the Data Structures module soon :)"
2020-07-12,Carlos A,5,0,"Dicen que cuando quieres aprender a programar con ponerte a leer algún libro sobre el lenguaje que quieres aprender y practicar te ayuda pero este curso realmente te anima, te motiva te enseña de una manera divertida y que te mantiene con esa necesidad de querer saber mas, lo mas que había escrito antes del curso era un hola mundo y ahora después de curso entendí como hacer funciones hice algunas para mis ejercicios y sobre todo jamas pensé que programar fuera divertido, gracias por este curso y a todos los que hicieron que fuera posible!"
2020-04-28,Emily L,5,0,"I went into this course not having any previous experience with programming and finished it being able to write some basic code which was tremendously satisfying. The material was presented in a simple enough manner that no experience was needed to get started. While I'm guessing Spyder was not used for simplicity's sake, I would recommend it rather than running command prompt. It picks up on basic errors (like a missing parenthesis) which cuts down on the time you spend running the entire code and then having it fail for something silly.  "
2019-10-22,Mark P,5,0,"Great starter course.  Platform has some bugs loading videos and the code editor is very finicky to spaces and tabs even if you write it directly in the assignment editor provided.  Best practice is to use your own editor, run the code in the command prompt like the instructor suggests, and then paste your code from atom or whatever into the assignment editor.  Also, the discussion forums reply section is buggy and wrote my response vertically which was very strange and should get fixed.  Otherwise good course and good pace for beginners."
2021-05-17,MUHAMMAD K U,5,0,"I love the course, video lectures, slides, books every material was awesome, I really feel awesome after completing this course while studying university semester too as i managed my time very well and i am looking forward to take more courses in the specilization of python too as well as other courses from coursera too. This course will not only help me in my further study but will boost my confident and will seperate me from others while appearing for the jobs too. Thanks university of michigon and coursera for such an awesome course "
2021-03-07,Gavin T,5,0,"As a first timer with code and programming, this was a very fun and thorough introduction. I'm not looking to be a CS major, but I would like to build my skills with Python for my own projects. I feel a lot more confident about venturing into Python and other coding tutorials now. 
I think it's also important to praise the course structure and design. This was one of the easiest to follow online courses I've ever taken. Very logical flow and easy to find resources. Thanks for making this so accessible to students of all different types."
2016-05-10,Timothy A C,5,0,"Great course for a beginner. Instructor and student assistants make sure that you get the basics and (most important) grasp the concepts behind the code. This is very important because next to the keywords and syntax the most crucial thing to be learned is to start ""thinking"" like a programmer. How to break it down to the necessary incremental steps. 
I personally like the combination of video lecture, on-line student notes and on-line lab. Getting Python installed locally is a breeze for Windows or Linux. Already enrolled in Course 2!!"
2020-06-26,Hardik G,5,0,"This is literally the best course for anyone who is starting with Python as a completely new programming language.It is super easy to flow and can be too easily learned by anyone who has zero background in programming and has tried it for the very first time.Prof. Chuck is the best professor in the lot.I haven't seen anyone do this good of a job.I swear on God he is literally the best teacher at the moment.I had tried my hand on a few Python courses previously but there is no one even close to Prof. Chuck .HE IS THE BEST,NO KIDDING!"
2020-03-26,Brett K,5,0,"I knew almost nothing about programming and now I know a little something! Starts out very easy, and gradually becomes challenging. Nothing too aggravating in the assignments, just don't be afraid to take your time, re-watch the lecture videos, read the chapter, and try to tackle the assignment again. I am preparing to go back to school for a Database Analyst certification at my local college, and I thought this would be a good way to get exposure to the types of languages I'm going to be seeing in the future. On to the next course!"
2018-06-03,Adityavikram T,5,0,"I'm already familiar with coding, in languages like C, C++ and Java. But starting from scratch for a new language like Python was cool. Prof. Chuck engaged the viewer quite effectively and i appreciate that. Solving periodic quizzes helped me be reassured that i knew what was being taught in the course. This course takes its due time to teach us various concepts in Python and in no place did i feel that something was rushed through without proper explanation. So all in all, it's a good course to start off one's journey in Python. 
. "
2015-11-26,Mustafa K,5,0,"A very good content with additional inspiring interviews. Names on it, it is getting started course, it is giving foundations of Python. Because I have some programming background in Java, I have completed it in a week without skipping anything. Dr. Charles Severance makes his job very well and more importantly in very enjoying way :). I'm looking forward to taking next Python course from him. Last but not least, very thanks to Coursera for providing us accessing top class courses in free of charge. Best wishes for all from Turkey."
2020-11-13,光嘟肥航,5,0,"I really like this courses by professor Charles, I was a chinese student and this actually is the first time I learn programming language. Professor Charles really give us an interesting courses and arise my interest towards programming. Sometimes I really desire to complete the video and do the assignment. This is really fresh for the financial management student like me. So in a nutshell, I highly appreciate the courses by professor Charles, and thanks for you patient teaching. I will keep learning the Python to build up myself.
 "
2016-12-26,Cris G,5,0,"Great intro to Python. I've had some formal training in C++, MATLAB, and I completed the codecademy section of Python a while back. This was a nice re-introduction to Python, but more formal. The only complaint I have is with the grader. I had no issues running my programs from my terminal, but the grader kept giving me indentation issues. Not sure what the problem was, but it was a pain to deal with considering the code worked in other places. Aside from that the lectures are quick and helpful and the examples are helpful as well"
2020-12-17,DIMITRIOS P,5,0,Truth is I was a little afraid as far as programming is concerned. That was just a week ago. But with this course of lessons I have now developed a huge interest for python and programming in general. Its like riddles waiting to  be solved. And riddles are fun. A huge shout out for Dr. Chuck who made this course so much understandable for us beginners as well as fun to deal with and to all others who contributed to it. If only professors around the world were so much passionate in what the do. On my way to the next python course!
2017-09-08,Saikat M,5,0,"I'm very happy because of the way the whole session has made progress. It is easy to understand because of the way things were explained. You are an awesome teacher!!!

Just one little/tiny concern i.e. before explaining what is list, I saw the course started using list. If a little insight of list would have been provided in the course, it could have been a 100% complete course.But anyways, without that it's 99.99% satisfactory though. :)

Again, thanks for having this very helpful course to build Python base of the learners strong. "
2021-08-01,Mr. B,5,0,"I am a music teacher trying to change careers. Other than some html that I learned from freecodecamp, I have no other experience coding.
This course walks you through the material in a very careful way to ensure that you understand every element of the material. Professor Severance relays information in a very accessible way complete with visuals and analogies.
I was able to finish this course in 2 days. Granted, I spent more than 20 hours total, but I wiped it out over the weekend. Each week can be easily done in about 2-4 hours."
2020-06-01,Helen E P,5,0,"thus far, best programming class I have ever taken. Nice mix of humor, he explains what works and what doesn't, why and how to fix it. The programs are geared around at least something along the lines of real word problems. I also love that you are taught straight off how to install python and encouraged to do your assignments on your computer, but if not possible can do it just on the browser until you are ready to turn in, then just copy and paste your code. Another big plus is he introduces command line to get you used to it"
2019-07-23,Joan M C,5,0,"Good introduction to Python and programming. I learned the basics of 3 other languages in the 80's (FORTRAN, Pascal and elementary assembly language), so programming is not new for me. Since it has been so long since I have written a program I started with PY4E to dust off the cobwebs.  the video lessons were clear and mildly entertaining - which made it fun to learn. The assignments and quizzes were purposeful, because they help clarify subtleties and encourage practice.
I am planning on taking the next course in the sequence."
2018-08-25,Matthew A,5,0,"Great introductory course! I have very ""rusty"" experience with programming, but I am familiar with logic and computing terms. I feel like if you had very little ""command line"" experience in your past, you may need to learn a little before starting. But there is enough ""walking through"" it in this course that you will get it at least through literally doing exactly what's on the screen.
The instructor is awesome - great sense of humor, and teaches in a way that doesn't speak ""down"" to you, or too academic. I enjoyed this course."
2018-08-20,Mayur E R B,5,0,"I am a programmer for more than 15 years, and took this initiative to learn Python.



Couldn't have chosen a better course to get started. Even though this course is for the beginners, it made me rethink some of the basic constructs of a language afresh.



I had learnt the other languages like C#, Java, JavaScript etc, in a very haphazard manner and as and when required.



This course presents a pleasantly new way of learning a new language. Thanks Dr Chuck, also for all those interesting bonus videos at the end of each chapter!

"
2020-02-17,Paula A Q G,5,0,"This is a great and useful course if you want to get started in the programming world. The information is well presented in the lectures as in the book, which has a kind reading. Now that I have learned the basics of programming and I am starting to know this language of Python, I feel more excited to learn more and more to achieve my purpose of working with artificial intelligence in the psychological area. There are many things to come and this course has everything to offer to get you excited about learning more and more. "
2017-11-18,Alfredo H,5,0,"  Amazing and easy to understand. I really enjoyed the methodology and even laughed at some classes. The professor explains everything in a thorough manner, and the teaching staff is always out there to help you as well. It gets even easier to learn if you also try to answer your questions through other means: google, the Python website, the course textbook, etc. I did not have any previous knoledge on any programming language and I surely reccomend this course to anyone willing to learn their way through computer programming.  "
2019-07-10,Priya s k,5,0,"  For me the best thing about the course was Professor Chuck's approach towards teaching programming. Although, I have an engineering background, I had always avoided programming related jobs because my computer science teachers had instilled a fear of programming in me. On the contrary, Professor Chuck made learning python a fun experience which really helped me overcome my fear of programming. Thanks to this course, my confidence grew significantly and I was able to delve deeper into more advanced python programming topics."
2020-04-10,Mengdi Z,5,0,Excellent introductory course! The lecturer delivers the course in a progressive way and covers diverse content including the software development background. Some beginners (like me) tend to be easily intimidated by hardcore difficult-to-understand programming languages and lose interest and confidence before even start to write the first line of code. But the ideas proposed by Dr. Severance in the first lesson make me stick to it for a little longer when I am frustrated by having written the wrong code in the assignment.
2019-01-31,jaideep c,5,0,"This course was the first actual course for Programming that I understood.
In my college, I had taken classes for C, C++, but never understood.
But in this online course, the way Dr. chuck (Charles Severance) explained and maintained a beautiful connectivity , i never felt i was learning a Programming language.
Infact, he did not just helped to learn the Python basic, but removed my fear about a programming language by clearing the basics/ concepts that any language would use.
Hats off to him for his beautiful, beautiful work."
2016-12-08,Punartha,5,0,"Learnt basics of Python programming. This is a fantastic course for anyone who comes from a non programming or non computer science background like me. And Dr Charles is an awesome teacher. He makes learning easy by keeping the course interactive and constantly motivating and encouraging students. I, who was always scared of coding, thoroughly enjoyed this course and would love to continue the next courses by Dr Charles. Thankyou so much Professor for teaching us the easiest and the best way to approach problems/questions."
2021-09-30,Sindhu P,5,0,"This is one of the most fundamental and basic programming course that I have ever done. Dr.Chuck is a brilliant professor/teacher. He conveys the fundamentals in a very interesting, fun manner in the most palatable way to any non-programmer. He has this amazing ability to make concepts into byte size forms that is easily understood. Even though I do have programming background I enjoyed this course thoroughly and the interviews/office hours meet were all very good. The interviews were highly illuminating and informative."
2020-07-25,Vaishnavi R G,5,0,"While registering to curse after recommended by my college  I actually thought it could be a typical 

course with lectures and tests.. but I was completely wrong! The course was so interesting that I 

completed it within a week! Dr. Chuck sure knows how to engage students. It has not only engaging 

lectures but also interesting quiz, assignments and office hour videos in which Dr. Chuck lets us 

meet our peers. This is a course where learning meets fun  :)  I highly recommend it to everyone who 

wants to learn coding!!"
2020-06-12,Kartavya Z,5,0,"One of the best course I ever had,I have started this course ti boost my knowledge in programming add mainly I want to do ai as my career so I do this course of python and it is the best course for me ,I found many different thing which are very useful in thi ,and as we all know this is a course from the most reputable university and so there professor are remarkably nice and I love teaching with them and get this knowledge, I am satisfied by doing course and it is more good then I expected so no words for this as well"
2016-02-08,Adan B,5,0,"Hello i am Adan Bae. I am from korea. How are you today!?
This class is very very awesome and useful for me!!!
Because i wanted to learn the Python, but it is not famous language in korea.
So i looked up the class in the MOOC and Coursera
Finally i could meet the Dr. Chuck's class. then i tried to hard to understand his class.
Because i don't have good English skill. 
But i did it!! I got it!
Thank you Dr. Chuck and Everyone who made this class alot!!
I really hope to meet you wherever Korea or America. 
See you in next class!! "
2018-12-12,Herb R,5,0,"Dr. Chuck presents the subject matter in an easy to understand way.  The overall course design is very well thought out.  The video lectures have excellent graphics; the lectures follow the outline of the text book.  I particularly valued the ability to reschedule my class; if my job and other activities in life get super demanding, it was very nice to know I had flexibility with this course (although I did not exercise it).  I could not be happier with this course.  Well Done Dr. Severance and University of Michigan!"
2020-07-11,Tanmoy B,5,0,"I have always wanted to learn Python and get started towards a new journey in my career. And being a Mechanical Engineer by profession and degree, I always feared whether I would understand programming or not, and I was very confused about where I can start. I am really glad that I chose this particular course, to begin with, and Dr. Chuck Severance is an excellent instructor, and he sort of guided me through all the tiny and granular details of Python in this basic course! I am super excited to start the next phase!"
2020-07-03,Thanakrit L,5,0,"I personally have no background information about programming. For me, this a great introduction to python. I recommend downloading 'pycharm' to run the script without saving numerous time and try to run it on Terminal (Mac). Or you can use ATOM writer to edit the script but to run it you can either tun it in terminal like what the instructor do to practice or by installing terminal package but for me it doesn't work. In long term it is super annoying to do that. PyCharm is free and also tell you what you did wrong.
"
2016-02-14,Ken R,5,0,"This introductory course to the Python programming language boosted my confidence in my ability to learn programming for data analysis. Without any prior background in programming and just a bit of algebra several years ago in college, I was able to make it through this course fairly easily. The time estimate for each week accurately reflected the amount of time required for me to complete an assignment. After completing this first course in the Specialization, I decided to sign-up for the entire five-course series."
2020-04-17,Iordanis L,5,0,Clear and to the point introduction to Python. I am glad i took this course. It set solid foundations for continuing on the Python path. I must stress out though the fact that one needs to do the exercises to fully appreciate the work the instructor has put in. During the exercises I would recollect on the lecture and that made it easier to complete the work. For me reading a book alone would not have cut it. I needed Dr. Chuck to explain it the way he did. Looking forward to the second class of the specialization.
2020-10-28,Yogi H C,5,0,"  Dr Chuck is one of the best lecturer you could get to teach you Python. He truly understands what beginners need to help them understand the subject better. The class material is so easy to access and easy to understand. Every explanation needed is on the book they curated for this course. And that is one of the signs that they are really put a lot of effort to ease our learning experience. Certainly will taking the next course for Python. Thank you Michigan University, dr. Chuck and teams who curated this course.  "
2020-06-27,Abhishek T,5,0,"This is the first ever programming course for me .It is my good fortune that I started with Python, that many regard as good language to begin with and most importantly the instructor and content of this course, is top class. The way Dr. Charles Severance takes you through this course as to how someone will teach you to walk for the first time, holding your fingers. Some may like this approach, some may not , but for a person like myself who is totally alien to the world of programming, this was the best approach. "
2019-01-22,Patricia Z,5,0,"Loved the pace and how the lessons were broken down. The buildup from one lesson to another was really good and super great for beginners. I also love how the professor explains a lot of things in a very friendly manner (i.e. not condescending, not too advanced, etc.). The last exercise challenged me quite a bit, but looking through forums really helped. At the end of the day, it at least prepares you on how to deal with getting frustrated with code that doesn't work. Can't wait to get started on the next courses!"
2021-06-14,Barry S,5,0," The big thing for me was the shock that I could understand!
T​he first couple of videos, however, were irritating because I had already ""understood"" the hardware, but I got past that irritation when I remembered that this was a course for Beginners. I am a Beginner in programming but not in use of a computer.
M​y later feelings were that I was being honoured as an adult: learn by listening, learn by doing, learn by making mistakes...AND ""It's OK. You'll get it eventually."" A great catch-cry!
T​hank you to Dr. Chuck!"
2020-06-03,Daria K,5,0,"Very very good explonation about everything. I liked a lot, that in the first section there is an explanation about hard parts of computer. I think for everyone, who starts coding, it is very important to have this understanding. 
Charles explaines everything so good and so easy to understand, I could not wish for something better.  For me, as a beginner, this course was very helpful and gave me the feeling, what is it like to code with Python. Looking forward to other parts of Python for Everybody Specialization.
"
2015-10-03,Alejandro M,5,0,"Best course of Python I've taken so far. Tried with MITx's Intro to Computer Science and learnpythonthehardway.org, without success. The learning curve was too steep. This one, on the other hand, progresses slowly and easily, but in the end, after a month or two you find yourself writing short programs in Python, which actually work. Won't make you an expert, but it will help you to understand the general logic of the language, and start coding for real. Took me about a month to finish it. I highly recommend it. "
2020-01-09,Karan S,5,0,"  I have to say, this is the best course that is available(according to my research) in any of the online platforms. It has a well-defined structure and everything is so beginner-friendly. The teacher, Professor Charles Severance, amazing guy. When he is teaching, it's like he is talking to you directly and not to a camera. The introduction is so good that it makes you comfortable with the course easily. So, if you are looking to learn Python language and are confused about where to start from, this is the place.  "
2015-12-06,Katarzyna S,5,0,"This course is my first encouter with programming and I really enjoy it. The lecturer's way of explanation is very clear and simple. I did not expect to become so interested in it, however, learning Python turned out to be a fresh and great experience. Thanks to Dr Chuck it is real fun to learn Python. You can get through this course even if you think you are not very good at mathemathics (personal experience). I recommend this course to everybody who is interested in beginning their adventure with programming."
2017-08-26,Aakriti S,5,0,"  A great introduction to basic programming concepts and Python language. The instructor, Dr Chuck, is really good and explains the concepts in a manner easy to understand even for beginners. For me, personally, the bonus material was the most interesting with the expert interviews (look out for the talk with the inventor of Python). The short videos of other Coursera students meeting Dr Chuck helped me feel connected to the student community. Overall, a must-do course if you want to learn programming in Python.  "
2020-12-12,刘见微,5,0,"The coure is friendly to any person who wants to step in the python study and the teacher always make me laugh at class for his vivid metaphors which stimulates my interest in programming learning. Also, for a Chinese student who tries her first time to listen to a whole-English and professional course, it's challenging but fruitful. I will keep studying the following course after i finish my final exam. At last, thanks to the teacher and every assitant teacher for preparing such amazing class for everybody."
2019-10-30,SOURAV S,5,0,This course is an excellent course for those who know a little bit of programming and also a very good course for those who are just starting to learn programming. The instructor of the course Sir Charles Severance has explained the concepts in a very easy way and the assignments and review questions makes them more clearer. I think that if anyone is looking for a course in Python from scratch he can go with this course and further with the specialization to get all the basic and advanced concepts of Python. 
2015-12-10,Keith M,5,0,"Wonderfully composed and paced course.  Dr. Severance does a fantastic job of scaling technical descriptions from basic terminology up to the specific programming jargon.  The assignments are well detailed, explained, and the technology in the course works well.  The book is free and also a treat because it ties so nicely back into the course materials making is probably the best learning Python book available today based on what I've seen.  Thank you for continuing to support this program.  It is FANTASTIC."
2019-12-04,wivai,5,0,"this course is wonderful! It includes so many details that usually a beginner won't notice or understand why can and why can't.This course has helped me to save the time for trial mistakes and taught me to keep a good coding behaviour.After each chapter,there is one or two coding assignments. Every time, I watch the explanation video and compare my codes in my assignment. While there are some codes I don't understand very well during the course video, I'll stop and try the codes.That makes me learned a lot."
2021-02-14,Danielle D C,5,0,This course is excellent with everything being simplified and concise. It reminded me of learning the beginning stages of Pascal and how fluent you became in the language; especially when writing/constructing basic functions. Whether you have crossed paths with a programming language previously or not doesn't matter. You are able to quickly pick up the basics of Python's control flow and the short quizzes & assignments help in solidifying these concepts. Kudos to Charles Severance and the rest of the team!
2015-09-29,Suruchi F,5,0,"Great Python Course for beginners. I wish we had Coursera when I was first learning programming. I am not new to programming but I still found the course very useful to get a head-start with Python language. All credits to Charles to keep the course interesting, informative and at the same time very simple to understand. I would highly recommend this course to anyone new to programming (any language) and Python beginners.
Kudos to Prof. Charles and Coursera community for an amazing experience! 

Best,

2021-11-10,BAVIRISHETTY V,5,0,basically im very dumb when charles sir told in the beginning u don't need any prerequisites regarding this course this course everybody then one day sir came to class with sorting hat then i thought this class will be simple and understanding now im able to answer the quiz and when it comes to assignment at first i felt very frustated but after sir had also mentioned that when u get traceback error u feel very frustated but if keep going u will enjoy thanks to charles sir love u 3000 for the explaination
2021-08-19,Mohammed S K,5,0,"I have been a trainer earlier on in my career before shifting to programming. In my career therefore I have attended many trainings and courses both classroom sessions and online lessons. I can say without a shed of doubt that this is one of the best courses I have ever attended. Dr. Severance is an outstanding trainer, the course is very well structured, explained in an extremely lucid and simple language with real life example such that even my school going kids can learn it without any support from me.

2020-11-23,Antons S,5,0,"I just want to suggest for Coursera about saving the notes in video. My suggestion is to save not next sentences what instructor said, but previous, becuase, obviously, you want to save what you just heard but not what you about to hear. Because you just simply dont know what you will hear, but when you just heard something you be like ""Alright, I want to save this, this was important to me"". Hope you understand. Otherwise - the course is perfect and Charles Russell Severance did fantastic job. Thank you!"
2019-11-13,Erikk S,5,0,"This is a great course. I've tried many and this is probably my favorite. I read another review about how people didn't like the first lesson of his course but I disagree full-heartedly. You cannot start coding without noting the context or at least, not be good at it. Its like the math component of coding; if you don't know certain calculus and discrete foundations, you will struggle with any type of advanced computer science foundations (AI, data science, etc). Great course, good teacher, all inclusive."
2018-05-12,Scott S,5,0,"This is definitely a course for someone who is a total beginner to Python and to coding. It was a bit too simple for me (since I have been programming in other languages for many years). But I wanted a course that would take things slowly rather than teach all the syntax of Python in a week or 2, so I am doing the 5 course specialization. Loved the instructor--he is very good at explaining coding in basic terms. This course is perfect for someone who has never coded before and wants to learn from scratch."
2015-12-07,Ashkan J,5,0,"It was the best ""getting started with python"" that I've ever seen! I always like to learn anything slowly but deeply, and this course was a nice start to learn python.
Thank you Dr Severence.
...
And about coursera, I'm from Iran and I hope coursera will add my country to its countries name for whom that want a certificate...I do not understand its word: ""learning for everybody"" how can be possible when it neglects some people!
I liked everything about this course, but I do not like this about whole coursera."
2017-10-09,Liz T,5,0,"This is the course I've been missing for the past few years as I tried to learn Python through other ""Fundamentals"" courses. Here Dr. Chuck really takes it slow and explains all the concepts. In other courses they might have 2 or 3 really basic lessons and then speed picked up to where I was lost. Not here. A couple of the assignments got a little challenging, but mentors gave hints to get me on the right path. Highly recommend for anyone new to programming or (like me) who never felt confident about it."

2020-04-04,Adham K,5,0,"  It is a well-explained course especially for beginners. If it is your first time learning to program you will not feel like you are struggling to understand anything. And if you have some experience with programming I assure you that you will never feel bored at any point in the course.Every week of the course Dr. Chuck will explain a chapter from the book ""Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in python three"". So, I recommend you to read the chapter after watching the videos and before taking the quiz."
2020-09-06,Jomar J,5,0,This is the first MOOC I've completed since I started enrolling to various ones in 2013. Professor Severance is very easy to listen to and he makes the discussion easy to comprehend for total beginners like me. The course is not as rigorous as I expected it to be but it covered the basics of Python. This course is truly great for those who doesn't have a programming background that needs to have an appreciation of programming for their work. I will continue working on the specialization after this one. 
2017-02-27,John M B,5,0,"This was an excellent course. The title implies anyone (to include those
 with no prior programming knowledge) can do it. Thankfully, that proved
 to be true. I do consider myself tech savvy but I have never spent 
anytime learning a programming language until now. The book was nice to 
have, heck, even free for Kindle or downloadable PDF at the time I took 
the course. Dr. Chuck breaks down the book and makes it so simple and 
laid back... I look forward to the next part of his Python 
specialization!

2020-05-04,Jubayer h,5,0,"I am very glad at this course. The teacher was very interesting and friendly. He teaches us in a friendly way,in the most effective way. And in future I want to learn more from coursera. I think we are blessed to get a platform like coursera. The beat part is , it is arranging many type of courses for us. And I was sponsored by my university (BUET). After all thanks my university for offering this type of course in free. I want to give thanks for the next courses that I am going to take from coursera."
2020-05-02,Ronald H,5,0,Love the course! thank you so much for your help. Some feedback would be to have something in the corners of code written saying true statement code or false statement code if the code is faulty. I take notes by taking pictures of the example and in reviewing them I had to go back to the video to remind myself some codes presented as an example were false and faulty. Other then that I had a blast and I was always happy to take a class due to how fun and well explained everything was. Thank  you again!
2019-09-10,Chichi Z,5,0,"I love this course and it deserves reviewing because the teaching content provided by Dr Charles is easy and quick to understand so that I could figure out how to apply those reserved words for assignments after one or two times studying.  I think this course is worth the best praise and sets a good example for e-education courses. Thank you, Dr Charles, you managed to make lessons lively, active and methodical like a suspense film that always makes me desperately desire to know what is the next step. "
2018-04-01,Ryan U,5,0,"The course was excellent, I had done a small amount of programming on my own before this but never went over the computer science aspect so I'm glad we had a few intro videos lightly touching on that. (I also picked up a few additional things like try/except and the break/continue function) In the future i would like to see the answers given to the quizzes after each quiz is completed. Other then that the course was excellent and i will continue to take them. Prof. Severances videos were very helpful."
2018-03-22,Bryan V,5,0,"This was the best programming course I've taken. I have taken a few programming courses before and never finish them. This one I actually finished and actually learned a lot from it. Dr. Severance is the best professor I have ever taken a class from. He really is very thorough in what he is teaching. He explains things multiple times in multiple different ways for you to understand exactly what he is talking about. You never feel lost while taking this class, everything is so engrained into your head."
2021-01-30,SHARNALI A,5,0,I really enjoyed this course. The professor made us feel like we were really in his class in person by being very interactive throughout the course. His transition from using layman's terms at the beginning to using specialized terms was very smooth and therefore it was easy to pick up. My only suggestion would be to have videos for weekly assignments with windows as well - as there are differences between settings in windows and mac (windows user here) so it takes a bit more time for me to catch up. 
2020-08-12,Ryan S C F,5,0,"Took this course after a 20 year gap from first learning to program in college. It's a great refresher, easy to follow and explained very well by Prof Severance. One note, the course is an introduction to programming with a backdrop of Python, not an intro to Python and how it differs from other coding languages. That's probably obvious to many, but I realized this a little late. I guess I was initially searching for a more advanced course, but glad that I landed here to start on a firmer foundation."
2019-11-10,Abhijeet G,5,0,"It has been an amazing journey so far with learning Python programming. I am enjoying this learning process a lot. Also, I would like to mentioned that Charles Severance has been teaching the subject in really an interactive way where he asks to pause the video to brainstorm on certain problem and then come back to the video where he explains the solution in a step by step way. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan for giving me this opportunity to do this course and giving me the financial aid."
2019-09-14,Hariharan S,5,0,"It was a fantastic learning experience. This is apparently my first online course on Coursera and what a way to start with Dr. Chuck's class. He was fantastic, always interesting and never boring/distracting even for a bit. The way he handled the lectures was definitely a testament to how experienced he is, in handling first-time programmers/learners of a new language/script. I am sure I would take a lot of courses in the future. Already looking forward to my next one, as I write this review. Cheers! "
2020-10-12,Syed M A B A,5,0,This course was exceptional primarily because of the instructor Dr Charles whose teaching was in detail and he helps you pick up fundamental and difficult concepts  quickly and easily. He for sure is a god gifted teacher. I will always be indebted to him for teaching me Python  and this amazing course which helped me put my knowledge to test and helped me to learn efficiently and I really enjoyed the process! :))) I hope that we become the teachers of this and other programming language like him. :)
2020-08-11,Emma S,5,0,"This is a great course for beginners! I have a background in biology, but no prior programming experience. I have been interested in learning more about the intersection of these two fields, so this course was a great starting point.  I cannot stress enough that this was a very high quality and well-designed course! The online lectures are very good and the professor is great at explaining concepts for beginners. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about this topic and completing the practice assignments. "
2020-05-13,HARIKRISHNA J P,5,0,"Absolutely amazing. I would not be surprised if people found that as an understatement. The instructor is enthusiastic and well versed in his field. He ensures that all the necessary details and knowledge required is given out to the students in the most professional and engaging manner. If you are new to programming , then look no further , for you have found the perfect place to start . I am so excited and cannot wait to progress further in this specialization course. My thanks to you Dr. Charles."
2019-07-24,Robert C,5,0,"This course is terrific for beginners.  I have never programmed anything in my life, but the instruction was great and definitely suited for someone who has never had exposure to Python (or programming, more generally speaking).  Thumbs up to Dr. Chuck for creating a terrific learning experience (great videos, web content, even a downloadable textbook).  I wanted to learn Python, and deciding which Python course to take on Coursera was difficult, but I have no regrets about enrolling in this course.
"
2018-12-01,Azmat J,5,0,"Great work done by the instructor Doctor Charles Severance, Thank You!
It is the best course of the beginners who want to start learning python, it covers basic condition, function, loops and iteration , material are very easy, teacher explained each and every topic in an easy way, easy to understand, exercise and quiz are easy to attempt all are according to the course contents. I will recommend to add more practice exercises. Overall it is the best course for the first step towards learning python.  
 "
2020-08-13,Alejandro R O,5,0,"  This course is ideal for people who has no prior programming experience. As the professor says himself, this is a course you should take before any introductory course in programming, as the professor guides you through the intuition and logic behind the core aspects of any programming language. The assignments can be challenging, but they are doable. If you want to have a first approach to programming while having no prior experience, this is a must to take. Plus, the professor is really engaging!  "
2020-06-17,Fadl I,5,0,"I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Python from scratch. I was new to programming and this course has helped me think like a programmer. Even though I paused halfway through the course for a lengthy period, I was able to return to it and complete it successfully. I will be continuing on to do the second part of the course because the tutor has superior teaching skills. I've now started learning C programming through a weekly evening class and I'm finding it quite easy."
2019-01-17,MICHAEL D S,5,0,This course is well-explained and detailed. The sections flow from one to another without issue. The final programming assignment requires the student to put the different pieces together and is more comprehensive than previous sections. Always try to diagram / flowchart your process to help you through this course. It is enjoyable once you're able to get through it. I would highly recommend this course for aspiring Python programmers. I'm sure it's more basic for those with programming experience. 
2017-11-11,Helen S,5,0,"I am a parent with programming experience with C++ and PHP. I take this course together with my 14 years old daughter. I wish her to learn Python and I am sort of safeguard her along the way. She has no prior experience with any computer language and programming. But she is doing fine. She has picked up Python language rules and overcome minor problem by herself. The course is very beginner friendly. I am now progressing into the next course: Python Data Structure, and my daughter is still with me."
2015-12-31,OmegaNerdSupreme O,5,0,"Melhor curso de todos. Pena que possuo uma internet péssima, que não tem a capacidade de carregar os vídeos. Sendo assim, não posso ter acesso as matérias educacionais. O coursera é um site muito bom, mas é dedicado apenas à usuários com internet rápida, e não dão valor à usuários com internet deficiente, como a minha. Por isso, gostaria que novas modificações possam ser realizadas no site, tendo a capacidade de oferecer qualidade nos vídeos mesmo para usuários com poucos recursos, como a internet."
2020-07-19,Jorgeduardo D L,5,0,"  Taking this course was like hitting a fortunate reset button for me because I had already taken some programming courses at the National University of Colombia, but I didn't quite understand some details in the most basic structures. I am very happy with how I understand python now, but more importantly, I feel that there is a lot of fun in building code that I am really excited about going forward. Thanks a lot professor Chuck! , you are indeed one of those people changing the world for better :D  "

it is simple and best for those programers . it have different practice activities and also quize out of 10 which is good to test my understanding of the course. if i give soo much aprciation to this course ,i am happy but i am not efficient in english that is why i say this comment only. anyways python is my faborite subject after this i will learn different programs using python programing. thanks!!"
2020-04-22,Nicolas P,5,0,"I think the video where the professor uses the ""cd"", ""pwd"", and ""-l ls"" commands could use some brief explanation, because explanations for arguably more obvious things are provided in the lectures, yet these new commands are suddenly used in quick succession and could catch an absolute beginner off guard. At least that's how I remember it. Maybe there was a brief explanation there. If not, it could be accomplished via a pop-up textual comment, which would minimize the need to edit course content."
2020-09-14,Kirill S,5,0,"I want to say that if you are interested in starting programming, but you are not sure what programming language you want to learn first, then you can learn basics of Python in this course. This course was recommended to me by my friend and I am glad that I took my time to complete it and it will surely help me in my future studies. The instructor is very good, his explanations are very clear. I don't think that I have encountered any problems during this course, so I am going to give it 5 stars."
2019-11-23,Dipesh P,5,0,"This course does indeed open doors of python programming for everyone. For beginners, it is outstanding and not only for its content but also for the way its been taught. Dr. Charles Severance made the learning path so much easier and fun to go with. His passion for sharing the knowledge makes him connect effectively with all the new-comers. It almost felt as if I was being personally tutored by him.
I would highly recommend this to beginners who wants to get into python programming from scratch."
2017-05-31,Edward F,5,0,"I took the Python Specialization, which included this course, so I'm going to provide the same review for each of the component courses.
I think this is an excellent course for beginning programmers. Python is a great language for someone starting out - easy to learn - with a lot of power available for more advanced projects (e.g., machine learning).
But, most of all, you have to love Dr. Serverance. I can't think of a more entertaining and enjoyable person to teach programming. Thanks, Dr. Chuck.
"
2021-06-08,Karolina L,5,0,"Words cannot express just now much I appreciate the Instructor and his Team for taking the time and effort to provide such a high-quality, fun and engaging course! This was my first programming course ever and I had many doubts and fears starting out. Thanks to the charisma and extraordinary teaching skills of Dr. Chuck, I managed not only to finish the course, but also learn so much in the process. I highly recommend this course to anyone just starting out in the field of computer programming."
2020-04-18,Ajit P,5,0,"Dear Sir, Thank you for teaching. I think we should include more exercises and peer review for actual programs (like done in second week)
The course overall was satisfactory and I think it gives us students confidence to go ahead and complete next courses. (i really needed to feel comfortable after first course since I have worked in sales, maintenance, application and product management of laboratory instruments for almost 10 years, so I don't really have a typical computer science background )"
2021-10-21,Jordy J H,5,0,"It's a very simple but easy to understand course. Chuck was a very good instructor and it's not hard to get by the basics of Python. So far, nothing wrong with it, and getting the problems solved with was not bad at all. It can get a bit challenging at times, especially in some parts with the loops and other elements but nevertheless, the course was easy to follow, and the instructor does have a lot of interesting passion to show off with Python and how to get used to the programming language."
2018-03-28,Rafael Z,5,0,"I already started with an educational book about python, it made me complete this course rather fast i think but i went over a lot of details which were not really explained in that book.

 I am looking forward to learning more about python through his courses. This is just the type of course that I was wanting to do for some time and I am lucky I found this through Coursera! Thank you Dr. Chuck! "
2020-05-26,Ricky A,5,0,"Learned a lot about programming in Python, the mentor Dr. Severance put the lessons in such a way that they could be understood with ease, and I could design my code with no problems. The occasional humour is cheerful and creates a very natural-atmosphere like any other college class with your favourite teacher. The class also has a very motivational atmosphere too, Dr. Severance really develops a can-do attitude among students. Really considering enrolling in the second course of this series "
2017-01-10,Sagar G,5,0,"This course laid the foundation for me in programing. I have learnt a lot from Dr. Chuck, Mentors and from my peers. Timely assistance from mentors and my peers helped me a lot in learning python. Textbook material plus classnotes provided by Dr.Chuck and his team further helps in learning. If anyone learning this course ,I recommend read textbook and class notes after watching the videos and then start with assignments. I am glad I took this course and highly recommend others to do the same. "
2020-09-15,Vasilis D,5,0,"  This course was way better than I expected. For someone that wasn't a beginner, but hadn't touched programming for almost 5 years it was a nice way to get back in touch with essential concepts even if they were in a slightly different language than the one I knew. Very good structure, even though I believe functions should appear later than iteration, but anyway very good effort, amazing teaching and very detailed tutorials. I enjoyed the quizzes and exercises as well. Keep up the good work!  "
2018-11-17,MURAMATSU,5,0,"Though I run though the book for basic knowledge about how to write python code, I still wondered what meaning each code has and how each code actually work in computer program. This course helped me to understand that point. I will continuously study next modules and want to get able to utilize python for real job. 
And also, I was impressed with system which shows text for teacher's explanation, sophisticated assignment system, and a lot of tips and tools.
Thanks a lot for meaningful course."
2017-07-01,Aron W,5,0,"  I've started three other courses on python and while none of them were bad, this one was the only one that I completed. I have a background in sql programming so syntax and operations weren't brand new, but I had always struggled diving into any more than basic data pulls. I was able to get through this course very quickly and at the end felt very comfortable that I could start solving problems in python. I'm looking forward to the rest of the courses in the Python for Everybody certificate.  "
2016-08-07,Aleksandra,5,0,"A great introduction into fundamental concepts in Python. Dr. Chuck is a perfect teacher, funny, competent and engaging. You will watch the videos in no time! Also, the electronic version of the book is free and covers every problem you can possibly come across in this course. My recommendation: install Python on your computer immediately after enrolling and track the differences between Python 2 (course version) and Python 3. For example, instead of using ""print x"", you will use ""print(x)""."
2021-06-17,Nikki T,5,0,"This is a great beginner course! I came in the course with absolutely no prior knowledge of Python at all and learned basic python from this course. Even through the video, the professor has a great sense of humour and an excellent teaching style. He breaks it down for you and explains mostly everything in detail so you aren't left in the dark. I would probably pay him my 30K tuition if I could go back in time instead of paying that to my University for my BsC which taught me nothing great. "
2019-07-08,Ajayraj S,5,0,"I'm very much thankful of Coursera and University of Michigan to let me opt this wonderful course. I highly recommend this course to each and every person wants to start learning programming. Because as python is best language to begin with, this course is best for begin learning python. Instructor Dr. Chuck ws the best mentor for me, he explains each and everything very nicely that everybody could understand. I'm so glad that I completed this course or had a chance to complete this course."
2018-05-25,Aniruddha C,5,0,"  This has to be one of the best beginner course of Python on the internet! The instructions given by Charles Severance  were clear and concise. The videos never felt boring as each video prompted me to try different things in python to solve the problems shown in them. If given enough dedication and focus, one can complete this course within 2 weeks! I sincerely thank the Instructor, University of Michigan and Coursera for making it possible for foreign students to receive quality education. "
2021-10-10,Jeison D C F,5,0,"This course was really practical and entertained, gives you a lot of learning material, it is dynamic, with a good grading tool that lets you play with it, learn from it, a few basic quizzes, and really good explanation videos. I had a little previous experience programming, so it was natural and effortless, but still has a really good entry level explanations, not just tech you how to write python, it teach you how to think in programming logic, how to create algorithms and how all works."
2020-10-09,AASHISH K,5,0,"  This course is an excellent introduction to the Python programming language. Not only is this an introductory course, but it teaches you almost all the basics that will help you start with simple programming problems with Python. The instructor really understands the way how students should be introduced to new concepts of Python. I loved going through this course and learning Python. With all the practice assignments and quizzes, I felt very comfortable because I understood what I learnt.  "
2020-07-12,Nguyen T A T,5,0,"Before entering this course, I was scared because I failed my python course last semester, because the teacher sucks, so I got insecure about enrolling. But Dr. Chuck inspired me a great deal since the beginning, and his teaching method is really the best I've seen in my life because I came from a developing country where teachers are ... disappointing and it's sad, I don't hate it I just feel sad about it. Overall, amazing course, though only basics, fantastic teacher! Thank you Coursera."
2020-03-31,Harsh V,5,0,"The instructor is very enthusiastic and you will never get bored, teaching is very good, even if you are new to programming you will not stuck in this course. For me I have basic knowledge of python prior to this course and took this course for further courses ahed and to get Certificate, but i would say even I knew everything in this course I was not bored at all but yeah I skipped some parts in it. Overall I would say go for it, it's a good course for python and explanation is very good. "
2020-02-21,Omkar D H,5,0,"
Very helpful,

Learned all the fundamentals of python programming.

totally satisfied with the course content and it also helped me extremely by clearing all my doubts, as well as course got a clear perspective,
to how to use python is a practical point of view.
Also got historical knowledge about the evolution of python and about it's creators.
thank you to prof. Severance


for everything
He is an great teacher and understands the way of delivering the knowledge to the beginners.
Keep it up. 
        

"
2017-03-03,Dirk C,5,0,"I loved every minute, thank you. 
For me the fact that I could download the videos, watch them without Internet connectivity, complete the Quizzes and assignments on-line made this course stand out above others.
The content started from knowing nothing to more advanced at a slow pace in order for all to follow, this is great.  
Paying monthly $49 made the specialization course affordable for me living in South Africa.
I thank you for the a great course, looking forward in completing the rest. "
2018-11-12,RH,5,0,"Very nicely designed starter for Python learners! I'm in finance and only got little programming background in Matlab and VBA, and this course helps me to know the basic structure of this programming language. Professor Chuck not only knows programming, but also knows how to teach the methodologies clearly to ordinary people. This Getting Started with Python gives me the confidence to deal with the future Python questions and I will continue with the next courses. Thank you, Dr. Chuck!"
2018-05-31,Ella W,5,0,"Honestly, this course is great for beginners. The instruction is explicit and clear and very structured. The textbook is very useful to understand the basics of programming language. I also like the assessment combining quizzes and hands-on exercise to get familiar with the coding process. Plus, the bonus part enhanced the connected learning and informal learning practice, and also increases the instructor presence. The pace is just right and the workload is perfect. Love this course!! "
2018-02-11,Eleanor S,5,0,"What a fantastic course! Every element is explained from the perspective of the way python processes the code, so you get a solid set of 'first principles' to work with. 
The videos use excellent simple examples, which are then extended as the topics become more complex, so you get the sense of really building from the ground up.  Chuck Severance is clearly a pedagogical master. How lucky we are to have access to his teaching from all over the world (Australia specifically, in my case)! 
"
2017-01-11,Mike F,5,0,"This is a fantastic course that takes people from a whole spectrum of experience, at their own pace, from introduction to computing and programming through to writing basic Python programmes.  I believe that I could work with my 9 year old daughter to get through this course.  If you have never programmed before, you will be amazed by what you will achieve on this course through the lectures, self study reading and community support.  YOU CAN DO IT!!  I'm enrolling for the next module!"
2021-06-27,sharon h,5,0,I am an adult learner in my 50s. Computers started to come into mainstream when I was in hight school. I took this class through another university online and it was horrible. I really appreciated Dr. Chuck's teaching style and presentations. The use of the flow charts really clarified what/how the program processed the data input/output. I never thought I would be able to understand programming. But now my teenagers are asking me for help. Thank you so much for putting this together.
2020-07-05,Apoorvah,5,0,"As a consequence of lockdown, I wanted to learn the basics of coding and programming. 
This is an amazing course, I understood everything from scratch and genuinely enjoyed doing it. 
Not only that, but I can also practically apply this knowledge in financial analysis. I have a long way to go as a programmer but I surely love what I studied and can apply it to my work as well. The teaching style of the professor is also commendable. It seems personal even though these are video lectures"
2020-05-09,WANG X,5,0,"I love this course very much. Before I started this course, I thought Python was difficult to learn because I knew nothing about programming, but the teacher made it easy and interesting to understand. I am thankful for Professor Charles for his contribution to the course. This course totally inspires me and makes me want to explore more on python and programming. It's so awesome. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is a beginner of Python or programming to learn this course."
2021-04-29,Ayushi K,5,0,"Course was easy to understand, engaging and interesting . I really liked the way of teaching.

I really enjoyed learning through this course ang got to know many knew things. 

This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience 

working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what 

questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen and He was interesting and even funny at times."
2020-04-16,Andres F G M,5,0,"Getting started with Python is a friendly and well-structured way to start learning python language. I think this course is very helpful for people that have no notions in python or even in programming language. Maybe, I could give a biased review knowing my knowledge in computer programming since few years ago, But, still it was very good to refresh concepts and start learn another language. In addition, Pf. Severance  has a really good pedagogy to give virtual courses. Recommended!"
2020-10-18,Jean-Pierre F,5,0,"That is a very nice and well structured course. It's very clear and simplified. I really liked it. I just have one point to clarify and it's that I couldn't see the goal of what I was learning, but once I began the second course and especially the 7th chapter I noticed that I can't be done otherwise and that is the basics we need to do useful exercises and tasks like the ones we are doing now.

Thank you very much Dr. Charles Russell and much appreciation to the University of Michigan"
2020-05-24,Micheal A S,5,0,"This course was nothing short of phenomenal. If you have not been in a classroom setting for a while, or if you have never committed to online education before, don't worry! This is absolutely the class for you if you are considering embarking on your journey of learning how to code Python. Good luck to all that attend this class. I would also like to thank the University of Michigan and Dr. Charles Russell Severance for an amazing experience and a quality education from this class."
2020-05-09,MD H H A,5,0,"
This is the first course I have taken in Coursera and I want to say only
 one thing about this course that ""You don't have to know any 
programming language and you don't require any kinda skills to start 
this course even though you don't require any kinda knowledge in terms 
of this sector. You can start from zero levels which are going to lead 
you a not the infinity level but a level where you can know python, 
where you can be a programmer on python "" SO just enroll the course.


"
2021-11-27,Anthony R,5,0,"This course was great and I'm usually very critical of Coursera courses! I finished the class in 3 days with no prior python experience; however, understanding that it's better to take the foundational steps slow, I went back and read a different python textbook for a couple days and then rewatched this whole course at 1.25x speed and redid all of the assignments. Programming has been fun and it's exciting to solve these problems on our own. Looking forward to the challenges ahead!"
2020-05-11,SHITAL P,5,0,"Dr Chuck is amazing. I loved his teaching style. Before this also I tried programming but learning was never so easy and interesting. The course content is awesome. I am from mechanical background, did not have any programming background but still i never felt any difficulty while during assignments or understanding the lecture. The syllabus, Quiz and assignments are planned very well. Thank you Coursera and Dr Chuck. I would like to continue learning python with coursera/Dr.Chuck."
2022-08-22,David C,5,0,"The information was presented in a way that made it easily understandable. I was able to complete all assignments with just the right amount of difficulty. It wasn't so easy as to be pointless, but not so difficult that I was unable to progress without getting help or giving up. Each assignment seemed to build off of the previous ones in a way that reaffirmed what I had already been taught, which is something I enjoy when learning processes that eventually become very complicated."
2021-01-17,Brittany B,5,0,Before this course python was just another language I did not know.  Now I know the very basis concepts and how to use them.  I can right simple code and run it .  The best thing is you do not need to be a math wiz or a computer nerd to get this course.  I did watch most videos more then once as I am a slow learning but in less then a month finished with flying colors and can't wait to start the next course. If you know python or the basics of python this is not the course of you. 
2021-01-12,LALIT B,5,0,"I am a student of computer science engineering and i needed to learn the Python programming language as the colleges were closed due to covid-19. It was a great opportunity for me to level up my skills.
The instructor was very friendly and fun and he taught the things in very simplified manner and the course also provided good material for studying. The course also included the interview series to get motivated. Overall the course was very good and is recommended for the beginners. "
2020-06-10,Nitin A,5,0,"  This course helps a non programmer understand the basic ideas of programming using python. It is extremely easy and is probably the first step for anyone into programming. Apart from explaining the concepts in an easy to understand manner, the exercises also help confirm that understanding with an auto-grade feature. The course also has some really interesting Bonus chapters which gives you a background on how it all started as well as interviewing some really interesting techies!  "
2016-02-07,Jeff N,5,0,"
Outstanding Course for a newby. All about programming. Lectures and problems are clear and relate directly to the subject not related topics like statistics and other disciplines which add nothing to the Python and Python programming focus. Dr. Severance has built a great specialization here. Problems can be challenging but doable within the time frame represented by the course description (give or take a couple hours on some of the more challenging ones. I've learned alot! Thanks"
2020-07-21,Jeryl Y S,5,0,"4.5/5.0. Thank you for this! Charles is a great instructor, the explanations were great. I took another python introductory course prior to this and this really built on that foundation. Recommend this to anyone who wants to start their path into python. I'm personally taking the Python specialisation from UoM and I'm so excited to begin on the 2nd course! Would have given a full 5/5 if the course materials were provided to be downloaded so we could reference it whenever we want. "
2020-04-25,Paul S,5,0,"Great course, got me excited about learning more. The instructor, Dr. Severance, is easy to follow, entertaining, and has a knack for explaining concepts simply.  It can seem to be going a little slow but I think that's intentional to force the student to really absorb the concepts. More assignments would be helpful and some multi-unit assignments that help the student put several concepts together would be great. This feels like a topic that you only really get through practice."
2019-03-31,Barrie C,5,0,"Excellent engaged and engaging instructor!  Dr. Chuck is entertaining and informative at the same time, highly recommend.  I've learned so much already--I had some prior programming experience so watched ""Getting started"" on 1.5x speed but still learned things I didn't know.  He really starts from the beginning and fills in any gaps you may not realize you have even if you've already coded before, and gives a great foundation to anyone who doesn't have previous coding experience."
2018-01-30,黄昱森,5,0,"very interesting course by Dr.Chuck. It took me a week to master the basic of Python as I have experience in Java and C++. Still, I recommend this course to those who are new to computer programming. The course explains the core of computer programming language clearly and class assignments are all well designed. I especially enjoy the video of Dr.Chuck talking with all those successful developer in computer science industry. What they share in the video is genuine and inspiring."
2017-10-20,Amanda K,5,0,"Fantastic course!  Dr Chuck is great at explaining things simply and efficiently. His examples and way of seeing programming and computers really helped me to understand concepts.  The exercises build on the lessons but don't always mirror them, which is a great way to learn.  I found it easy at first, then by the last lesson slightly difficult - this is my first programming language and I am a complete neophyte. I really appreciated this course and look forward to the next one!    "
2020-08-25,Emily M,5,0,Fantastic course. I took 6.001 (Intro to Computer Science) at MIT 25 years ago and haven't done much programming since then. I want to help my kids learn some programming and thought Python would be a good start. I tried a few different courses and then got to this one which is perfect. Dr. Chuck explains everything so well and he's very enjoyable to watch with just the right mix of humor. The quizzes and assignments are well-designed to help ensure you understand the material.  
2016-05-07,Natawan P,5,0,"I have tried a few basic programming courses before, but failed to go beyond the first lecture. I found them difficult to comprehend and felt discouraged to learn programming. But then, I came across this course and it got me excited to learn programming again. From the first lecture to the last, the instructor covers different important concepts in the way that anyone can understand. The book is also easy to read. I strongly recommend programming newbies to check this one out."
2020-05-27,Avani K V,5,0,"The teaching pedagogy of Prof. Charles is awesome. He made his class so interactive via his delivery and communication skills, on an online platform was very impressive and very helpful, to carry on. Course content was equally good and Professor made us learn that very well. After attending this I am really interested to apply some course to be taught in Michigan under Prof. Charles, himself in near future. It was a great experience with lots of new learning.
 Thanks a lot Sir.  "
2020-05-16,Kalpana H,5,0,"Greetings to All Professors!!!!
It was really very useful for me. Prof. I am really thankful , because it was my first hand try in programming. I used to think like I will never understand the language of programming  ever. but the way u explained (in a very easy and crisp form )was amazing. Hope u to contribute more good work in future.
 Wishing you and your family  a  happy and health life ahead.......

2021-08-06,JENNIVER A,5,0,I learned a lot and I love Python as a language. Dr. Charles is reliable instructor. He teach the course with lot of fun though the course is tough for me as a beginner. I really thank Coursera too for giving me an opportunity to study the course under financial aide. This course boost my confidence and gives me more knowledge about how programming works and it help me understand and perform in my job far way better. Thank you so much Coursera and Dr. Charles I owe you a lot.
2018-01-06,gary g,5,0,"Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python). This is the first programming course I have done where right from the beginning I have been getting those feelings of ""I get it"". Normally I am thinking you do not necessarily have to understand all this, just remember it. I hope I can remember all this syntax. Obviously the equanimity and ken of the distinguished teacher has a lot to do with the level of . understanding. So thank you sir, I highly recommend this course  "
2020-07-20,Fanshi L,5,0,"The course provides a very general and complete background knowledge of python, starting with the very basics that everyone, after some practice, can understand. More interestingly, there is a sequence of videos showing you how different tech start-ups came into being, including the python languages itself. Moreover, these videos are interviews of Dr. Severance (course lecturer) and founders of these start-ups, including the father of python of course. So that's pretty cool."
2016-01-24,Shai S,5,0,"I joined this course to start learning Python. Although I know how to write code in other script languages (Not a full time programmer) I decided to start from the beginning so I won't miss syntax differences.
I'm really glad I did take this course because although the main subjects were familiar to me I learned a lot about how to approach Python and some of the syntax differences it has compared to other languages I know.
I'm now going to start the next course in this series!"
2021-06-24,Seba E,5,0,"El curso es muy bueno, esta muy bien explicado con un gran profesor que tiene experiencia en el area y es muy didáctico, tiene todo el materia muy bien organizado en videos, material de referencia y explicaciones a los ejercicios. Puedo confirmar que es un curso apto para principiantes ya que antes de este curso no tenia ningun tipo de experiencia ni conocimiento en el ambito de la programacion. Lo recomiendo para todos los que quieran empezar a programar o aprender Python."
2020-02-15,David M,5,0,"Excellent introductory course to programming using Python. Basic programming constructs like control flow, definite/indefinite loops and exception handling are covered. The instructor does a good job of highlighting some common errors which beginning programmers may make. The course also includes some general info on how computers work. 
Note that this is very much a beginner's course (as stated); somebody with any programming background will find this course highly trivial."
2018-01-17,Andrew S,5,0,"It was a good initial course to review overall functions of python, I would have preferred a much more full time visual based course. Watching lectures might be helpful for some and they are in college, those of us whose learning is hindered by lecture and instead we love watching the teacher type as he teaches those are higher quality interactions for me mentally.
Thank you professor for having lots of well edited videos and hand stylus lectures.
This is very helpful for me."
2017-02-14,Bob W S B,5,0,"Thank you Dr Chunk, it's a definite course for Everybody.  Your ability to put complex knowledge in easy to understand manner is simply amazing.  Learned a great deal from you. Complete all the first 3 parts, except not able to submit the quizzes and now half-way through the 4th: Using Databases with Python.
I have even get my teenage boy to enroll into this course and highly recommend it to my girl who is in the uni.
Thank you once again, greatly appreciated!

2015-10-30,Ezequiel K,5,0,"A great course to get started with programming in general and with Python in particular.
As stated in the abstract, this course is addressed to those who have no experience in programming. However, even if you have some experience but are not familiar with Python (as it was my case), you can take this course quickly (speed x1.50) in order to learn the basic sintax of Python and catch up for the following courses in the specialization.
Really clear teacher. Highly recommended! "
2016-07-24,Christopher R,5,0,"I started taking a for-credit online course on Python through the UC Berkeley Extension, but found both that it didn't explain the basics, and that the actual content was sparse. I was very grateful to find this specialization, with the wonderful Charles Severance as the instructor! He's a very clear teacher, and charming besides.
I loved course #1 of the specialization, and look forward to course #2, which lines up with the UC Berkeley course. Let's learn Python, shall we?"
2020-06-24,Yuthika D,5,0,"It was a great experience for me learning this course as it was neither too easy nor too hard to understand the basics of python for someone first learning about the language. And thanks a lot to Dr. Chuck whose lecture was just too awesome to ignore. He made me (a biology student) love the subject which I only dreamed about in my imaginary world. Thank you so much Coursera, University of Michigan and last but not the least Dr. Charles R. Severance for making it possible.

2020-06-09,Rafael D,5,0,"Incredible course. The platform was amazing and the format as well. Special thanks to the slitherin teacher, he has a special gift to teach. I had a great time and learned everything in less than a week, thanks to the amazing teaching techniques applied. Best regards from Argentina in COVID-19 times. I am a Mathematics student from the Uniersidad de Buenos Aires and this is my first time programming, found a new passion partly thanks to you guys, I'll be grateful forever."

The course was very interesting and enjoyed so much that I sat down for the course  continuously for 6 hours daily. I look forward to participate in more such courses or a degree course, if given an opportunity with financial help as given for this course. I wish to remain a part of Coursera. 
Once again thank you very much to the entire team of Coursera and Professors.

2020-11-29,Ishwar P,5,0,"  This is a great introduction to Python. Before taking up this course I thought that python would be a difficult language to learn as it is applicable in every technological field. Prior to this class, I had zero Python experience and now after this course I am really very confident about the python basics.I would like thanks Professor Severance for making this course simple to understand.Professor Severance is a great teacher – I wish I could have had him as a professor.

2018-06-12,Jian Z,5,0,"This course provides a basic introduction to the Python language and its usage. Besides that all course materials are online and easily accessible, I very much appreciate the instructor's enthusiasm about the field and clarity about the application of this language. Last, it is indeed a great idea to have interviews with many interesting figures in the Data science and Python community. Glad to know that this course has a global network through the office hours as well!"
2016-11-12,Gowtham B,5,0,"Helps in understanding the basic concepts of programming with the help of more general beginner specific programming language python. Gives a deeper insight about how the functionality of logical and mathematical statements interpretation by a machine and expands out thinking about various control structures. Increases ones interest in programming and developing self skills like self thinking, optimizing and testing of different working models in a programming language."
2016-04-21,Ced W,5,0,"Dr. Severance is great. He introduces you to coding in a way that is non-intimidating and feels completely natural within a couple of weeks. Instead of dreading class I found myself excited about attending everyday and was able to progress faster than the course outline due to his extremely clear and supportive teaching method. I'm already reading data from files and it isn't even covered until the next course. If you take this class, read the book and you will do well."
2020-04-21,Dara F,5,0,"Charles Severance is the first teacher to slow down enough that I understood each and every element introduced. It's so much more appreciated at these beginning, easy levels rather than for complex ideas. When starting on a totally new way of thinking, it really helps to have 'obvious' things explained in full. Not everyone will need to slow down as much, but if you're just starting out, it can't hurt! 
Looking forward to more complicated ideas approached the same way!"
2017-08-07,Christopher M,5,0,"Programming is made truly accessible for everyone in this course! I'm not a computer scientist by formal education, so I was a bit hesitant about taking a foreign language (Python). To my delight, the videos are engaging and make you want to progress further into the material. I want to write scripts and am proud to say that I can run Python from my command prompt :D! Thank you Coursera; Thank you University of Michigan; and last but certainly not least -- Thank you D"
2020-09-30,Brett C,5,0,"This was an excellent course for teaching me the basics of python at a comfortable pace that was digestible enough for me to come away with just the right amount of key takeaways from each lesson.
The assignments also presented just enough of a challenge each time to really hammer in my understanding of the previous lesson, without making me feel overwhelmed and lost.
I think most importantly, this course has me eager to keep learning! I can't wait to jump into Part 2!"
2018-10-27,Frank A,5,0,"At 46, learning programming has been difficult and often find myself discouraged (grumpy).  I've bought books and considered gambling thousands of dollars on local courses.  I'm so glad I went with Coursera. I chose this course after watching a video.  Wow, Thank you to Charles Severance and the University of Michigan for an truly amazing, and well put together program. I've been at this for a few years and I'm finally making progress thanks to this course.  Amazing.  "
2022-03-13,Arsh H,5,0,"Dr Chuck taught this course from scratch, first two weeks I thought I am not learning new  but eventually realised that Chuck was building foundations for the upcoming weeks. I loved the way he was teaching and watching a legendary figure at the end of each was something kinda motivation to keep going, office hours reminded me of 1000s of students just like me. I will continue with course 2 of Python with everybody. Thanks, Dr Charles . one day maybe I'll meet you !"
2021-08-06,Abdelillah L,5,0,"Amazing content, well paced and definitely worth your time considering what's to learn in the learning path. 
Charles is a great tutor. Very engaging. I very much loved the Harry Potter touch in the beginning. Certainly did help bringing some ""play"" into all the ensuing work. It was so engaging that I kept coming back and waiting for other references (to my own displeasure, there were none. I have been tricked by Severus, typical). 
Great content, THANK YOU A BUNCH!"
2018-05-27,Sun W,5,0,"The very first course is well organized so that you won't have much problems if you follow the instructions strictly  and can learn well and thus form a solid foundation about Python. 
Besides, Dr. Chuck is very humorous and teaches well. What's more, he gives students like me who has none program experience before a lot of encouragement which is very vital for us to build confidence in learning program. I guess it is my favorite point about this introductory course. "
2018-10-20,jesse s,5,0,"I audit this course. As I am a student studying computer science already, this course is too easy for me.
Mr.Charles shows a great understanding of the programming and he exactly knows how to lead a new learner to understand the concept of programming.
Step by step, I still got a lot of things learned.
I definitely would support this course but I am in lack of money because I am just a poor student.
In short, this is a very nice course for new guys step to programming."
2018-02-01,Denise F,5,0,"Great course for beginners, well structured and really well presented by Charles Severance! I loved how he presented the logics of programming in python, pretty straight forward and applied (not wandering much around stuff you don't need to understand if your aim is just to get started). Great job and thanks a lot, Charles! I'll surely recommend it to friends, also thinking about helping out with translation to Portuguese. Worthy the time, don't wait to take it. ;) "
2016-01-23,Kartik J,5,0,"
I really had good time learning this course. And this course instructor Charles Severance gave amazing details and intro towards programming, many lecturers just go with direct definitions and concepts present in some textbook but don't go with simplicity. Many new students need something that is simple and clear so I think sir Charles is best in doing that and hes my favourite lecturer now. If the courses are this fun and interesting I wouldn't mind paying for it."
2022-05-08,Alessandro G,5,0,"Sorry if i make any mistakes but i'm using google translate.

The course is really well done, the professor explains really well and in a fun way all the concepts that are covered, the quizzes and exercises are very useful and fun to do, especially the exercises, which really test what you have learned during lessons.
During the course apart from some problems with the subtitles (Italian) that changed the meaning of some words (just a few terms) I had no problems."
2020-03-12,Xinnan W,5,0,"I really enjoy the design of Coursera and appreciate the materials provided by University of Michigan. This is the beginning of Python, but it motivates me to want to learn more about this skill. Video lectures are easy to follow up--they come with subtitle of different languages. The third party python tool is quite useful for you to do exercise and get insight of how to get familiar with this intelligent programming tool. I'm looking forward to keep studying it!"
2017-12-18,姜媛溪,5,0,"I highly recommend this course for those people who has basically no coding experience. I took some programming course like financial computation using MATLAB in college, but I did learn it well and that was not a happy experience. But this course, you can learn everything about python from a very beginning level. If you watch the lecture video carefully, you can finish the assignment easily. In the meanwhile, you start your very first step to become a programmer."
2020-08-27,Григорьев С Н,5,0,"Хороший курс, чтобы начать знакомство с ""питоном"". Харизматичный преподаватель подают информацию в достаточно доступной форме, не обременяя лишней информацией. В д/з имеются, как онлайн тесты, так и решение задач по программированию. Задач могло бы быть и побольше, но для САМОГО начал этого вполне достаточно. К относительному недостатку можно отнести язык курса: требуется знание английского на среднем уровне, т.к. русские субтитры имеются не во всех видеороликах."
2020-06-18,Karthik C,5,0,"This course has helped in learing the subject that i was interested with ease and 
Dr. Chuk's way of approaching and interacting with students is really great.

And still more courses  to learn from this platform in less time..!"
2017-11-11,Christopher T,5,0,"This was an excellent course. It's easy to understand and all the tools are provided by Dr. Chuck and his excellent staff of TAs and mentors. I like Dr. Chuck's style of teaching, and his belief that everyone should learn to code in a computer language in our modern world is a worthy goal. I highly recommend this course both to experienced programmers who want to learn Python and to novices who want to learn programming (though it's better suited for the latter)."
2020-07-23,Libin P,5,0,Thank you sir i am first time i had done any course online and this was a wonderful experience  .Very good introduction to basic programming. Very easy for beginners in python who have already some programming background - but still extremely useful to quickly and efficiently learn python basics.

2020-02-28,Olivier H,5,0,"I wrote zillions of lines of Fortran 30 years ago, did a bit of C++ 20 years ago just to understand what object programming was, and... that's it. So at the same time it was very basic for an experienced programmer but excellent pedagogy and ideal to get your environment installed and have a hand on the basic syntax. Some of the ways notions are introduced are excellent and I would have loved to have a similar course on Fortran when I started. Congratulations... "
2017-02-26,Jayid A,5,0,"One of the best programming courses to get started. Python should be the #1 choice for anyone who's willing to kick start their journey to programming. Plus, Dr. Chuck is an amazing instructor. He takes his time to explain the material well. The lectures are easy to follow but the assignments might seem a bit challenging some times. However, the assignments are not impossible and if you try you'll definitely will be able to do it. I highly recommend this course.

I have always looked forward to the next tutorial every time, and now i can't begin to start the next course under this specialization. In case if anybody is looking to learn Python, this is definitely the course/specialization to take.  "
2020-06-27,Kit F,5,0,"This was a great course!  I don't know where else you can learn to program; seemingly other programming courses assume that you already know another programming language.  This course takes you from knowing nothing to knowing the basics and prepares you for learning more about Python.  
It was an enjoyable experience, Prof Severance is very relaxed and uses ordinary language. 
I bought his book, which I believe can also  be downloaded for free, which was helpful."

2018-09-02,Brett S,5,0,"I was encouraged to take this course as an introduction to the world of programming. I am a novice programmer who has no formal training. This course was both fun and engaging. While challenging at times, generally any feedback I needed had already been discussed on the discussion boards. A simple search for the error you encounter should help you to independently debug your script and develop the flow of execution described in the prompt for each assignment."

However, after taking this course, I was amazed at what gaps of knowledge I was missing and learned something new. I highly recommend this course; not only does it teach you python, but it also makes you see a different perspective on how to tackle problems through python while having fun. Cheers to Prof. Charles Russell Severance for being a fantastic teacher! "
2021-08-07,Nikhil V J,5,0, Dr. Charles Severance is a superb faculty who taught this course. He has created a friendly atmosphere while learning the course and I learned some basics with great examples given by him. Python is going to my first programming language which I am going to learn and I think this journey of learning python with Dr. Chuck is going to be really awesome. And I really loved the bonus sessions which is something out of the box. Thank MIT for building this course.   
2021-01-11,Владимир Р,5,0,"Большего и лучшего я не ожидал - Питон преподносится так просто и легко, при этом объясняется как работает любой код и язык - как компьютер его расценивает, и что при этом происходит. Рекомендую однозначно всем, кто хочет разобраться в Python. Ничего лучшего я не встречал!!! Огромная благодарность Мичиганскому университету и лично доктору Чарльзу Северину. Этот профессор Снейп просто влюбляет в змеиный язык, при этом реально - моя жизнь меняется к лучшему..."
2020-08-04,Mayank J,5,0,"The very first thing that i must say is that the professor Charles is exceptionally well..i could not understand the programming concepts with so much ease before this..the teaching style is great and the slides give every key information about what is being taught so you can capture screenshots and make notes with help of it..and the assignments help you to practice what you've learned...so overall a great course!
Thank you Coursera.
Thanku Professor Charles."
2020-03-18,Navneet K,5,0,"Full marks to the instructor Dr. Chuck. The course was very well designed and the way Dr. chuck communicated and gave examples, it all made great logic and instilled confidence in me. Not to forget, I have been a very bad programmer since school and did not have much knowledge and confidence before this course. But now I feel much comfortable in learning further and other programming languages as well. Thank you so much Coursera and Dr. Chuck for the course.

"
2020-07-07,Yusra W,5,0,"A good introduction to programming
with Python. The instructor Dr. Chuck has a special ability to teach programming
to people who do not have a programming background. This course is a very great
start-up for beginners. Everything is broken down into parts making it easy to
understand. Whoever had no programming experience this course help him/her to
understand this language. 
Thank you, Sir Charles, for making this python course
interesting and informative.
 "
2020-06-25,Uma M ,5,0,"This course is pretty awesome! Chuck sir's explanation is super cool, anybody can master this course ,if anybody teach's like Chuck sir. And this is my first ever online course . I've loved the course each and every topic is explained so clearly and i have done programming without any hesitation like ""my code is not going to work"". I am super excited to look forward for the continuation of this specialization and many other courses too. Thank you coursera ! "
2018-12-28,Anastassios K,5,0,"The way professor Severance teaches and transits the subject is exceptional and makes the course too easy for anyone who wants to learn.
The course itself, for a complete naive like me, had very good pace and at the end I found it very easy.
By reading the accompanied book you have more details and it’s essential to read it also and solve the exercises and not just see the videos in Coursera.
It was a very good first step for me in the Python language. Thanks!"
2019-10-06,Dhruv G,5,0,"  This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to, unlike some moocs I have taken where the teachers were reading and got the intonation all wrong--very distracting. This one wasn't like that by far. He was interesting and even funny at times.  "
2019-09-19,Omatsola C D I,5,0,"During the first assignment, I was taken aback by being given something to solve that was a bit more advanced than what had been learned up to that point, but this was great, because it gave me time to try a couple of things, to see what works, and what doesn't. Felt a bit sad when I struggled, but when I finally succeeded I felt great, and confident in solving related problems. It is really great to learn by making mistakes and trying to figure stuff out."
2018-03-31,David A M,5,0,"This class was very well done. I really enjoyed Dr. Chuck's explanations and the way the class flowed. I do wish it covered a bit more at a slightly accelerated rate.  However, this may be because I'm used to the usual college class intensity.  With that said, I don't have any complaints. I feel like I learned a lot of useful information . I believe this class has laid a good foundation for what is to come.  I would strongly recommend this class to others."
2017-10-08,Aditya K,5,0,"This course offers a good exposure to the fundamentals of Python for the non-programmers.

The instructor is engaging and delivers the material in a crisp manner. 
The only part of the course that can be improved is the length of lectures.
Many lectures are longer than 6 mins  and most cross the 10 min barrier. They can be broken down into smaller lectures , but the engaging presentation by the instructor ensures that no boredom seeps in at any point in time."
2021-04-15,Vaibhav D,5,0,"  What I have learned and understood in this program is basics and logic behind the python code. This was a seven week program evenly distributed where in the first week professor Charles Russell Severance made us understood every tiny aspect of python. which made it very easy to understand what is variable , what is a function , what is a loop. Thank you Coursera and Charles Russell Severance Sir for making us understand the every basic concept of python.  "
2016-01-10,Brandon B,5,0,"Great course for new and experienced programmers alike looking to add Python to their toolbelt. If you're a self-taught programmer, the course can provides you with some basic vocabulary about programming idioms that you may not have had the words for previously. The professor was also quite charming, frequently using humour to lighten the subject matter. I do recommend this course for people that are either new to programming or programming with Python."
2021-02-10,Muhammad S N,5,0,Excellent online beginners level course on Python! Even if you don't have any prior programming experience this course would make it very easy for you to not only learn but also motivates to explore more about the subject. The instructor Dr. Charles Severance teaching style is very engaging and have strong grip on subject and know how to taught someone about programing and making it easy for everyone.  Bonus material provided with the course is awesome. 
2021-01-04,ALESSANDRO S,5,0,"I have very enjoyed this course and I have very appreciated the method of teaching of the Instructor, that is very expertise in the Python programming and he is very clear in the explaining of the several arguments.   

I am a beginner in the programming but the course is well organized and allows to everyone to know the basic notion of the Python language.

I am sure to continue the learning on the Python language with the other courses that are offered."
2020-05-22,Suraj M,5,0,"Hi this is Suraj,
It was a great experience learning python. I really loved the way the quiz were designed and also the course went on smoothly. Not everything was told in the video so I had to google things out to complete the assignments. Like how do I print all numbers in one single line while using a loop, and also how do I print something without giving a space. These basic things I feel were left on purpose to push the student to explore and learn."
2018-01-01,Jose I J,5,0,"Great course! I had 11 years with no programming activities, I was a developer for Delphy & PowerBuilder 11 years back but Python seems to be quite interesting to learn out. This course is great for people that have little experience on programming languages, but it was great for me as 11 years is a lot time, now I want to learn web / digital programming languages and I'll continue studying other Python courses in coursera for sure!!!!. Thanks a million"
2021-03-26,Kevin L,5,0,"Well, I have to admit that the fact that this course has Chinese subtitles is one of the reasons why I gave it the highest score, and to be honest, I'm quite eager to take a first-hand course in the US.

I will continue to participate in coursera courses because I can't wait to get any marketable skills from coursera, thanks to Prof. Charles Severance of the University of Michigan and the coursera team, because the world will be a better place with you!"
2020-10-20,Joanne P D,5,0,"Short but a very suitable Introduction for those who have no prior knowledge in Python. The instructor is excellent at explaining everything. The slides are creative. I like how the colors match the code and their corresponding definitions. The exercises are also fun to do. Honestly, there is no pressure of memorizing stuff, I could just simply look through my notes and play with the details something that is not typically done in a university setting."
2020-09-26,Aurimas N,5,0,"I've had some prior experience with Python 2 before yet this course was far from boring and reminded of some functions which I have never internalised before such as try/except or continue or break the loop. Dr Chuck has been fun to watch yet they managed to achieve outstanding clarity above all. Lastly, the additional resources like the interviews with Guido van Rossum were extremely interesting and making me want to learn Python even more. Thank you!"
2020-05-15,Romit T,5,0,"This course is really awesome! Hands down to Dr. Chuck for his way of teaching. The best Python course you could find anywhere. And I come from the background where I have spent a lot of time searching for a good course for getting my Python basics cleared. This course has helped me get them clear.
Starting the next courses in the Py4e specialization right away!
Big thanks to Coursera and the University of Michigan for providing such a wonderful course!!"
2016-03-25,Sundari E,5,0,"Dear Chuck,
Can I call you Chuck? Anyway Sir, you are AWESOME!! If I become a programmer in my life, you'll be the only reason for it. You simply are great. I wish I had more teachers like you. I also wish I could meet you and tell you in person, that you are the personification of pure awesomness. 
Thank you soooooo much
Yours truly,
A student who absolutely loves you and is eternally grateful to you from the other part of the world :)
Keep being awesome!!"
2020-04-20,Jerin P J,5,0,This  is the perfect course for anyone who wants to learn python.

I truly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn python.Thank you Coursera and special thanks to the instructor
2017-01-16,Sebastian C,5,0,"
This is a great course for those with no programming experience, especially since it involves python. I recommend to anyone with no experience that they start with python because the syntax is easy to learn and it is as close to psuedo-code used to develop algorithms as it comes. Although I have years of experience with python in my undergraduate and graduate research, I respect the teaching quality and attention to detail used throughout this course.  "
2021-04-28,K S,5,0,Charles Severance was a great mentor who teaches python from its very basic level. His method of teaching is excellent and provided me the foundation of Python. The assignments and graded tool evaluation was a bit tricky to crack yet helped in strengthening my python knowledge. It is a privilege to study a course in Michigan under a strong mentor like Sir Charles.I would recommend this course to anyone who is seeking the basic knowledge about Python.
2020-09-14,Harsh V,5,0,"Is very good course for those who is start programming by choosing python as their first language and it might be a little boring for those guys who has a good programming knowledge but I think it is the best course which I have completed online and it is best because they have provided a lots of pre-prepared contents like PPTs, book, programs,.etc. which might be very good for people like me- who make notes or who like to go through lots of content."
2020-06-20,Aakanksha R,5,0,"This course is the best way to start your programming journey. It not only provides you a systematic and an easy way to understand the Python programming language, all thanks to Professor Charles Severance's interactive and friendly approach which not benefits specially the beginner level programmers but also helps you retain the knowledge with the help of practically performing the assignments and answering quizzes.  This course is truly motivating!"
2016-11-21,Ed D,5,0,"This has been one of the best educational experience I have had and I have had some, Ph.D., MBA.   The best part about this course is that it is impeccably organized and possess timely help to students in need of assistance.  This course should be used as the “gold standard” for teaching, whether online or in the classroom.  I send my congratulations to all that have been and are now involved with overseeing the success of this wonderful achievement.

2015-12-23,Andres M,5,0,"It is the first course I have successfully completed on Coursera. I had a vague background in programming from my undergraduate studies in Engineering, but I have always wanted to learn more. I have found this Course to be the right place so far. I think it’s oriented to anybody who wants to learn to program in general with no specific background and that definitely has been ideal for me. I am continuing with the next course, let’s see how it goes..."
2022-02-11,GANDAMALLA A K H,5,0,This is  very basic course but thoroughly explained which is useful for all kinds of people irrespective of their age and this course serves as a  good touch for people who fear to learn programming or some other reasons.I grasped the contents and assignments serves as a good value to this basic python introduction.Thank you so much Coursera for the opportunity provided and thanks be to Dr.Charles Severance for his elaborate explanation of concepts.
2021-08-07,Arunim B,5,0,"Learning Python Programming Language from Coursera was the perfect decision for me. I had now developed a thorough understanding of Python programming. Thanks to the Professor for teaching me this course. The concepts was very much cleared and he has explained all the basic topics like syntax, loops, conditional statements etc, wonderfully. That's why I will recommend all my batchmates or my juniors to learn any topic from Coursera.
Thankyou Coursera"

2020-06-07,Ashley S,5,0,"I found the instructor to be very informative, having no background in coding myself he made it easy and fun to learn the topics for the course. The only frustrating thing about the class was that the auto grader for assignments would not always recognize when requirements for an assignment had been met. So, even though the code was correct and I got the desired output I would sometimes have to try it in a multitude of ways to get my grade to store."
2018-01-16,Natalia I,5,0,"Great book, fun course. I mainly read chapters of a book instead of watching videos, then did tests and exercises. However, slides were very useful for refreshing before starting a new chapter or just to have a look at key points summarized. I am very thankful to the authors, who made learning my first programming language non-frustrating. I really got addicted to it. I admire the comparison of Python to a dog who doesn't understand what you want fr "
2017-05-01,Michael H,5,0,"Amazing intro to programming class.  I'm consulting with a tech startup and wanted to have better conversations with my developers.  This is a great class to learn the ""theory"" of programming.  I started taking an HTML, CSS and Javs Script class about half way through (chapter 4), because I need some piratical application.  However, this course gave me the foundation.  It's good to get error msgs!!!  Looking forward to taking the rest of the series!"
2016-11-03,Bogdan B,5,0,"Outstanding introduction to Python programming language that will lay strong foundation to the more advanced topics about Python. The teaching style is superb and the things you learn stick in the long term memory really quickly. You need, however, to put additional effort on your side in order to truly ""get"" what's going on and learn and program as much as you can, as doing is really learning. Excellent, excellent course, teacher and the community."
2020-09-28,Tanu S,5,0,"This is the best course ever, I have never enjoyed any course this much. I would like to thank Dr. Chuck for putting so much efforts to make students learn at their best. Everything about this course is so perfect , the assessments, the quiz which helps to brush up your skill. I have never been to complete any course yet, this was the first one, again Amazing content , and the most amazing instructor. Thankyou coursera, for bringing up this course."
2022-09-03,Dhruv K,5,0,"I got this course in the financial aid. Trust me guys this is one of the finest and most structured course for python on internet. Though i have completed only 1st part of the course that is 1-5 chapters of the book PY4E but still i feel confident about writing python code for what i have learnt. If you take this course you will master the basics of python and gradually improve and be ready for placement. Thank you, i think that is enough for now.  "
2020-04-09,Sneh S,5,0,"
his is a well-designed, well-taught course to learn about basics of 
python and control flow.Apart form engaging teaching and amazing 
content, I loved the Bonus videos(they were really insightful, made me 
surprised and motivated at the same time, to learn python and 
programming) and Dr. Chuck's goal behind teaching this course is really 
inspiring. It also gives a glimpse of how programs work under the
hood 
on the hardware viz. memory, CPU etc.

"
2020-01-14,Jack M,5,0,"Excellent Course! This course really gives someone the foundation of python coding and gives yourself early confidence in learning this skill to continue to take on new challenges in working towards being an expert. You will not come away with building any major project from this class, but it will definitely give you the foundation in getting to build that next level of this skill. If you are an aggressive learner you can complete within 2 weeks. "
2022-04-28,Rip S,5,0,"Excellent beginner course! I had some previous coding experience, so some of the in-depth explanations were kind of redundant for me, but I thought they were excellent, especially for anyone with no coding experience. And I learned a lot about some of the Python syntax and how it differs from other languages. The problems were interesting and fun, and challenging. I do wish we could run the code in something other than the command prompt, though. "
2020-12-02,Andres E L M,5,0,"  Just excellent, a really good professor, you can notice that he loves what he does, and that it´s the best way to do things, I will try to do all courses of Python from University of Michigan for sure. Thank you so much for this experience Professor. The only problem with this course is that it is my first one in coursera and It set the bar too high. Best regards to Charles Severance if you reads this, and again thank you so much for teaching us.  "
2020-05-07,Desika G,5,0,"As the course says, programming here is for everybody! Even a person with zero programming knowledge can easily crack this up. It is a very user friendly learning tool. One can easily finish the course with so much flexibility and adaptiveness. The course is really qualitative and suits a developing programmer who's needs are simple. I am completely satisfied with the course as it met my goal which was to learn the first step of coding in python.  "
2019-04-27,kush s,5,0,"  This is the perfect course for someone who is a beginner.  I understood the logic and  made it simple to remember how to program. The instructor and lessons are understandable and fun to learn and I can say I actually learned how to program.   I came from zero python knowledge and was very pleased with what I acquired over this course. Additionally, the professor is very personable and  about the course material and the delivery method. Thank you  "
2016-01-22,Hèlen G,5,0,Rating 5 stars for teaching style. When you are largely unfamiliar with programming it is important to not skip silly steps in explanation that might seem obvious. The information was very compact with made it easily digestible and encouraging to continue to the next level. The exercises increased nicely in complexity without sudden jumps in knowledge so that it would not give  the impression that you are stuck forever in the pit hole of doom ;-)
2016-09-09,慈曦,5,0,"This course is just amazing.

It help me start learning Python and also help to improve my English.

The professor is excellent and also very funny,i like him.

Course material is the reason that i choose the course.This course has a chinese subtitle,and also has a PDF version of the book(which also has translated into chinese),it's so good.

I will take the following course as well,and i think it will also help me a lot.

I'm looking forword to it."
2021-01-01,omar b,5,0,"I think that the course was very good. If you are a beginner and want to choose the right way to learn Python, this course is a good option, but in order to establish a strong foundation, you must continue to apply what you learn in the course. I think it would have been better if the course had included more exercises, not for evaluation but only training exercises.

Many thanks to everyone who worked hard to produce this educational material."
2020-06-28,Michael W,5,0,Easy to understand and follow along. Having the lecture's typed out helped a lot with taking notes and going back over information that was mentioned and if something was mentioned quickly but you did not quite catch. Allowed to take your time and give your the resource to understand the material. Great instructor that clearly explained the material as well as gave easy examples for first time programmers to better understand what is going on. 
2020-06-25,Esmerelda M B D M,5,0,"This is an excellent course for a beginner with no coding background like myself. After contemplating on which course to start on learning programming, I am so glad I took this one.  This course built up my confidence in taking the challenge to learn something totally new! Lectures were engaging, study materials were adequate, reading the free online book before watching lecture videos really helped too. Thank you Prof. Chuck, you are awesome! "
2018-03-07,kazuki m,5,0,"I'm Japanese.This is my second online lecture and I enjoyed it. For people who has some programming experience in other programming language like me, maybe this lecture seems a little boring and prolix.But if you hadn't write python,you want to study python,you don't want to overlook fundamental python syntax and you need experience of lecture by English teacher without your mother language subscript,this lecture will be good for your future."
2015-12-04,Md M R,5,0,"Hello There! I am a PHP web application developer and I am highly interested to make myself a good programmer.

2020-06-06,Abdul M,5,0,"Dr. Chuck certainly has made a difference for me. His approach to teaching this class was natural, didn't even feel like an on-line course, and he certainly knows how to break the subject down into manageable bits. The quiz you get after a chapter is neither too simple nor too hard to grasp, just the right level of complexity to stimulate your thinking and thought process. Very well made, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested. "
2020-09-05,Debasmita M,5,0,"This course is very helpful and anyone can do this, as its name says Programming for Everybody, a person who has not done any programming before can also do this course. It will clear your basics and will make it stronger. It will cover all the basic concepts with examples and assignments. And Dr. Chuck is a very good mentor. I can assure you that you will not only learn from this course but you will also enjoy doing this course. Thank you."
2020-03-08,SADAM H,5,0,"I learnt lot of things from here, i never used language before this course, because of my background is based on networking, i never think about that i can use language, Learning Python is very interesting, when you have such a nice Instructor like sir in ""Programming for Everybody "".

2020-10-19,Muhammad A b A B,5,0,"First of all, I would like to thanks to Sir Charles Russell Severance  for the amazing course he created.  All the videos and explanation in this course are easy to understand. Before this, I thought that python is really hard to be learnt, but I found it opposite after I enrolling the course. I really enjoyed it. Now I am considering to take the next step and enroll for the other Sir Charles course related to python. Well done to you Sir."
2020-07-24,NIRANJAN M,5,0,  The course is absolutely well organised with proper guidance and teaching.The course guide Dr.Chuck (Charles Severance) is absolute fun to be with.He is a complete package of excellent teaching along with fun at the same time.The course is excellent for beginners where he starts from basics and make us understand about the working i.e how python executes.Pretty excited for further courses to know more about python from this great professor  
2020-07-22,Tom R,5,0,"A good introduction for beginners, rather too slow for someone who knows other languages. Given some people might never go beyond the first 7 weeks, I'd try to offer some more practical example, like why someone would want to use it. I see writing some command line utilities might be helpful, like perhaps processing a text file and removing double spaces, or something useful. But I understand why ""toy"" examples are necessary for beginners.
"
2020-07-10,Plínio L,5,0,"I liked every second of this course, its a good thing to remember concepts of algorithm, Python is very easy in comparison to other languages (COUGH* Java) and was not disturbing, the teacher is great and attentive, the way Charles teached was a major differential, so i learned more than i tought i could learn, i'll get to the ""part 2"" of the course soon, just because i loved Python, and want to learn more about it.
Thank you all very much!"
2016-12-14,Michael V D,5,0,This is an excellent course and Dr. Severance makes the learning fun. Course 1 of 5 is extremely beginner level so if you already have some coding experience and find yourself getting bored with the detailed explanation of each bit try setting video speed to 2x. I did so and it helped me to stay focused during times that would have felt like over explanation. Plus Dr. Severance is quite fun to listen to and watch at twice his normal speed!
2020-12-23,Sukhdeep S,5,0,"This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to. I have taken where the teachers were reading and got the intonation all wrong--very distracting. This one wasn't like that by far. He was interesting and even funny at times. "
2020-09-03,Richard C,5,0,"Worth the time and the instructor made it even better to understand the course. I especially like the Harry Potter reference to making a choice to learn coding or python. It is worth learning programing, to use a reference, ""it's better to learn to use digital music than trying to figure out why no one has 8-tracks any more."" Technology is moving at a high speed and learning programming is part of it, and this course will get you started."
2018-03-05,Muhammad Z S L,5,0,"It was a brilliant experience to study by the method Coursera has provided me. I am obliged to every single person who is somehow associated in the development of this worthy platform. Especial thanks to my instructor Dr. Charles R.

Thankyou Coursera...:)))   "
2020-04-10,Francisco L A B,5,0,It was so good to learn the basics of Python with such an enthusiastic teacher! Dr Chuck takes into account that each one of us can have a different background with the world of programming and adapts the course for a beginners level. The presentations are clear and straight to the point and the activities at the end of each session necessary to test the new concepts. I highly recommend this course if you would like to start programming.

I found the course fantastic! I would recommend it to everyone who has not added the skill of programming to their set of Skills. With such a great teacher as Charles Severance, you'd enjoy every bit of the course and also understand the very basic things you need to know about python! I'm glad I took the course. I've learned so much, and even so, easily. So interesting and easily learned that I spent a day in finishing the whole course!

2016-04-21,Yumei L,5,0,"Took this as ""Programming for Everybody""--my very first programming class. Loved it. It was hard from time to time, but well worth it. It's not likely I will do programming for a living, but understanding this medium makes a big difference for me when I encounter issues related to technology, data and the web. I believe everyone can benefit from some exposure to the world of programming. And this is by far the best course offered online."
2016-03-24,Anton K,5,0,"This course not just about syntax of programming language (unlike many other courses for beginners). It teaches you think as a programmer. It was pretty interesting to know how hardware works and how computer structure influences the coding. I found lots of great examples and the particular cases on the conditions, loops, and functions that can now be used by me in JavaScript and Swift. The best tutorial on code basics! Thanks Dr. Chuck!"
2018-10-10,Victor E,5,0,"There is nothing better than being taught by passionate people. Charles Severance is one of those rare gems of education. Online learning was also new to me and definitely something very I wish I had been able to do when I was studying 20 years ago.
The bonus videos were very interesting and this is something that adds a lot of value to the course.
I have done the first course only (in 3 days) and will try to wrap the specialization soon."
2021-02-18,Justin J,5,0,"This is one of the best introductory courses in Python. It's very easy to understand and follow for beginners. It not just focuses on python specifically but on the overall concept of elements of programming which the lane can apply to other programming languages.

Already experienced programmers can use this as a refresher course to sharpen their understanding of certain concepts.

it's so exciting and fun while you learn this course.

2020-09-03,Aarya P,5,0,A really nice introductory style course for the python. I had no experience for python but however i did knew a bit of coding and stuff. The very basics concepts have been taught and helps you understand the building blocks on any code or program and how it executes. The instructor  has a very nice mood and helps you learn things with Fun and sometime even lightens your mood by punching some nice old jokes... i like it and its awesome.
2020-07-26,Paul O,5,0,"This course is a great introduction for anyone who has no background at all in computer programming. The instructor is spot on - he's friendly, patient and it's very easy to follow what he's trying to explain.
I did have some previous experience with Stata so it was easier for me to follow as I already understood some basic concepts. But I bet this course can be useful to anyone with a hint of enthusiasm, regardless of their background."
2020-12-06,Ronald B,5,0,"Dr. Charles Serverance is truly passionate in his craft and wants you to learn. If your looking to get an introduction to Python, or to get your feet wet in Python programming then this is the course for you. So glad to take this course and learn something new. Hopefully build the confidence to teach and encourage my friends to take this course. Looking forward to completing remaining courses for this specialization. Highly recommend. "
2019-02-06,AKSHADA S,5,0,I m very thankful for the team coursera who given me the opportunity to complete the course and providing me the certificate.I m very thanfull to team coursera you consider my financial aid and allow me to freely join the course.This certificate plays very important role in my carrer.thank you so much coursera.Its my pleasure towards you.please give me such a more opportunities so could i expand my carrer at a great height............
2015-12-20,Adam M,5,0,"I am a GIS Analyst who could really benefit from an improved Python skill set.  In the past I have tried to take Python courses but became frustrated early on in the classes for a variety of reasons (not enough background info on topics, not enough instructor support, etc.).  This class really helped me understand the basics and perhaps more importantly, it piqued my interest.  Dr. Severence is great.  Stay quirky!  It is lots of fun.
"
2022-07-03,Pegah Z,5,0,I tried to study python many times before with different videos and online resources. The point is the data out there are too much and not categorized well for a self learner with no background but the basics of programming with other languages. This course was different. For the first time I found the clues and spent several times on learning. I am looking forward the other cources in this Programming for every body with Dr. Chunck.
2019-11-18,Vik M,5,0,"An excellent introductory course to learn the basic concepts and thought patterns that everyone needs to be able to combine basic programming skills with their current line of work. The class uses practical examples that most of us can relate to instead of theoretical ones. I highly recommend starting with this course before taking more advanced programming courses, especially if you have no prior programming education or experience."
2018-10-26,Harry E J J,5,0,"Great course.  Very approachable, well taught, well paced.  Well suited to people completely new to computer programming and for those with computer experience looking to learn Python.  The professor is great!  He does an excellent job of explaining the what, why, and how of basic computer programming concepts.  Which will serve you well no matter what language you learn going forward, as the concepts apply across software languages."
2017-04-10,Heinrich A,5,0,"
Interesting introduction course for people who want to learn Python. You don't need programming skills (though they always come in handy), because the course starts at the very beginning. I guess this helps everybody to easily adapt to the language, which itself in my opinion is pretty straight forward and quite easy to learn. I'm really looking forward to the more tricky and complex parts in the other courses of this specialization."
2021-01-10,Juliet X,5,0,"This course is awwwwwesome! Professor Charles makes very good examples in the course and puts them in a really humorous way. 
I have learned a little bit of programming back in college (Visual Basic was the language I learned), so most of the knowledge taught in this course is pretty basic and easy for me. But as the course flows, it gets manageably harder and I love the challenges it offers! 
Feels great to solve puzzle after puzzle!"
2021-08-19,MUHAMMAD A,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is really great at telling the minor things in programming of which new comers are really worried of. He explains it so beautifully that no matter what your background is, whether you are of mechanical background or something else, Dr. Chuck is the best teacher for you on Coursera to tell you ""How To Program?"" as this course is named Python for everyone, it's true anyone can learn this language easily through this course."
2021-04-27,Rahul K K,5,0,"  I'm from mechanical engineering background and I was actually here because i need to complete this course as a part of my curriculum but it is really interesting. i had fun learning and Dr. Charles Severance, he explained the topics like you explain it to a kid. its great! i recommend it to all age groups and watch the bonus videos after each chapter (gives you a little insight on how the tech came to life... really inspiring sh*t)  "
2020-06-18,Akshith G,5,0,"Very very well taught from the very basics, beautifully explained with fun bonus sections as well, would definitely recommend enthusiast learners to begin with this course if you want to begin with programming in python. Fairly easy and good number of assignments which at times really tests what you have learnt to make one learn the concepts in depth and understand it well. Thank you coursera and Dr. Chuck for this wonderful course "
2018-05-21,Waqas U R,5,0,Before this course I always thought of programming as a frightening monster. But enrolling in this course was on of the best things to happen as the instructor taught and carried out this course in a very elegant way. The course was well paced and I never felt throughout this course that It couldn't be completed successfully as it happened before in other programming courses at my institute. Thank you Charles and thank you coursera
2017-09-13,Sherry A,5,0,"Great course. For me it was a refresher of the basic programming skills that I learned in undergrad but have rarely put to use. I needed to know very basic things like what editor to use, how to run python files, and the syntax / structure of loops, etc. I got all that and more! I appreciate the instructors enthusiasm, and I think this course could be a good introduction to programming for students who have never programmed before. "
2017-07-09,Gregorio A A P,5,0,"Excelente, un gran curso con un enfoque de calidad al 100%, solo que es lamentable no poder disfrutar el curso al 100% en el idioma español ya que no todo el contenido esta traducido, si fuera posible seria muy bueno que lo traduzcan todo al español ya que existe gran demanda por parte de los estudiantes de latino america el querer aprender cursos de gran calidad como este.
Nuevamente felicitaciones por la calidad del curso. Saludos"
2016-02-09,Wilman M R C,5,0,"I have see many courses of computer programing in courser, some are not really good and some are not really for beginners (even if they say it). So I follow this course ones before and I din not finish but I really like it, because is for beginners, is clear and slow in the way to show the topic, is fun, but also and most importan I feel like I'm learning a lot. Almost finish course 1 and really optimistic to do all specialization. "
2020-08-12,Jessie,5,0,"This is the first online course I have ever completed. It has been an amazing journey. With limited knowledge in computer science, I never truly imagined myself being able to write lines of codes. Dr. Chuck is an excellent teacher. I adore him for making this intimidating course accessible and enjoyable. I also truly appreciate Coursera for granting me a scholarship to take this course free. I cannot wait to start the next course. "
2020-05-06,VENKAT R B,5,0,"i am sure about my research in ""structural optimization of high rise buildings""  it is helpful to write some sub programmes to find maximum displacements, story stiffness, fundamental frequencies, story drift, time period etc. from  software (like ETABS, STAAD, etc.,) output. i observed while learning my courses all the speakers are given very inspired sessions. i thank to god give me opportunity to learn in this  online coursera."
2020-01-25,Wesley P,5,0,"This course is an excellent and detailed introduction into how to code the basics of python. The examples in the free book provided are a very helpful companion to the assignments in the course. They don't give the whole answer, which makes you think critically and logically about the code you need to write. Stick with it and you will get the rewards, I've already started the 2nd course in this specialization. Thank you Dr. Chuck!"
2017-09-05,Anmol P,5,0,"This course is really helpful for people who are planning to try hands in the field of computation. Python I feel is a good platform to gain some coding experience because:
a) It is easy to comprehend with simple syntax.
b) It is very flexible.
c)It adds good value to your CV. 
And I feel Professor Charles Severance has done a good job. I think maybe it will be better for the beginners to use the book along as they progress.
Thank you."
2022-08-29,Madhava R M,5,0,A wonderful and excellent and amazing course to learn about python. I have learnt a lot about the programming  language python from this course. The question sets which are also asked in the graded assignments are good and the course content is well designed and structured starting from the first week to the last week.I am so thankful to the university of michigan and to the coursera platform for providing such wonderful courses.
2020-07-06,Yusuf N S,5,0,"  For me this course with very easy as I had previous knowledge of Computer programming with C++, The course instructor is more than awesome, he makes it seem so simple and force you to love the course. Python is a very important language that is interfering with almost every field in the tech industry. This course gives you a great introduction to a language of a great importance and also introduce the computer science through it.  "
2019-10-04,Janet P d R,5,0,"I recommend this course for all those who have not been previously linked to the programming as it shows you the basics to get started. It is made for the public in general.

For those who speak Spanish as mother tongue, I recommend to use the English subtitles option so you can more easily follow the teacher and notice small details, which are often necessary in programming.

Thanks to the teacher for his pleasant way of teaching."
2019-09-03,Yurshanva K,5,0,"As the name itself says "" Programming for Everybody"" is indeed for all, i thought i would lose interest from week 1 but i did not and here I am, finally i have completed course 1. Now I'am definitely going to continue course 2, and thank you so much for the understandable teaching, it was like a story, not confusing at all. Also, because of this course, I'am going to pursue a career in programming. Really inspired by this course. "
2020-08-18,Duha,5,0,"The way the course has been made and taught is amazing! It introduces is a course TRULY designed for absolute beginners. I enjoyed the course and Dr. Chuck is simply amazing. If you have a background in any other coding language, the concepts of this course feel like a summer breeze, with a few python specific syntax here and there. Overall I enjoyed the course and managed to finish it way ahead of schedule. Thank you Dr. Chuck!"
2020-07-05,Manasa C,5,0,"It is the best course for the python beginner to learn the syntax...
If the student is aware of other programming languages like c, c++ and java. you can complete this course in 2 days.
if you are not aware of other courses then you need to see the textbook that was suggested and I would suggest another text book for python that is Python crash course by Eric Matthes. This is one of the good book for python to learn......basics..."
2020-06-19,Jesús A M G,5,0,"Este curso es una excelente herramienta para comprender las bases de la programación en Python. La forma en la que se presentan los contenidos en muy buena y fácil de seguir, y los ejercicios realmente te hacen comprender este lenguaje de programación. Recomiendo a los que lleven este curso que utilicen la herramienta Atom, así como el Command Prompt (mencionados en el curso) para la programación y las pruebas de los ejercicios."
2017-10-03,Deleted A,5,0,"In my opinion this was an excellent course. All the information was available, and well explained. The professor Dr. Chuck it's a great teacher, he made me laugh a couple of times, so I really enjoy all the videos and excercises. I found very interesting all the interviews to famous people, such as Guido Van Rossum, Massimo Banzi and Daphne Koller. Thanks so much to everyone who makes this course possible and thanks to Coursera."
2017-08-17,Miska J,5,0,"Like the title states, 'Getting started..'. So if you have prior programming experience this might feel a bit elementary, but if you're completely new to Python there's still plenty of things to get you going faster with Python. And if you're completely new to programming... This course is definitely bang for the buck! Very easy to follow, great examples to get things sinking in fast and in overall, very well constructed course."
2022-06-30,Isiah R W,5,0,"​Gave me a good foundation on functions, operators, and loops. I learned how to create code for a program to do simple calculations (add, sub, mult., division, averages), how to ask for user_inputed data, and data type conversion (ex. string data converted to integer or float data). I don't feel like I'm a programmer yet but I am surprised by how much I picked up and am excited to see my progress as this is still my first week."
2021-04-17,Mo A,5,0,It is a pleasure learning from prof. Severance! I am a programmer myself and it is important to me when a professor talks in basics and includes history that makes course interesting and knowledgeable. I am a 'Teacher Type' myself so I like learning things from ground up. Exercises and problems should keep students at the keyboard and I thin prof. Severance did that for me with while-loop min-max problem! it is a great problem!
2020-11-14,Mehta S,5,0,"  This course experience was on par with in-person lectures I have had in my university, maybe even better. Professor Charles Russell Severance is an exceptional teacher and makes the course content quite easy to grasp by delivering the lectures sequentially, systematically, and keeping the audience in mind.Like all the other reviewers, I am quite satisfied and would highly recommend anyone aspiring to learn Python to start here.  "
2020-07-13,NURUL A B J A N,5,0,"Its easy to understand! You've got a plenty of time to complete all courses. Don't give up, your almost there :)



The instructor explains the code in such a simplest way you could imagine, you always can pause and rewind if anything falls behind. The courses are split to 2 which you still can continue to learn after completed the part 1. Overall its a great experience to learn python with coursera! You should give it a try too."
2020-04-30,Alif A 1,5,0,"This course was a lot of fun. If you're completely new to programming, this is a very basic and easy course so you won't likely have any trouble understanding. However, if you have prior knowledge in programming in a different language and taking this course just to learn Python syntax, you should complete the course very fast and move to the next one to get more in depth knowledge in Python because this will be a bit too easy."
2020-04-12,Aaron L,5,0,"This course is helpful for being introduced to Python. The only comments I have is to maybe increase the amount of exercises to really drill the concepts in. Also, to include all current chapter components learned into the current chapter exercise. For example, try and except wasn't applied until the next chapter or two. Not a real problem, but would be helpful while it is still fresh and able to work a few different exercises."
2020-09-29,Sarvesh M,5,0,"Really good course . I have learnt a lot in this course's graded assignments and quizzes and also from the video lectures . I do recommend this great course for everyone who is just beginning to learn python. Great course . Thank you Dr . Charles Severance . I am really grateful to coursera and to Dr.Chuck for this wonderful course. I sincerely thank my instructor, University of Michigan and Coursera for this wonderful course."
2019-02-08,Thiago R,5,0,"I'm studying programming to change my career. I always thought programming was very difficult, a job for a few brilliant minds only, but Dr. Chuck made me believe it is doable. Don´t get me wrong! Programming takes A LOT of work, but it is far from impossible... Also, learning only the basics in programming already gives you a totally different view of the world. Thank you Dr. Chuck and Coursera, you literally changed my life."
2018-09-08,Rajneesh G,5,0,"I have completed this course,in a weekend spending 3-4 hours a days and found the course difficulty to be easy.
The course is really easy to understand and the assignments and quiz makes it easy to build the concepts. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to start Python programming. The way Dr. Charles teaches the concepts is a very interactive fashion and this keeps you motivated to complete the course. Thank you."
2018-05-21,Hamad A,5,0,"I was already familiar with programing basics (if statements, while loop, for loop, etc.), and I took this course to familiarize myself with python syntax. If this is your first time programming, I highly recommend this course. Lectures provide great explanations of python basics and Prof. Severance is an entertaining lecturer. However, while lectures are great, I wish the course had more practice problems for each assignment."
2017-08-07,vipin p,5,0,"A very creative, simple and clear way to explain a language you might have no idea about. Hats off to Dr Charles Severance for his great work to move from one point to another. I really appreciate it. The method of teaching is simple and increases your rate to learn. I will not hide the fact that it was my first time I wanted to learn more and more. Thank you Coursera and Dr Charles Severance for making it memorable. Loved it! "

Thank you!"
2020-11-05,nourin a,5,0,"It was an amazing experience. Before the course, I had lots of doubts that I may not keep pace with the programming as I am new to this field. But, I learnt a lot following the flow of course. The additional material in form of book is the I thing I loved the most. It helped me a lot to learn and revise the concepts learnt from amazing Dr. Chuck from book! Thanks Coursera for the learning platform and financial aid approval!"
2020-09-04,Angela P,5,0,"I enjoyed this course very much, I had zero previous experience and it was relatively easy to understand the concepts plus the professor was really engaging. I had some difficulties with the assignments but I got my questions answered through the forum or searching help online. I did enjoy the videos about office hours and tech conversations, I learned interesting facts I didn't know from them. I'm planning to keep learning."
2022-01-13,Heng Z,5,0,"I have to say that this course is the best course of Python beginners online. I didn't learn any programming language before, but Dr. Charles makes this course very very interesting. I really enjoy the whole class including the bonus video. I will go to US for my graduate study of Marketing Analysis this fall. So if I could have other opportunity to learn Dr. Charles's other course about programming, I would like to attend. "

"
2020-06-24,METTA J,5,0,The course was great. This is my first course on Coursera and am pretty happy with the way it progressed. It gave me an insight into the basics of Python programming and helped me write simple programs on my own. The speaker was too good at explaining minute things which help error-free programming. I am grateful to the speaker for helping me set my first step into Python programming and will always be thankful to you Sir.
2020-05-16,SAGAR U,5,0,"  This course is what I was looking for - an inexpensive course that covers all the important topics in detail!I would recommend everyone who's looking to learn to program to start with this course, as it builds the required concepts in a systematic approach.It is better if you download the free pdf of the book that was recommended in Week 1 of the course, as it has all the theory required to keep up with the lecture videos.  "
2021-03-17,H.T.S.C. L,5,0,Absolutely wonderful! I never thought this course could gave me such kind of goosebumps. Dr.Chuck's teaching was on that top. It really meant the title of 'Programming for Everybody'. I was here to do my lab session as a part of my university work. And when you're doing those assignments and quizes it feels that you're exists on this modern technological world. Thank you Dr. Charles and Coursera team for this opportunity.
2020-05-14,Hemendra K,5,0,"IT is very usefulful to me because I am from Mechanical Department and it is beginning for me.
I didn't expected that i can learn and implement the python language. 
Thank you so much Dr. Charles who teach a very beautiful and meaningful class. And thank you coursera for giving us an opportunity to learn something in free of cost. Thank you everybody,

2020-05-09,Md A P,5,0,"I actually had previous python knowledge, and i have working on other programming languages for the past one year. But this course is very recommended for absolute beginners who want to get to know about programming language. Well, if you're not a CS student, you can take this course anyway. No problem at all, because the topics were very basic, and the teacher delivered them very nicely with relatable examples. Thank you"
2020-04-19,Phani d,5,0,"Mr. Charles is a wonderful tutor and has put so much thought into explaining the control flow of python language. I'm a computer science student so most of the concepts explained are familiar to me, even if you are a beginner he completely breaks down each and everything he explains which is extremely useful in burying the concepts in your mind. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to get started with python."
2019-12-30,Robson,5,0,"Learning is more than repeat guided steps in order to master them.
Learning is a change behavior of the brain in order to see the world differently. 
So this course not only teach me how to program but also enhace my sensebility of seeing things around me. 
To become a programer, to become a better person, to become more focused to become wise i recommend this classes. 
Thank you a lot for all involved in this awesome course."
2017-07-23,Mark L,5,0,"Really enjoyed the course. The material is clear and well presented, and the quality of tuition was brilliant. Very helpful discussion boards and relatively challenging assignments that force you to apply what you have learned. The pace is pretty relaxed which is great if you have a fulltime job or other commitments - then again, it is an introductory course, so that might be expected. Can't really think of any negatives."
2020-08-28,Rishav A,5,0,"I have worked on python previously . I just wanted to brush up my skills, so I looked up for some courses here and I found this one with good review. I wasn't so sure , therefore I thought to go through couple of videos. And I completed the whole course because it was really a good one. I feel this course is quiet good and for beginners , its best. I would recommend to do couple of videos and you will know why I say so ."
2019-01-26,Mario A L,5,0,"This course is perfect if you have zero to little experience on the overall basic programming paradigm. It contains simple but insightful exercises which will help you to understand concepts (from variable declaration to loops) with ease (the teacher is great). If you are fairly used to dealing with programming and you need something challenging, then this course could seem too much easy and familiar, but helpful anyway."
2017-03-22,Taufik S,5,0,"Charles is an excellent tutor. His tutorials insists that you, as someone who is taking baby steps in programming, to not take shortcuts and develop your command of the language akin to someone learning composition in elementary school. Makes you comfortable with the syntax, gets your confidence running, and then introduce the complex stuff. 
He's a tutor that doesn't make your programming experience mundane. Recommended. "
2020-09-22,Mutayyib M K,5,0,"Absolutely amazing. The flow of Professor Charles Severance is super easy to understand and follow. Super appreciation to the University of Michigan and Prof. Chuck for creating this. 
A suggestion- Maybe a few un graded sample problems may be added after every week. These may be kept a bit tricky and have a time limit of say, 3-4 hours to solve, after which the solved code is shown. That will immensely help for practice"
2020-07-09,Abdullah A,5,0,This course is literally for everybody who wants to learn programming and does not know where to start from.  For me this is the first step to enter the realm of data science  as this course enabled me to learn python programming from scratch. It also helped me revise the most basic programming principles. I highly recommend this course to all the beginners and to all who want to learn this amazing programming language.   
2020-04-20,Amit k s,5,0,"This course is very helpful for those guys who start the python as their first language. Also if you are at the beginner level or you didn't know about python then this course is very helpful for you. I myself complete this course and also recommend you guys to enrolled for this course.
and at last I am very thankful to coursera for providing this course. And also i am very thankful to Charles Russell Severance Thank you

2020-03-17,LAVISH G,5,0,  Dr. chuck is able to deliver this course in a very organised way and in very short videos that makes the learning very easy and enjoyable. Course is very nice and can easily be understood by a learner who doesn't have any prior knowledge of programming. It is easy to take notes while learning and assignments are like small hands-on project to make your concepts strong. Hence overall this course is worth taking. Thankyou  
2020-01-24,Omkar S,5,0,"This was my first ever online course and it was a great experience indeed. I had never thought that an online course would be so much effective. I gained a plenty of knowledge through this course; thanks to Dr. Charles Severance for such a wonderful teaching. After completing this course, I have no fear towards programming. It was an fantastic experience overall and I will definitely recommend this course to my friends.  "
2019-08-24,Luis L,5,0,"Este curso comprende los fundamentos básicos de la programación en Pyhton. El Profesor Charles Severance y su forma tan única de impartir el curso, hace que el aprendizaje se lleve de una manera tranquila y amena, lo cual es fundamenta para que haya una mayor comprensión de los temas impartidos en el curso. Por lo anterior, agradezco la oportunidad brindada la cual fue indispensable para poder finalizar este gran curso."
2018-11-15,Louise W,5,0,"For students like me who have no prior experience in programming, this course is definite a great introduction!  The professor introduced each statement in an explicit way that explained the 'background thinking' of Python, which is very helpful when you try to understand how Python work. Also, discussion forum is a quite good resource as well, especially when I was dealing with assignments. Highly reommend this course!"
2017-10-30,Dounia Z,5,0,"I really enjoyed this course ; something that could have been complicated and maybe even boring became quite fun to learn thanks to an excellent teacher! For people whose first language is NOT english : even if you don't choose to put the subtitles -or your language isn't in the list-, the english used is easy enough to understand, I didn't have any problems with it even when I was really tired. Good luck and thank you!"
2021-08-22,Jordan M E A,5,0,"Como alguien que ya tiene experiencia programando con un lenguaje mas estructurado como lo es JAVA y que también posee conocimientos intermedios como los son el manejo de las estructuras de datos y demás, este curso fue muy bueno para repasar las bases de la programación.

Aprender python en este curso resulto muy ameno e interesante, si eres alguien con experiencia en menos de 1 día se completa muy satisfactoriamente."
2021-05-17,Jakub Š,5,0,"Great course!
Note onThe Assignment 5.2 prompted me saying I should calculate the minimum and maximum (which I have been doing all along, the real issue was that  I have been using a fixed flag value and not a None value for the variables. This has been quite misleading and frustrating. Would be great if people could be better pointed towards what is wrong (a note on using None instead of a fixed flag value might help)."
2020-03-22,Muhammad B,5,0,"The course was easy to understand for people with no prior programming experience and was well designed for distance learning.  Dr. Charles has a fun way of explaining the dry concepts and the bonus videos really helped me in understanding the bigger picture for doing this course. I initially planned to attend this course twice a week but found myself making time for it every day of the week.
Great stuff and thank you !"
2019-12-24,Jacob E,5,0,I took the whole specialization which I strongly recommend over individual pieces. These courses go through a book provided by Charles Severance. He includes all the material and TONS of code he made. Charles goes through all the code he brings up in the class and explains each piece. There are fluff pieces throughout that are not necessary to pass but offer some history. Overall a great course with a great instructor.
2016-10-05,Ricardo F,5,0,"
The course was really well presented, taught and clear, and although i would prefer it would have been taught in the newer version of python, it actually helped me to do some research and learn new material.
A warm special thanks to Prof. Charles Severance for his logical and laid back approach.
I hope that a follow up to some more advanced programming in Python will take place in the future.
Many thanks Ricardo Fernandes"
2016-03-20,garland j,5,0,"I really enjoy the videos describing the history of the language.  The exercises were very good and the 'Office Hours' videos were lots of fun.  Its really great to see how many people are interested in Python all around the world.  These all provided a good foundation.  I also thought it was great to be able to do the exercises and programming problems at any time.   I look forward to the second course in this series.   
"
2021-01-26,Savaş A,5,0,"As a C/C++ programmer, I want to learn Python and I decided to learn from the beginning. Actually, this course is very simple for me and people like me (previously experienced) but I can easily advice this course to anyone wants to learn Python from the beginning because the teacher's expression is so clear, the examples are very useful, assignments are very good for the beginning. I can say this is a good experience."
2017-02-25,Jared B,5,0,"Excellent course.  A very useful introduction to those who want to dive into Python.  I especially recommend for those who are less comfortable with the process of computer programming, as this course will introduce and reinforce the concepts of iterating, construction of while, for loops, and the ins and outs of conditionals.  
In short, if you are looking for a gentle introduction that has useful examples this is it!"
2020-10-29,Bolivar S,5,0,"                 Excellent
course, very interactive, all the tools have been well designed and thought for
the support of the learning process, the assignments and tasks required
throughout the course integrate all the knowledge and helps you to solve doubts
that may emerge during this asynchronic classes. For me, this has been a really
great experience and I recommend this course for everyone who’s interested in
computer programming    "
2020-09-18,Avani K,5,0,I really found this course easy to follow and it explained the fundamentals really well. I just want to say thank you to Charles Severance - I liked the way he presented the course and you can tell he has a great passion for this subject and his explanations were very clear. I haven't done Computer Science for a very long time and have recently decided to back to it and I'm really looking forwards to the next course!
2020-09-10,Nico P,5,0,"Muy buen curso , con muy buenos contenidos me sirvió muchísimo para volver a repasar conceptos que tenia un poco olvidados , el profesor explica muy bien , me encanto, definitivamente seguiré con los próximos módulos. 
Very good course with very good content it helped me a lot to go over concepts that I had a little forgotten. The profesor explains very well I loved it I will definitely continue with the next modules."
2020-07-08,Thisie D,5,0,"This course was excellent. Dr. Chuck is great at explaining things in very thorough detail to ensure that everybody understands the course. I really enjoyed it, and he made it easy to learn! The way he teaches really does make Python available to everybody! Although some things were review for me, I was glad to review them going into learning a new programming language. Thank you, Dr. Chuck, for the excellent class!!"
2020-07-03,Atharva V,5,0,"Very easy to digest. Had a problem with the final exercise. The code I made was an optional experiment which I keep doing for every single lecture. Using lists in python, I made a code in which the user can choose LARGE or SMALL, to be found. But when I edited the code for the final assignment to run simultaneously, very weirdly, the code worked for large, but not for small. took me an hour to finish that assignment,"
2022-06-10,Brandon D,5,0,"I am currently a Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force. My career in the military is heavily based on data analytics and database management. However, we do not have any militray course, and hardly anyone in my career field knows about python. This course gave me a clear, and accurate understanding of the basics of python. Super helpful and I recommend this course to anyone trying to learn python. Well done!"
2022-02-15,Per F,5,0,"I​t really is a course for beginners like they stated, and it definitely is for everyone. Can recommend it for anyone starting out, I had some previous experience in C++, so the course went by very fast, I think I completed it in 4 days? Watching everything on 1.5 speed definitely helped me understand the Python syntax! Awesome instructor btw! 

Only downside was that it is a little slow :). Still a 5/5 in my opinion. "
2022-01-12,Robert P,5,0,"A good introduction to programming and the syntax and semantics of the Python 3 programming language. I usually feel like the pace of introductory courses on a language or in CS in general is too high even for programmers with experience, and this course really bucks that trend and hits the sweet spot of content pacing. All of the challenges are easy but they do a good job of reinforcing the material of each lesson."
2021-01-27,Asadullah H,5,0,"This is a wonderful course for a gentle entry into the world of programming and python. Dr. Severance taught wonderfully, keeping the classes both beginner friendly and content rich.

I'll definitely do my best to continue to the next 4 parts of this specialisation, and I am glad that my money goes to this course - it's worth it!"
2020-06-12,IORPENDA    M    C,5,0,"This
course is excellent for people with little or no idea of programming. It takes
you from zero to a level where you feel confident in taking more courses in the
program.  The lectures are delivered in a
clear, direct, easy to understand and fun way. The course instructor through
this course has debunked the idea that programming is difficult to learn or
that programming is meant for only computer scientists."
2020-06-01,Joshua O,5,0,"This course is a great tool for beginners diving into the programming world. As a first in a series of courses, it illustrates and engages you to participate in creating simple but useful programs. Like every ""first step"", it gets interesting and you start to think of it less as ""impossible to do"" . I certainly learnt a lot and i'm ready to develop more to integrate my skills for solving problems with big data."
2018-07-24,Anya R,5,0,"Charles does a wonderful job explaining the basics of Python scripting. Some of his logic description is really helpful. With that said, this course may be a little too basic if you have had experience with other scripting or coding languages in the past. I have worked a little bit in csh and Java, and found it a little basic for me at times, but there were good nuggets of info. I'd say any coding beginner shou"
2021-08-24,Diego A B,5,0,"This course is an excellent choice for beginner programmers to start their adventure in this complex world. I personally already knew most of the concepts covered, but I can see the value this course has for beginners. Dr. Chuck does a wonderful job of explaining every little detail that is needed for anyone to understand. If you haven't done any programming before, look no further! This is the course for you."
2020-05-07,SUGAYATHRI D P,5,0,"  Dr.Chuck was the best instructor one could ever get. I've learned some many new concepts.

I like the flow chart and the summary of key concepts and key terminology of each lecture and chapters. Thank you. "
2021-07-27,Банный Ю В,5,0,"Excellent course! I was lucky. I ""accidentally"" decided to pass it. I experienced great pleasure from successful analogies in the process of explanation. I listened to wonderful stories told by people! I saw many places around the world with grateful students. Thank you to the creators who gave me the opportunity to get into the spirit of Python! P.S. (I...I...I...) It's a little pathetic, but it's true... :)"
2020-12-08, K R ,5,0,"It was an amazing experience. Thanks to Professor Charles for making it clearly understandable and easy to apprehend., he uses very pertinent exampes that help you cease the matter. The course covers enough basic knowledge on Python Programming to make you understand different blocks of codes and write some simple but efficient code. I have learnt a lot in this course and I'm so excited to go to the next one."
2020-06-23,Andre G,5,0,"A brief introduction to programming. If you are a beginner, you're probably going to love it. I already have a background on programming and I would say that for a advanced person, It will lack bonus materials and exercises as it is very simple and slow going. But despite of this fact, It is interesting to see how different teachers approach on the introductory subject using the most varied ways and examples."
2020-04-29,raja n r,5,0,"this program is too god,and my instructor is pretty good and a lot of stuff is with him.his way of teaching attracted me to watch the course without fail.i'm a mechanical student and this course learns you from the scratch without any prior knowledge.i suggest all to take a chance to enroll if you are intrested in programming.Finally,i thank my instructor Dr.Charles Severance  sir for learning me a new skill.

2017-06-07,Hanxiao Y,5,0,"Wow I have to say this is really a good course with excellent teacher! Before this course I have no idea of Python, I struggled and wasted a lot of time considering which language I should learn, Java or Python. Now after this course, I fall in love with Python, it's an elegant programming language easy to start with! For those who want to get start with their coding career, I strongly recommend this lecture!"
2016-08-07,Tanja Z,5,0,"Excellent beginner course for learning Python. The instructor slowly guides your thinking so that your thought process matches that of a Python programmer. Quizzes and especially assignments are relevant to testing your newly acquired skills. If you have a bit of experience in other languages, I recommend going quickly through the course, as I found a great deal of overlap in language that let me speed ahead."
2020-11-22,ushan m,5,0,"Oh, I love this course so much. I never though that I could learn the basics in the first attempt. Dr. Chuck is highly recommended for everyone who is willing to have a shot in python coding. He's the best lecturer for sure. he's so friendly. The course content is so clear so anyone can get it clearly. I would like to thank Coursera programs for letting us learn so much online. Thank you for the opportunity. "
2017-04-23,Thomas B,5,0,"I loved this course and Dr. Chuck makes it easy to follow. I have prior programming experience, but was self-taught, so this helped structure some of my learnings. My only suggestion is to use a different color instead of white on neon for the blackboard drawings to make them easier to see. Other than that, I give this course 5 stars. I'm looking forward to my next course in the Python specialization series."
2017-01-14,Joshua G,5,0,"Good basic intro.  Professor doesn't take himself too seriously which makes the lectures entertaining as well as informative.  I would recommend this to someone who has no coding experience.

2016-10-03,Daniel S,5,0,"This is a splendid introduction to a delightful and powerful programming language for the first-time programmer. But it's even more than that: Charles Severance is a gifted teacher who gets the neophyte up and running in a gentle and engaging style. Really! Anyone can learn to program a computer, and get a whiff of mastering technology. But beware! That whiff can lead to addiction... and not in a bad way..."
2020-04-23,Raymond C,5,0,"Dr. Chuck was an awesome teacher.  I really wished i had someone like him in HS and College for my CS classes. I wasn't a CS major, but it was taught like we were...he speaks in such easy and understandable terms.  His examples are spot on.  I am still learning and making mistakes, but it's not frustrating in a bad way...it's actually making me try to figure it out and learn.  The sign of a great educator. "
2019-09-25,james r,5,0,"I am very impressed with the videos, book, auto-graded tests, exercises. I have never paid $10 for a programming book before and its helpful to quickly lookup an explanation.

Thank you, professor. I couldn't have done it without your help. This course is amazing!"
2015-09-29,Corinne P,5,0,"I loved this class. It's been over 15 years since I've been exposed to programming. I alway regretted not taking the opportunity to learn it. Now I'm getting into it, and I really like it. Even with no background in programming, I did think the class moved a little too slowly though. I finished the whole thing in less than a week and even did some additional exercises. I can't wait to start the next class!"
2022-04-09,Laghavi M,5,0,"It is a good course. I know C and CPP, so I navigated through it pretty easily, English not being my native language still I understood it nicely. First few weeks were like revision for me and I focused on the differences in C and Python. And there are many new functions I learned. It was fun to learn, there are many paced assignment and quizzes which are helpful. I will definitely suggest it for everyone  
"
2021-02-05,Arzu S,5,0,"I had so much fun taking this course. Charles Russell Severance is a great teacher, even though I had my prejudice for coding, this course made it fun, and most important of all, it showed me that I can code. I went through the first couple of weeks in days! I was eager to learn. I simply wish that I was in his class. Last, of all, I like to thank everybody who worked for this course to be available here.

"
2017-09-18,Mike C,5,0,"The course comes across as too simple and a little slow at first, but it picks up during the latter half and becomes more challenging when Dr. Severans gets into function building and logic loops.  Great intro course for individuals who have very little to no programming background.  I feel like after the course, the student is well equipped to pick up a python book and start digging into greater details."
2017-06-28,Thomas B,5,0,"This is a gentle and humorous introduction to not only Python, but programming in general.  Just the way a beginner's karate class focuses on simple actions completed well (Wipe on; wipe off ;-) but eventually gives instruction in the philosophies of non-violence and inter-connectedness, so too does Chuck endeavor to get you doing something at the start of class whilst leading you to the Deeper Mysteries. "
2016-03-27,Viviana A T C,5,0,"This course has been the best programming class I have ever taken, and I have given programming several chances through multiple different courses.  The professor broke things down for someone without a programming background perfectly.  The material was taught with examples and a casual environment which enhanced my learning.  I give this course two thumbs up, cannot wait to complete the 4 course series.  "
2022-03-12,Brandi K,5,0,"Honestly, I took a computer science course in University and after 4 months of frustration found I'd learned NOTHING. I just assumed I sucked at computers and it's freaked me out ever since. This course took me 3 days to complete, and I learned so much that I actually started having fun and building the confidence to explore my own ideas of (really really simple) programs.  Fantastic resource, thank you!"
2016-12-04,Lohit,5,0,"This is an excellent course for beginners. Helping them understand that learning programming is just like learning another language to talk to strangers, computers in this case. Ample examples to help any novice to relate and appreciate the art of programming. Thanks to the whole team for freely providing such excellent coursework. Making quality education available in every nook and corner of the world."
2016-08-07,Oksana H,5,0,"The best course I've ever taken. Dr. Chuck is really cool, he is able to present material in such a way that you really start loving Python and everything seems much easier than it actually is. This course is for complete beginners. I've already finished another course on Python (from Rice University) after this one, and I must admit that the course from University of Michigan helped me a lot! Thank you!"
2016-06-24,Patrick L,5,0,"Though I've just learnt the basics of programming, I imagine learning it can be overwhelming if taught the wrong way. This course is perfectly structured as an intro to programming to allow you to learn the language without discouraging you by trying to teach you too much at once. I very much enjoyed this course. Charles Severance is excellent and engaging teacher despite the fact that he's a Slytherin."
2022-08-24,Ahindra D,5,0,"Dr.Chuck is one of the best instructors I've came across.
The Course is very beginner friendly, so this is ideal start for your journey in the world of programming.
All the concepts are discussed in depth using diagrams so it's pretty easy to grasp the theories.
The best part is the whole learning experice is FUN! You will definitely want to learn more 'n more after this.

AGAIN,  Dr.Chuck is the BEST!
 "
2021-07-06,Aytaj I,5,0,"I love this course, the professor is great, explains in a very simple way that even if you come from a different background you can grasp the topics very easily. The homework exercises are really great to fully support what you have learned. Loved the course! Would definitely continue to get the full specialization program and will recommend to friends interested in python programming and data science!"
2020-08-14,GAURAB A,5,0,"This really helped spur me on towards something that I always wanted to learn. But never had the opportunity and dedication, most importantly. I would have to thank Coursera for providing this wonderful opportunity to learn especially in this time of COVID pandemic. And special regards to Dr. Charles Severance for making such a student-friendly course. Looking forward to further specialization courses."
2020-07-26,Nour K A T,5,0,"It is the best python programming course for beginners for four reasons. First, its content is informative. Second, you will gain that bunch of information and skills in a very short time (You can complete that course in 2 days if you have the will, passion and motivation). Third, the instructor is very good person and also very professional. Last but not least, you will never get board in this coarse."
2020-05-25,Antonio R,5,0,"Very well STRUCTURED and ORGANIZED course. It is not very long too. Lectures are very useful, the professor is very friendly. Assignments are somewhat challenging and the programs you code are useful for your life. I loved the interviews with some academic and industry leaders, because I could learn what is the process to create something new and some of the things you've to deal with at the beginning."
2020-05-15,KARAN J,5,0,"LOVED THE WAY, HOW THE INSTRUCTOR WAS TEACHING US, mainly the thing which I liked the most is, before starting a new topic, he used to give us hints about that topic in the previous part, so that we just don't fear from the new topic, that topic starts looking familiar to us.....and the best part that he made me believe that python is just same as ELDER WAND, it's on us that how we try to use it.... :)"
2019-09-09,JIN B,5,0,"this course is awesome, it opened up the door of programming to me and man do I love this whole new world of knowledge and skill. Dr.'s Lecture was easy to understand and also fun to watch, with the proper amount of practicing from the assignment, as well as the quizzes that help analyze and remember the content, This MOOC here is simply so far the best introductory into Python (As well as programming) "
2018-04-20,Raluca D C,5,0,"Excellent course for those with no prior knowledge of programming or Python. Personally, I have worked with scripts for several years, but the introduction to Python was extremely useful. I completed this course in 1 day, so for those who have basic programming skills (understand statements, conditions, loops and basic programming logic) this course should be an easy short intro to the language itself."
2015-10-31,Elena C,5,0,"As a total beginner, not only in Python, but programming as well, I found this course to be extremely helpful. Slow-paced, the order of the chapters makes sense; the best Python course I've rolled in and the only one that kept me. Lots of extra material to practice on and Dr. Chuck keeps it interesting and fun, without being over-the-top. I am definitely giving a shot to the rest of the specialization."
2015-10-06,Archana V K,5,0,"I enjoyed this course.
Thank you, Mr. Charles Severance for elaborate teaching and for making the sessions interesting with all the questions asked and time given for students to pause - think and continue. Since I had prior experience in programming I found it easy to clear this course. I will be enrolling for the next course in Python offered by you.
This is my first Coursera course and I am impressed!"
2022-06-23,Mark K,5,0,"Awesome instructor.  Good level of material.  At least one mistake in the quizzes which can be annoying and frustrating (the question about exiting) -- the correct answer was never given in the course.  There were a few other spots where the material was not covered before the quiz.  This is a big fail for a learner.  I'd guess, course videos were edited or re-arranged and the quizes were not updated."
2021-12-09,Shriniwas S S,5,0,"I recently completed this course, with absolutely no prior knowledge. I must say, this course is like a blessing for those who want to learn to program but they don't have any prior experience. Dr. Chuck is a really great mentor, He explains everything so simply that a mechanical engineer like me could also understand complex things like programming easily. A lot of respect and good wishes from India.
"
2020-11-19,Irene J,5,0,"I knew nothing about Python or programming before the course. The instructor clearly wants people to learn Python -he reviews topics at a basic level, with relevant examples, quizzes and assignments. The built in tool to check assignments makes it easy to apply and test new skills. Not all the covered material makes it into assignments, however, so I hope subsequent courses will test my understanding."
2020-05-07,Shubham K,5,0,"The best possible python course available over there for beginners who are getting or wanted to get started with python. The biggest USP of this course will always be the simplicity with the Dr.Chuck has explained everything. I can't ever be thankful enough to Coursera for giving me this unique opportunity to learn from such a great instructor from the comfort of my house. Thank You So Much, Coursera!"
2020-05-06,M.Shoyeb S,5,0,"The best course on python till date to get the concepts in a relatable way that you will not forget them for a long time, Dr Chuck has gone the extra mile to make the course interactive and the assignments are very concise and make you recall and apply the learned content in the respective chapters,

i found the quiz very good as it breifs the concepts and i think it will greatly help during interviews "
2019-01-31,Jasmine D S,5,0,"As an electrical engineer, you might thing Python would be easy for me to learn. But I'm a construction engineer not a programmer so the answer was Eh, in some ways. The basic language format was clear but I had difficulty understand Python execution.  This  class reintroduced me to the basics in a way I could zoom through quickly when applicable and focus as necessary.  Definitely going to recommend. "
2016-10-14,Craig K,5,0,"
Perfect course for beginners in coding I think.  Of course, I'm not necessarily a beginner so maybe I'm biased.  However, I've never taken a computer science course and I had no issues here.  I've tried learning Python before but all I find is instruction on the syntax.  This class actually helps you use python on your own computer from the beginning.  The book and forums are both very useful as well."
2015-09-20,Sukrit G,5,0,"The instructor for this course is Charles Severance aka Dr. Chuck. & his narration/explanation is excellent; it's simple, lucid, and to-the-point. Also, you don't feel very formal taking this course, sometimes Dr. Chuck is humorous, & it helps.
A lot of work goes into making a Coursera course. 
This course can even be taught as the first programming language, and python is my first programming language."
2021-07-15,Aditya P,5,0,"Michigan has given an outstanding mentorship. Dr.Charles is dedicated to helping our up-and-coming engineers understand our engineering environment and encourages them to be solution-oriented in everything they do. Dr.Charles has also demonstrated a commitment to the professional development of his direct reports and displays enthusiasm for advancing their skill set through regular coaching sessions.


"
2018-10-25,Sankalp S,5,0,"Best thing about this course is that the instructor Charles Severance explains the concepts in a lucid manner without taking too much time and the real-world analogies makes it easier to understand everything. He sure knows how to keep his class engaged, like that sorting hat video or his 'Computer Science' jokes. The extra effort he puts in is evident from the Bonus videos at the end of every class."
2020-11-11,Marc D,5,0,"The instructor was awesome!  I entered the course with a beginner's background in C+ and proficiency in MatLab, and I found the instructor's lessons very easy to follow and to be a wealth of information.  I suspect someone with little to no programming experience would also find the course easy to follow and educational.  I will definitely be enrolling in the next course within Python for Everybody.  "
2020-04-27,Cihan,5,0,"It was a good course. Simple explanations and good examples for everyone to understand the logic of programming. Of course as you can understand from the topic of the course it is for beginners, but if you are advanced you can finish the course so much faster also.
As a conclusion i am happy what i learned from this course and will continue to dig Python for advanced courses from Michigan University."
2018-04-02,Kishan K,5,0,"good course for learning  python from beginning .its  a  course by which we who take interest in computer science . As we know , python is modern language for developing and creating ,designing a software and we also know, at present time  python plateform become larger day by day due to its simple syntex .so it is the better course for starting the learning python as secondary and primary language."
2017-01-12,Richard F,5,0,"This course is a great intro to Python, Dr Chuck Severance is an excellent presenter and takes the students on a  journey though the basics of Python at a pace to suit the individual. It builds the students knowledge incrementally through the lectures and reenforces the knowledge through targeted assignments. Having looked at a number of online courses on Python this is the best I have seen to date."
2022-01-12,Aditya R,5,0,"The 1st course in the Python for Everybody by Dr. Chuck is a really amazing start-off journey for learning Python. The way Dr. Chuck has designed this course is great and his teaching method is just an art of flow, you understand things really well like you have already known the topic before and just is brushing that dust off. This course is a must recommend for beginners and intermediates alike.
"
2017-09-02,Rowina W,5,0,"Fantastic course which I can't praise enough. I have made so many attempts at learning coding and finally I 'got' it. The course is very well thought-through, has assignments every week and the lecturer is just absolutely fantastic. Charles Severance is so engaging, understanding, and passionate and he explains concepts and tasks extremely  well. I can't wait to get started with the next course :)"
2016-12-26,Yue Z,5,0,"Really lovely professor! This is the very first Python course for me. It successfully enabled me to gain the interest of this fantastic language and get myself prepared for the further studies. I also get additional prompts from other leaners, which is valuable for me and keep me motivated. I am more than happy to learn Python now and willing to contribute to this positive and encouraging society."
2015-10-21,Francois L,5,0,"I didn't enter this course because I wanted to learn Python as such; well that too, but I would actually like to teach, mentor, inspire and influence people in a positive way.  If I can be only half as good as Dr. Chuck, I'll be a very happy man :)
When I have the financial resources, I would seriously consider doing the rest of the Python Specializations too.

Thanks

"
2022-06-08,Dr. R N,5,0,"The course was excellently designed to people like me, who have zero knowledge in coding. It is very well structured  and delivered. The course instructor ""Charles Russell Severance ""  deserves a special applause for his wonderful sessions and a take a bow. I being a professor is inspired by his way of delivery and I take a bow. He has inspired me to complete all the course in this specilisation."
2020-08-23,Kaminskaya S,5,0,"If only I had found this course when I started programming! This course is the best one for absolute beginners I have ever seen. All details are explained clearly, the teacher pays attention to many important things that are missed in other courses. I would like to recommend the course for anyone who hasn't got any experience in programming yet. Thank you Dr. Severance for the work you have done!"
2020-07-14,ELHOUSSAINE A,5,0,"Hello world!
First, thank you so much to the best instructor Dr.Chuck is so funny also. So don't worry you can laugh sometimes with learning. About the course is a very good choice for someone who doesn't know anything in programming or who wanted to start in. I like the examples for Dr.Chuck they are so easy to understand. Absolutely, I learned a lot with him. 
Thank you so much and a lot of love.
"
2020-05-20,Rohit R,5,0,"I started this course while looking to understand Python as a language because of my need to use it for my final year project. I have always loved coding but lately, the task of understanding a new language seemed insurmountable but taking this course with Doctor has helped me not only understand Python better but also helped me regain some of my previous confidence



THANK YOU DR. CHUCK



Cheers!!

"
2018-12-30,Kevin M,5,0,"Really great course for anyone looking to start their programming education with python. Perfect for beginners and honestly a decent refresher course for novices as well. Highly recommend that EVERYONE take this course, even if you don't think you have a use for Python right now, as I think it helps you explore critical thinking and a new type of learning for those without programming experience. "
2018-08-26,Zoey Z,5,0,"It's a great course for programming beginners, which gives you a basic understanding of the programming and python, and it includes pretty practical skills that can be used on daily work or studying. Besides, Prof. Severance's a really interesting person and he actually makes the coding much easier to understand and to follow by steps, as well as more attractive than it sounds! Thank you so much!  "
2020-06-11,Radha M,5,0,"I liked the course and it helped me get back to studying after a long time. Dr Chuck was a very easy going teacher and I felt connected in listening to his lectures. The assignments, quiz and the reading material complimented the teachings. I took a while to get a grip of some of the functions, loops, iterations. For a beginning it felt good to do an online course (in the current COVID pandemic)"
2017-01-15,Michelle L,5,0,This course was laid out in a very logical manner and covered all the basics for any aspiring Python developer. I'm really pleased with the breadth and depth of material that was covered. It was also presented in such a way that it was easy to understand and apply quickly. Dr. Chuck is also a great presenter who comes off very genuine in his videos and makes the longer videos very easy to watch. 
2016-09-09,Brent D,5,0,"
Content presented well.  Professor Chuck is great and feels like he's right there with you.  Very taken with his dedication and love of teaching.  It shines though and the course is wonderful.  I'm in it simply for the knowledge and it's all FREE!!!  This course should be mandatory in middle/high school.  So critical to just basic thinking and problem solving completely unrelated to programming."
2021-05-27,Darren S,5,0,"I had attempted to learn Python online previously, but I found the ""starting point"" to ""misplaced."" In this case, however, Dr. Chuck sets the stage well for a beginner and leads us through a casual, but very informative, look at the key principles and programming elements of Python appropriate for any beginner. I'm looking forward to the next courses and aiming to complete the full certificate!"
2020-10-05,Freeman T,5,0,"I've been studying their courses taught by Dr. Chuck since 2015 and I can unequivocally say that he is one of a kind — the kind that helps you really understand concepts in stuff they teach. I just wish there were more professors like him guiding students across the world in complex topics, because teaching is more than spewing out information to students, and he does great teaching. Oh my God!  "
2020-06-19,Garnet C,5,0,"  An excellent introduction to the very basics of Python (and programming in general) taught by a personable, straightforward, and encouraging professor in Dr. Severance. No previous knowledge of Python or anything programming-related is necessary, though it would certainly help you complete the course much faster if you had any prior experience. Highly recommended for Python novices of all ages.  "
2020-03-06,Mukesh B,5,0,"it was a wonderful experience on coursera to watch such a fantastic Professor like Dr. chuck and learning Python from such a great personal Human being. Thanks a lot to Dr. chuck for educating people through online platform like coursera over the world wide. This certificate will definately help me in my academic and to achieve my future goal.
Thanks to University of Michigan.
Thanks to Coursera."
2020-01-23,Allan J K E,5,0,"I printed the book and I was studying it and enjoying it on my free time. Unfortunately I was short noticed at work that my coursera subscription was going to be updated or something and that I should finish my pending courses ASAP. That made me rush on the online content but nevertheless the videos, exercises and materials online and offline are really good. Thank you very much for the course."
2018-01-23,Teshan F,5,0,"This course took my python knowledge from 0 to hero in just a few days. The teacher, THE SEVERUS SNAPE, was awesome, he's funny when he needs to be in order to keep things interesting, but he is also a great teacher, and explains everything really well. (Charles you're much better than Severus Snape). I love the course, and I recommend it to any beginner who wants to learn the basics of python. "
2016-06-14,Livia A,5,0,"The best course I have ever seen on Coursera. The teacher has patience with explaining a complicated subject, and makes it reasy to follow excercises and the textbook. This course has really brought my commitment to coursera back, after I almost competely left (this was supposed to be 'the last shot'). All beacuse of a fantastic teacher that makes learning (even the subject of programming) fun!"
2016-02-20,Vadim Y,5,0,"Absolutely EXCELLENT course for those who have never programmed or those who just want to start learning Python.  Charles Severance does a great job of fostering understanding of the core, transferable concepts of programming.  Also, this course provides ancillary information that provides a rich context for Python and programming in general.  If you want to learn programming, take this course. "
2015-10-20,Doug O,5,0,"
Dr Chuck is extremely dedicated to teaching and clarity. His personality is very welcoming and he speaks clearly and thoughtfully. Some of the 'younger' MOOC instructors need to learn this to be more effective.
I am going to try R Programming again.. but I wish John's Hopkins would take a few of Dr. Chuck's coures for inspiration on how to be more accessible.  
Thanks Dr. C!   PLEASE KEEP IT FREE"
2020-07-10,Sanjay,5,0,"Everything is just excellent about lectures, demonstrations, instructor etc. But the thing that needs correction is the autograder. It shows the same code right at one time and wrong at another time. I nearly spent 2 hours on finding what went wrong with the code and ended with the inconsistent compiling of the autograder. That's the only perk. Other than that, everything is excellent. Cheers!"
2020-06-29,carolina,5,0,"Excelent course, I tried several times to learn how to code with python (even tough im not an expert at the moment) but I always felt that the instructor assumed that i had some previous information, this case was totally the opposite, Dr. Chuck leaves no gap in knowledge and makes sure you understand (even shows us where the memory storage is and how does it looks). I want to learn much more."
2020-05-30,Utkarsh,5,0,"I am very glad by taking this course. Charles Russell is a great instructor, the way he taught is good as per the virtual learning. If he taught this well in the virtual lecture don't know how much better in the classroom. And Coursera thank you very much for this platform and the free course during this pandemic thanks a lot. Happy teaching to you and happy learning to me. Thankyou very much."
2020-05-26,Aditya R S,5,0,"  One of the best way to learn python is through this course. I love the way Dr. Chuck explains and elaborates each topic. His teaching is fantastic and he explains every topic very smoothly, the assignments and quizes conducted by them are excellent as they focus primarily on the basics. Dr. Chuck's course materials and slides are too good and gives us a lot of information. I loved this course.  "

2022-06-18,Mohammad M,5,0,"Extremely fun and engaging. I always get so bored when studying something. Even though I have taken basics in C++ language back in college, everything was quite new to me. Back then I used to hate programming. Now I am so eager to learn more and more. So much that my family are beginning to treat this course as a video game, as ""stop it, that's enough studying for today, it is time to sleep""."

2020-05-27,ashutosh y,5,0,"I had this mental restraint whenever i used to think about coding in general. But the tutor made the whole concept and idea about the coding so easy that I think i have found the new interest in Python. He just did not teach python but he also taught how in general communication between humans and computer happens, i found this very fascinating. Im looking forward for many such courses ahead."
2016-12-30,Crystal,5,0,"Professor Severance explained it very clear and the content is very helpful for a beginner who has little knowledge of Python to start. The exercise is not hard (the last one is a little challenging) 
After the first course, I feel I know more abut Python and can't wait to start the 2nd one with Professor Severance. 
I highly recommend this course for someone who wants to start to learn Python. "
2016-01-17,Craig M,5,0,"Very good. I am a 31 year old accountant and have always wanted to learn programming. I've given it a few tries before, but I always ended up confused, bored, and discouraged. This course made it very clear what I needed to know and does a great job teaching you how to implement the concepts covered. I've already started the next course, and it continues in the same fashion. Thanks Dr. Chuck!"
2020-11-01,Joshua D C,5,0,"I would absolutely recommend this course for beginners who have no experience with programming. I already had some prior experience with Python and C, so it was easy to finish. Even for someone without programming experience, though, it wouldn't be much of a problem for them, as Dr. Chuck explains the programming process using layman's terms, so it is easier for a non-programmer to get into. "
2020-08-16,Abin G,5,0,"loved it ,i'm a under grad student in cs  i was interested in python for a long time and tried a bunch of python for beginners and didn't really go through with it. Dr chuks  passion and his way of teaching kept me interested to follow through .It was a easy enough because i already had c in my first semester and i gotta say python is way more fun.I want to complete the whole specialization."
2020-06-18,Paras K,5,0,"I started this course with no prior coding experience, yet I was easily able to follow through the material. This course requires a lot of practice to master, but its worth it. The textbook is a great addition to the course, and a thorough reading of assigned chapter leads to an even better understanding of the material. I wish more courses are designed on Coursera with a companion textbook."
2020-06-09,Trunghieu 1,5,0,"Very informative, the only down side is the last exercise is a bit to hard to do. It took me one day to figure out how to do that by using dict which isn't taught in this course. All and all, nice course, really appreciate the interview with the developer of Python and some outside information about the language, it makes me both interested and relaxed when learning this course 9.5 out of 10  "
2020-05-06,Eva G,5,0,"Excelente curso para todas aquellas personas que no tienen conocimientos previos en programación. Muy entretenido y didáctico, con un grado progresivo de dificultad, pero perfectamente asumible. El instructor es un gran docente. Sabe transmitir y hacer fácil lo difícil. Sus vídeos son muy amenos.  
Lo recomiendo a quienes quieran adquirir una buena base, antes de pasar a cursos más avanzados."
2019-07-13,Kejian S,5,0,This is the most helpful starter course for people who are interested in coding and Python. I would like to say thank you to the professor and his team who streamlined the course and provided great feedback during my learning process. This course helped me understand coding and the basics of Python. I am not sure how far I will go along the coding but this is definitely a great start for me! 
2019-01-16,Max B,5,0,"Great course if you are a complete Python beginner. Helps you set up your machine and shows how to write simple scripts and execute them in terminal. Dr. Chuck is a fantastic teacher, and compared to other online courses here you will get fun lectures covering what you need on an introductory level. Also, all teaching material is available for free if one wishes to dig deeper. Two thumbs up!"
2017-07-19,Harvin M,5,0,"A really great course to start learning how to program. Dr. Chuck, as everyone calls him, makes sure all the information is easy to grasp and apply in various assignments. It's a course that builds your confidence, as I have just completed this course and feel that I can make a pretty good program. This is the course to take if you are starting to program, as this Python course does the job."
2017-03-08,Hitesh S,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is awesome. I was so bad, sooooo bad in programming that when I used to see programs, I would say to myself that Let's watch something(I can do this later). 
But thanks to Dr. C that I bought even a book on programming now and I am eager to know more about it and enjoying every bit of it. I wish and hope if I would have some teacher like you before. 
Thanks Dr. C and thanks Coursera."

and i loved doing the quiz and assignments ,the things you learn in the video , and then practically applying it really makes you grasp it deeply , The course really helps to develop your logic and creativity instead of being a boring ,lengthy , theoretical ,set of lectures , which are meant to be memorised.... great way of teaching Python ....."
2016-03-16,JB_Runnin,5,0,Excellent class! Was not a big fan of online courses; especially technical material but Dr Chuck is awesome. So engaging and he really makes the class fun. Really like the bonus videos as well as the format. Each chapter/ section broken down into small chucks so easier to digest. Small sections was also helpful if Is something was unclear and had to re-watch or re-read. Highly recommended.
2020-06-19,Ahmed A K,5,0,"This course is very helpful for those who wants to learn Python from basic. Besides, the instructor Dr.Chucks' teaching method is so helpful to understand this course easily although this was my first online course. At first I was little bit worried because of thinking that how much am I going to understand the Python but after watching few lectures I felt that I was learning comfortably.

2020-05-07,Elena K,5,0,"This course is excellent! Granted, I've learned some programming languages before so it was easy, and a good reminder of the basic elements of a programming language, but the lectures were entertaining and illustrative, the assignments were fun, and I think it's a good introduction to those who have not taken programming before. I really enjoyed the course! Looking forward to what's next!"
2020-05-07,Howard L,5,0,"Lecturer Charles is one amazing lecturer who brings joy into the world of programming. 

Prior to this course, I have been learning Python via youtube etc and find it very difficult to understand those videos on youtube. Lecturer Charles makes everything in the course easy to understand and even added in some touch of humour to make the classes more fun and entertaining. 

Highly recommended!"
2020-04-13,ALVEE J B H,5,0,Its a very good course specially for those who would like to learn programming from level zero as well as for those who has some knowledge about programming but not clear enough for him or her to continue with so therefore this course will help him or her to strengthen the basic of programming (of course in Python).Thanks to the respected instructor and thanks to coursera for the course!!
2019-09-12,Sandra M S,5,0,"The course was well laid out to build your skills in a seamless progression. Dr. Chuck presents the material in a clear and concise manner.  The material was neither too challenging, that it was ineffective, nor too easy, that it failed to get the student to make the connections needed for learning to occur. This is said for a student that has never programmed (I fall into that category). "

The course is very well designed and delivered; explanations are provided in a simplified language  that anyone can understand and imagine what is being discussed vividly.
I​t helped me understand that with due effort and discipline one can at least try to undertake some steps towards becoming a programmer. Well done, Dr. Severance and Coursera. I thank you very much."
2020-07-13,Diego L,5,0,"I have been struggling with coding for almost a year until I found this course...
Following the lead of Charles Severance and the power of Slytherin I was able to complete this course in due time! it was by no means easy but entertaining! I still have a lot to learn and practice but I must say this course is worth all of it and I will be doing all these courses made by this great teacher! "
2019-12-30,Hoyeol L,5,0,"This class really helped me to successfully start python 3. As a doctor of polymer chemisty, I have experienced MATLAB programming but I don't really know any basics or definition of the terms people using; I learned MATLAB myself with no fundamentals at all. I think PY4E is really helpful for whom need computation works, like numerical calculations, but don't know anything about python."
2019-10-28,Mayyas N,5,0,"  Even though the course is designed for people that do not know anything about programming, and I am an intermediate level programmer, I find it very enjoyable and interesting. The bonus lectures are the best. The assignments are easy and clear. But the most important thing is that the instructor ""Charles Russell Severance"" is amazing, he has a nice personality and he is very informative.  "
2022-05-17,Mah E U,5,0,"Assalam u alaikum,
My name is Mah E Urooj and my instructor of IOT course Sir Mooazam of NAVTTC recommended this course. I find this online course very educational and informative. As I am learning Python it is very helpful for me. I improved my programming skills and enjoyed learning. I enjoyed watching videos and doing quizzes. Thank you Coursera, thank you from the bottom of my heart. "
2020-05-13,Hridoy B,5,0,"  I am a Java Developer . So It was kind of very easy course for me . But for a beginner , I can say it's one of the best basic python course . Anyone with no coding background will find it useful . Professor is fantastic . Specially I loved the approach of not giving extra load . Smoothly building up . Anyone who is planning to start programming , should give it a try. Thanks coursera  .  "
2020-04-19,Samuel D C,5,0,"  I am very satisfied. This course offers a professional introduction to python programming. It includes personal experiences of the python makers and the teacher together with students around the world, a clear and well structured content including theory, explanations, examples, exercises, and tests. The teacher motivates continuously to think, to understand and apply the new knowledge.  "
2020-04-08,Tarun B,5,0,"Print(""Hello World:)"")
After trying my hands at many online courses, I found this one to be THE BEST. 
Reason: For someone like me who had no exposure to coding before this, this provided me the ultrabasic foundation. I have started to feel a little bit excited as I write code (and struggle too!). This had not happened earlier. 
Thank you, Professor Charles. You are really a great teacher!

"
2019-08-29,Theo R,5,0,"Very detailed course for who wants to understand the basis of programming. It really explains the ideas without assuming anything or jumping from a simple problem to a complex program without building the basis.. Is like being back to college, but choosing what you really want to study and at what time.. Thank you Dr. Chuck and Coursera for the opportunity.. keep up with the great work!"
2018-04-22,Vitalii U,5,0,"
Really great course! It gives excellent introduction to programming.

2018-02-07,Collen G,5,0,"The course has been tough, but good. I found Professor Charles Severance equal to the task. His presentation is excellent. I wish these courses could incorporate some practical examples before quizzes are given. This would boost students' confidence. I am promoted to the next stage of the course. I am therefore looking forward to it. Thank you 'Team Coursera, especially Prof Severance""!"
2017-06-06,Shanna L,5,0,"It was interesting and new for me to take this online course. 
I enjoy the way Dr.Charles gave the lessons.
But I still hope if there could be more exercises, like coding, that are not mandatory for us to practice.
And it will be better if there is explanation for each exercise question, which does help us to firmly review what has been taught through previous videos. 
Overall, I did enjoy!
"
2016-03-18,Tiffany D,5,0,"I have a background in music education, and wanted to dive into my husband's world so I took this course.  It has really helped me to think more like my husband.  I have started to communicate with him about his work instead of just listening intently and trying to understand on my own.  I expect the other courses to continue helping me move into his world so I can share in his passion."
2021-02-19,Murtadha K,5,0,"  This is one of the best programming courses. Prof. Dr. Charles Severance is simplifying all the Python programming way as it should be for learners with no experience or background to programming.Overall, the course presented in an excellent way to match its title ""Getting Started with Python""/ ""Python for Everybody""print ('Thanks to Coursera')

2020-08-14,Adila T S,5,0,"Super easy and broken down to the basics for absolute beginners to programming. But if you're someone  like me who's already had some basic knowledge about how programs and programming works it's going to be way easier for you and actually it might feel going a bit too slow at time.  Keeping in mind that this was made for absolute new-comers, it's all understandable and works fabulous. "
2020-06-24,Charmi N,5,0,"I am glad that to have come across this course especially because I am from a non-programming background. The instructor makes it very easy for students with no programming language to understand the concepts of Python. Considering that most the jobs today require some degree of know-how on data analytics tools, languages and software, this course is the perfect start to Journey ahead."
2020-05-26,MUNEER K,5,0,"Its a good course having simple teaching style. i found a new Teaching style in here. If any mistake is in the code, tutor will always says its not you are not suitable for programming, it is python is lost.  I really appreciate that sentence, because that is more encourage students like me. Thanks to Coursera and University of Michigan for giving me this amazing tutor and this course."
2020-08-10,Mohd N,5,0,"""This is the first time I have attended a class in this format and wondered how effective it would be. It was very effective and therefore I would definitely be interested in attending other classes in the same format. The instructor was very knowlegeable and provided a wealth of information about the current version, especially since the last version I used was several releases ago.""

2020-05-04,RESHNA S,5,0,This is a very basic course. Everyone can understand the concepts well. I have already know the programming concepts and proficiency in C++. But the amazing thing is that my high school going son has studied this and even he can understand the concepts of programming. Now he is a position to write small programs. We are moving to the second course in this section.  Thank you very much
2019-12-07,SIJIA Z,5,0,"I'm super happy that I found this course as the first course I chose to learn programming, before this course, I just believe that programming is way too hard for a girl like me to understand. 
Professor Severance really the kind of teacher who can ease your mind and teach you some amazing skills at the same time, the way he explains python really amusing and easy to understand.
Thanks. "
2019-10-14,Lien T T,5,0,"This is a very helpful course for beginners of Python. The instructor did a good job organizing the contents and explaining the concepts and code structure. I have some experience with some other programming language so the content is quite familiar, since there is lots of overlaps. However, I think people without any programming experience won't have any problem following the course."
2021-05-02,James T,5,0,"The course was very complete for the themes it went through. Though, I found it very repetitive at some point but I do not think this is big of an issue as some might find it helpful. The last thing I would add is to give more exercises. The lessons are thorough but we would need more exercises to apply what we have learnt.
Thank you very much for the past 7 weeks,
TAGUS James (France)"
2021-03-09,Poushali M,5,0,I am grateful to Prof. Charles Russell Severance. He starts from grassroot of programming and covers each topic with so simple manner it's is really easy to follow and understand every topic . I had very little amount of understanding about try and except. It just got cleared. Thanks to Coursera and Prof. Charles. Such a grate learning session it was. I enjoyed it throughout. Thanks.
2020-10-01,Nagabhushan J C,5,0,I had no clue about how python would look and feel like even though I had basic C++ experience. I would say the course is designed so well and especially Prof. Dr. Chuk explains so calmly that I could easily understand and digest it. Thank you for such a wonderful course and an instructor for introducing me to Python in such a wonderful way. A memorable introduction to Python for me.
2020-06-26,devansh u,5,0,"The instructor Dr. Charles Severance is really amazing he keeps you connected and learning. The course is very interesting and you will learn a lot.

Thankyou Coursera 
Thankyou Dr.Charles Severance "
2020-05-22,Ali M,5,0,"The course was designed perfectly for a person who is unfamiliar with any kind of programming language. The instructor has put a great effort into making things easy. With a little effort, one can create his base for python. Watch all the lectures, read chapters from the book provided, and you are good to go. Overall, the course is exciting. You will not get bored during this course."
2020-05-05,SAI J V,5,0,  On completing this course you will have a basic idea on python language. I really enjoyed taking this course. The in-between assignments will test your understanding and helps you to get the better knowledge about the language.The quizzes which are simple yet gives more fun.If you are interested in learning python language then complete this course for getting a good basic knowledge.  
2018-04-20,emily s,5,0,This course is great!!! It will teach you the beginning of python syntax but more importantly it gives you a really good foundational understanding of the concepts behind the code you are writing. Like any new language there are moments when you get stuck and it is frustrating however Professor Severance's videos and the book actually make those moments quite navigable and rewarding. 
2017-03-12,Nakendra D,5,0,Dr. Chuck's way of teaching is always wonderful. This is a second course i have taken for Dr. Chuck and i am planning to take all the courses for Python specialization. This course is very helpful for the people who want to learn Python  programming as it contains very basics of programming and designed in such a way that anyone can learn it without having any programming background. 
2017-03-04,Donald B,5,0,"Everything was good, but as seen in the forum, more explanation around how to deal with ""None"" with respect to the minimum could have been included.  Additionally, I think there have been modifications and the final assignment has changed.  Specifically on the latter, the last assignment no longer ask to compute an average but rather a maximum and minimum.  Really good class overall."
2022-05-16,Léo,5,0,"This course is very interesting and very helpful. 
Though most of points I've already known, but I can always learn something new from the instruction of Professor.

2021-09-11,Bjoern B,5,0,I​ actually knew python before taking this course. For employment purposes I'm getting some certificates on subjects I already know (but don't have any certifications or experience to show) on coursera at the moment. My emphasis is on Data Science and I found this course quite helpful to refresh my python knowledge. I would definitely also be suitable to learn python from the start. 
2020-09-21,Zaid K,5,0,my name is zaid. it was really an amazing course. i had no idea that 'Dr. CHUCK' would explain things so nicely. although i had few hiccups in graded assignments but it was overall fun. i forgot programming after my BTech from IIT (several years back). But now i again feel very enthusiastic and eager to do more and more programming.  thanks a lot coursera and thanks a lot Dr. Chuck.

I have gained such a great skill thanks to your dedication.. what a great job! Thank you !! See you on Course 2!! ;) 
2021-03-16,sertac a,5,0,It has been forever since I could actually love a course tought by a professor. Felt really great to keep up with the legendary Slytherin prof. Charles Severance!!! . His obvious talent in empathy and subtle jokes made this programing course one of my favorite moment of my day in this challenging times. Looking forward to embark new programing wonders with Coursera and Charles Sev.
2020-09-18,Roopesh R,5,0,i am very thankful to coursera and it was my first course in coursera. i loved and like the way lecture teaches to student like me and the materials which are provided are good. i never felt bore in class and i am very thankful to have lecture like Dr.Charles Russell Severance and ii wish i could have get teacher like him in future. i liked continue my remaining courses in coursera
2020-09-15,Rohit K S,5,0,I wish i had a Professor Like Chuck in my college. His Style of Teaching is Very Interactive & Unique. While taking his course i would feel Tired or Bored. Once you sit to watch his lectures you'd want to just keep going & going & test what you've learned by completing the assignments which a given after each & every topic to keep you focused throughout the course. thankyou Chuck!!
2020-05-11,Honey M,5,0,"Dr. Chuck is an amazing teacher, i am a design student, and i had no prior knowledge of programming, still i could comprehend each new topic as it was introduced by sir, almost immediately.  i recommend everyone who wants to learn python to take up this course irrespective of your academic background. all you need is your phone and an internet connection and you are ready to start."
2020-01-12,Ashish k,5,0, Dr. Chuck is so interesting that you never get bored. You can pass the course in a few days with minimum or even no programming knowledge. It's a good starting point for beginners.A great introduction to Python and programming as a whole. Everything is broken down making it easy to understand. I had zero programming experience before and this class made it easy and fun to get into.
2015-11-07,Siddharth S,5,0,"The initial topics and concepts are very well explained, which helps to build a solid foundation for learning future advanced programming techniques. Prof. Charles has taken time to elaborate on basics which can be easily grasped by complete beginners. The language and pace of course is easy and the lessons are peppered with lot of examples and video interviews of industry experts."
2020-11-04,Marco D C,5,0,This is perfect for those who have no background in python. I love the pacing and the explanation that dives deep into the topic but does not make it complex. I love how simple it is and how easy it is to follow. I love how I was able to follow without being confused with all the information being introduced. This is definitely a highly recommended lesson for starting with Python.
2020-05-25,Siqiong H,5,0,"The course is excellent and helpful for zero background people to get to know Python step by step. And I really like the instructor as he actually get you through python step by step in a easily understood way. From the first course, programming is not like something magical to me any more and I got to know how computer works in the background. Thanks a lot for the amazing course!"
2020-04-04,Irene,5,0,"I like the way that the instructor teached, very clear and straight forward while also vey humorous. I'm planning to take other classes which is relevent to python. By the way, I think this course might be a little to easy for people who have some basics for computer science or already learn other kinds of machine language. I suppose I would take more challenge classes if I known."
2019-05-18,Catherine A,5,0,"I would recommend this course highly, Charles Severance is a delightful teacher who communicates easily to non-technical people and technical alike. What I like, is I feel like I understand what I'm doing, it's not a simple 'monkey see' or 'monkey do' process that is common with a lot of online courses. Very much enjoyed doing this course and would like to continue with some more."
2015-09-17,Vladimir Z,5,0,"The only course I've actually start learning some programming. Especially good for those who don't know anything about programming and could hardly imagine how things done inside this electrical magic box.
In some sense better than Codeschool, task is a bit harder, and the overall coverage is deeper, though I passed it on 1.5x video speed because of lots of talking. Like it anyway."
2021-06-24,Manish S,5,0,"I'm feeling inconceivable, just a few weeks back I knew nothing about programming. After completing this course now I am able to help my friends with their basic programming problems. Dr.Chuck is a very great teacher Ijust want to thanks Dr.Chuck for making this course. The Best function of COURSERA is you can discuss your coding problems with other fellow students. Great course! "
2021-04-11,Khalid A,5,0,"This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material but has a lot of experience working with first-time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to, interesting, and even funny at times. Definitely recommend it for anyone with no programming background whatsoever."
2020-07-10,Steven L,5,0,"Fantastic introductory course by Dr. Chuck.  The material is very well laid out and assignments/quizzes can be tied back to material in both Coursera Videos and the course textbook.  The intro course was challenging enough to force the students to truly follow the lecture material, but also not so difficult that assignments were impossible to complete for a first time programmer."
2020-04-09,Abu S R,5,0,"This is my first course on coursera. During this pandemic, I got a mail from East Delta University that I can do some online courses offering by coursera. I didn't take a minute to enroll in some courses. Among them, I started with this course. Instructor D. Chuck is awesome in teaching. The way he teaches us is like I felt that I am doing the class in front of him in live class. "
2019-09-03,Sujeet K,5,0,"This is a great course. The teacher not only knows his material, but has a lot of experience working with first time programmers and so knows what errors they are likely to make and what questions they are likely to ask and addresses them all. He is fun to listen to, unlike some moocs I have taken where the teachers were reading and got the intonation all wrong--very distracting."
2019-04-24,Jesse C,5,0,"An excellent introduction to Python, programming, and basic control flow logic. I'm happy to receive certification for my hard work endorsed by the University of Michigan.

This course served my purpose. "
2018-06-30,Jasmine W,5,0,Instructions were easy to follow and help was easy to get. The book explained the concepts well and there was enough challenge that I felt as if I was forced to learn it. Towards the end I started skipping the videos and just reading the book to see if I understood the concepts then watched the videos as I got stuck. With some background in programming this was easy to complete.

2015-12-08,Jesse G,5,0,"
I enjoy that a very known author wrote this course. More than anything, I enjoy that the textbook is free and that the course materials are here for me to consume and learn at my pace. I also like the quizzes and the interactive checker we have for checking our code. Sometime I'm working off my phone and can't access a python interactive environment until I get home from work.z"
2021-10-10,Abdul M A,5,0,"T​his course is beyond expectations, i am from a civil engineering background had zero knowledge of programming, I just had a passion to learn and Dr. Chuck is amazing and his teaching techniques are of no match. He maskes the complex concepts easy and keeps you entertaining.
o​verall this was an amazing course. Any one with an intrest to learn programming can take this course."
2021-05-12,Vidula S,5,0,"This course made Python interesting for me, a biology student! Dr. Charles is a great teacher and it's a treat to watch him teach. Course material was basic and easy.
One thing that bugged me was in week 7, the topic was tough and somewhat rushed. The assignment was difficult as compared to the study material. 
Overall, this course is amazing and I would definitely recommend it."
2021-04-30,Marcos P P,5,0,"Considero que todo aquel interesado en aprender a programar, entender las bases y entender la lógica de la programación debería tomar este curso.

Aunque es un curso introductorio, siento que permite formar unas bases sólidas y (al menos en mi caso) motiva a seguir aprendiendo."
2021-01-26,Avanika A,5,0,Dr Chuck is a wonderful teacher and it was his demeanor that encouraged me to finish this course and make it all the way through. The course material covered basics in a very practically manner and laid foundations for understanding buggy code and exceptional behavior which is the real challenge of programming. Thank you UMich and Dr Chuck and the team for this amazing course!
2020-09-08,Siddharth S,5,0,"This was great boost for my Programming capabilities and learned a lot from Dr Chuck. He teaches very well and make concepts look more easier as they are, although i already knew about C/C++ programming i believe Coursera and Dr. Chuck made things more clearer to me. I really appreciate the time and effort he had put into this for the benefit of Thousands of student Worldwide."
2020-06-23,黄金泽,5,0,"Glad that I finally completed my first online course. I have always been interested in programming, but for personal reasons, I have been delaying learning to program. During the popularity of COVID-19, I finally put learning programming on my agenda. P4E is a perfect introductory programming course for me. I like it, so I decided to continue to follow the programming courses."
2019-02-18,Abhijit T,5,0,"Well-paced, good course for beginners. The instructor is very good. If you have absolutely no background on programming in any language, this is a great place to start. If you're an experienced professional who knows how to code, you'll find this course very easy to complete. That, however, does not take anything away from the fact that this is a good starter course on Python."
2019-01-21,Brett S,5,0,"Excellent teaching. Each night I look forward to class after a full day of work. I highly recommend Prof Severance and would also buy the book on Amazon for $10. I originally printed out the pdf version, but found it helpful to write directly in the book. The videos and book go nicely together. The homework is challenging for a complete beginner, but satisfying when completed. 

"
2017-12-27,Pedro B,5,0,Excellent teaching! At the very begin I kind of got lost on following the classes because  I continue listening on you tube one after one...  without realizing those were other chapters not cover. So on the second time getting back I didn't see the youtube classes but directly videos into cousera. A friend advised me not to keep following otherwise I would get lost again... :)  
2016-08-08,Chrysa K,5,0,"I liked the fact that the lessons are simple but to the point, and assumed no prior knowledge of anything resembling programming. Though it is of course very easy to anyone who has even limited programming knowledge, I want to say thank you for providing a friendly and non-judgemental way of teaching a programming language, an experience I did not have when I was being taught."
2021-04-09,Angus H T W,5,0,"perfect. especially learned try/except function in assignment 5.2. although try is ""The try block lets you test a block of code for errors."", but it is different from if. if is check statements, so if use ==. but try is ""do this"", so no need to use ==, just try to put a value into it and see it works or not. therefore we use num = int(num), instead of checking num == int(num)"
2020-11-22,Jessie T,5,0,Dr. Charles is very detailed in explaining the concepts and uses a beginner-friendly approach to teach python. I find the exercises after each chapter extremely helpful! The courses provide you with all the supplements you'll need so taking this course really saves the time to roam around on the Internet looking for exercises that match your level. Would recommend this class!

Especially that part about how it interprets what we are saying to the Python: blah blah blah print blah blah blah do while blah blah blah... :)) No wonder my dog looks funny at me!:)) "
2017-12-17,Mahlet Z,5,0,"Being that I was familiar with other programming languages prior to taking this course, I appreciate the quality of this introduction. I do with that this course went further into classes and larger scope programs but I'm sure that is included in the subsequent courses. So glad I had the opportunity to learn everything I did in this course. Thanks Dr. Severance and Coursera!"
2016-01-05,Robin W,5,0,"A great way to learn and from the comfort of my own home.  I am really getting a lot out of the course.  I am taking the advice of the teacher and am playing with what I have already learned.  That is making all the difference in the world to me.  It is a good idea that I am lucky enough to take advantage of, thank all of you people that have made this happen.

2018-10-02,Jan B,5,0,"My first step in becoming programmer. This curse don't teach you programming in exact meaning of this word. It teaches you syntax and general rules & how to put code together. What is more valuable is that it teaches you to think how computers think and so how to talk to them, which is in my opinion the most valuable skill you can learn in IT in general. THANK YOU Coursera!"
2018-06-07,Elaheh S,5,0,This course was the first course I took in programming. I am an MD with zero math skills. It was fantastic. It was great for my level and I'm now more confident that I can learn and use python. The lecture and the book which are free were very understandable. Dr Charles is a fantastic teacher. This is by far the greatest course I've took via Coursera. Thank you Dr. Charles. 
2018-02-16,Junwen,5,0,"  This is my first Python specializaiton course in Cousera. I am a non-programming learners, so actually I was a little nervous about I wandor if I could understand what the teacher might talk about. But as I joined in the course and watch the video materials, I become more and more relax and motivated to take this specialization. Dr. Charles was really nice and considerable.  "
2022-08-12,Lifeng D,5,0,"It was a very interesting class with a very interesting professor.

But! I would appreciate a bit more help during some assignments. 
I'm sure the staff is doing the best it can, but when you pay, you expect something small back. The certificate is really not the issue here, it's the knowledge.
Besides that, the course is amazing. Couldn't have asked for a better entrance to the world of programming. "
2020-05-01,Anthony,5,0,"The content of the first course is basic, I know that it ignores some complicated concepts so new beginners can get through Python quickly. I think this course is friendly for new learners and helpful for me because I can get into other courses as quickly as I can.
 Thanks! The concepts contained in this class is easy to understand, and I will recommend it to my classmates"
2017-11-12,Noelle M,5,0,"Great introduction to Python from a knowledgeable instructor who moves through the material at the right pace to maintain ones attention and interest.

having used programming skills at all in my work. I have to say that it has
been a very pleasant surprise. The course is very well taught and even for
non-programmers like me it offers a very easy-going and efficient learning
experience. Kudos to Dr. Chuck and the rest of the team that made this
possible."
2020-10-14,Mayank R,5,0,"I took this course back in 2015 with pretty much zero understanding of python and computer programming. Five years later, I have changed my career from core finance to quantitative finance requiring significant programming skills. This course was where this all started. Excellent introduction to Python and computer programming in general. Thank you Professor Chuck."
2020-07-15,Rohan C,5,0,"Was an amazing experience learning this course. I must say that everyone should learn programming. I was not sure initially when I took the course, but when I started learning the course, I got more understanding. I used to get stuck at some exercise, but  Dr. Chuck instructed very easily for every class, which made me learn more from the course. Thanks, Professor."
2018-01-28,Jeff A,5,0,"Absolutely outstanding course. Really liked the lectures, the examples, and the exercises. It's been much easier to learn Python through this course than simply reading a book and doing exercises. Charles Severance's explanations really make the language much more understandable.

2020-05-10,Huzaifa I,5,0,"Great course for beginners. One can easily do it if he/she doesn't have a programming background. The instructor is good and explains well.
The only thing in my opinion which can be improved is instead of teaching from slides, the instructor should write the programs on his PC and share the screen recording and explain form there. 
Overall great experience.

2016-12-14,Mohd A T,5,0,"Great course to start with if you are new to programming. Dr. Charles Severance introduces programming in a unique way which was entirely different of how i was taught during my college. His emphasis are more dependent on how the system thinks rather how we think. Although, its just minor shift teaching ideology but this has huge psychological benefits."
2022-01-10,Robert S,5,0,"T​he textbook, lectures, and activities align really well. I felt like the coursework allowed me to have multiple repetitions with similar content so I was able to remember and apply new learning. Assignments were doable, but also posed some unique challenges, which I think helped me dive in and actually practice rather than spit out memorized content."
2020-12-20,Muhammad W,5,0,"As someone who studied programming at college, I was very confused with the control statements and indentation in Python.

And I 'm  really glad that I finally complete all the study goals."
2017-08-30,Nicholas J,5,0,"A worthwhile introduction. The bonus videos were not helpful. The final assignment video of using Atom did not match well with the rest of the introduction and playground setting of the course. I am not sure how to fix it, but I think it would be beneficial if introductory students submitted python files created by Atom or a similar file editor. "
2016-10-10,Ricardo D,5,0,"Great , even for a non native english person , is easy to understand the Dr. Charles Severance. Had some struggles during the homeworks, cause i didnt understand exactly how they want me to do it , did it first in some way , got same answer but not same process , so that was the hard part for non native english person, besides that it was great."

 "
2021-01-26,Scuola F,5,0,"Exceptionally clear, entertaining, and useful. Even though some exercises are not always straightforward, they are extremely well planned. So, for anybody who will go to face them, don't assume they are misplanned. The course achieves its mission. Finally, I would recommend using some interface different from Atom, which is not very intuitive."
2020-11-13,Jereme C,5,0,"I wish they taught like this back in college. Anyway this is where I learned python 3 years and was able to use it on my work.

Thanks to Coursera for providing such a good e-learning platform.
2021-03-29,Veronica H,5,0,"I love how Dr. Severance explained the structure of Python language. This is my second time learning Python basics because even though I practiced a lot, I didn't understand the logic of Python during my first time. This course helped me understand the importance of getting ""grammar"" right for learning any languages (including coding)."
2020-07-23,Nizamuddin S,5,0,"Even a person, who knows nothing about computers or programming, can easily understand and learn programming and that too in Python, today's very popular and useful computer language.  And, that too, at our own pace.  Further, the teaching by Dr Charles Reverence, Ph D, is so lucid that learning becomes very easy and fast and accurate.  "
2020-04-16,MD. M S,5,0,I have tried many online courses but always felt bored and gave up.

I appreciate how it starts from the basics and goes through installing Python, best practices when writing programs, etc. I find the getting started part of programming can be intimidating, but this made it much easier to start (and hopefully stick with!)."
2020-06-17,Kah H K,5,0,"For a one-directional learning, Charles did a great job keeping my engage. The discussion/forum is very active which is perfect for my learning when I have problems. I have tried learning python from different channels and this is by far the best. Thank you so much. I really feel that I learned a lot and motivate to continue learning! "
2020-06-04,Rose S,5,0,"I was familiar with python before this course and wanted to touch up on it. I found myself leaning new information that I didn't know before, and finding new ways to think about programming. Professor Severance is entertaining and motivates me to learn more. Great course, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn how to program."
2020-06-01,Deeksha S,5,0," All those who had given 1 or 2 stars to this course,are the ones who always criticize everyone.This course is seriously quite amazing and everyone thinking of starting with python should go for it.DO NOT FALL FOR THOSE NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND REVIEWS. The instructor is very good and explains everything so beautifully. Hope this helps :)"
2020-04-21,Aayush S,5,0,  The course is very well structured to suit the needs of a new programmer (me) who is trying to learn python from the very scratch. Prof Charles keeps the video lectures engaging and the assignments help get a grip on how to actually put them those learnings in a code. Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn python from the basics  
2020-04-01,Hernan F L,5,0,"This course is excelent, i learned a lot and will continue to navigate through the whole program.
Thanks to everybody who made it, and made it free access as well. Your work is much appreciated!
I'll try to help with the translation to spanish so other people in South America can do it as well. 
Thank you again from Argentina! Much love!"
2019-12-16,MANEESH V S,5,0,"The Teaching technique adopted by the Trainer was extremely helpful in adapting and absorbing the new programming language. The day to day and simple examples adapted in the said program to explain the new language really proved the name of the course-""PROGRAMMING FOR EVERYBODY "". It was an amazing introduction to the WORLD OF PYTHON."
2019-11-24,Anran W,5,0,"This course is every useful and easy to understand for beginners. I really have no idea what python and any other programming languages are before I started this course. Also English is not my first language. However I could understand this course very well, the practices in this course are very effective! Thanks a lot for helping me!"
2019-11-08,Frednand F,5,0,"The best course for everyone even those who lack background in programming like myself. I recommend everyone to take this course. In today's world it feels like you are walking naked without knowing how to code even basic programming. That was internal thrust for me to do this course.



Go for it, it worth your time and money. Thanks !

"
2019-08-30,Abigail J,5,0,"This was an excellent course. Dr. Chuck is engaging, clear, and moves at a perfect pace. The course has helpful assignments, quizzes that actually assess comprehension, and plenty of opportunities for practice. As a 24-year-old who has never done any coding before, I cannot recommend this class highly enough. Truly a great experience."
2018-02-04,Aamir R,5,0,This course has helped me a lot in having the correct understanding of programming language. The mode of teaching is not only erudite but also simplified for a non computer science student which doesn't have any background in programming. At the end of this course one can have the necessary skills and logic to think like a programmer.
2017-05-29,Janarthanan  R,5,0,"I would like to register here that Dr.chuck is the man, i would ever refer to any one who needs to learn Python programming. He is efficient, knowledgeable and friendly, and regarding the course material, i do not know, if it can be any better.

2016-04-23,Karan B,5,0,"The pace of this course & the course content, along with the Creative Commons material is fabulous for anyone who has no prior experience in programming. Prof. Severance is great at what he does, and the assignments are also brilliant. I wished there were more peer review assignments or more assignments so that we could practice more. "
2021-01-29,ANUBHAV G,5,0,Dr. Chuck is now my favourite professor on an online learning platform. His way is teaching is just awesome and he always focusses to teach the complicated topics in the easiest way possible. I really want to thank COURSERA for giving me this opportunities to learn some new technologies under the guidance of such a wonderful teacher.
2020-08-30,Pravin R D,5,0,"I am very thankful to course tutor Dr. Chuck and University of Michigan for providing such a useful course. I have tried programming for first time and I can say that I too can creatively and confidently write useful codes, this is just because of teachings of Dr. Chuck. I will definitely enroll for further courses too, Thanks again!  "
2020-08-03,Md A,5,0,"I have heard from people that python is not easy. But this course has completely changed my perspective, because the instructor has made the programming language so easy, that it can be understood even by a person who never had learned any programming before. I look forward to complete all the 5 courses in this module. Thanks a lot ."
2020-07-08,Shivansh S,5,0,It is a course for everybody if don't have any prior knowledge about programming even then Mr. Severance will make it very simple for you to understand the logic behind the code and also will help to understand the flow chart of code i.e how the code will starts and how it will work. One of the finest courses I have ever enrolled in.
2017-08-02,Sergio B,5,0,"A great base for first-time programmers. Users with experience in other languages might find this somewhat tedious and repetitive at certain points. Although, you can skip the repeated parts. As for Charles, the professor, I find him to be a great teacher. He's good at Python, he's good at teaching Python, and he clearly enjoys both. "
2017-07-04,Stephen J,5,0,"It's a great course. I'm actually going to recommend it to at least five separate people. He was intelligent, highly structured/organized, and went over things multiple times to ensure implant/imprint. The quizzes and assignments would have been difficult, but not unbearable without prior coding experience. Overall, very good course."
2017-02-04,adarsh k s,5,0,dr.chuck you are awesome!!really i started learning python from many books but after sometime i find it boring and leave it there but in your class i never feeled that you are boring me..really your class is awesome i will suggest everyone to take class of dr chuck..and one more your way of explaining the things is perfect..thank you 
2020-11-09,18UCH020 A P,5,0,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT COURSE ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE BEST GUIDANCE AND LUCID EXPLANATION BY DR. CHARLES SEVERENCE.

HE IS REALLY ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS I HAVE EVER ATTENDED.  "
2020-03-18,Bilal T,5,0,"Excellent instructor, through out the course I did not get bored while learning Python and always had my thinking caps on. This course helped me gain my confidence back  programming, so much so I have started to teach Python to 5 of my colleagues. I will be looking forward to complete all the other courses of this series as well. :) "
2019-08-06,Paisley G,5,0,"This was a great introduction to Python and the overall workflow of logically figuring out problems, identifying what pieces of code are needed to do X task, and so on. The videos were super helpful and easy to understand (even for someone who hasn't been in school for like 10 years), and I feel confident going into the next module. "
2019-02-01,Kleo,5,0,"Lightweight, but if you're an absolute beginner, this is the course for you. Great teacher, the resources are a necessity if you want to get the most out of the class (100%), and the lessons are of limited topic, all making this the best (imo) introduction to programming for anyone. Do this first, before other free coding resources."
2018-08-05,Rohit S,5,0,My first ever online course and i loved it so much! Dr. Chuck is a genius in the way he takes students into the Python programming with so ease and perfection like Python is nothing new  and is always comfortable to go through his lectures and bonus material available at each chapter. I highly recommend it to any beginner in Python!
2018-07-13,Abhishek N,5,0,"This is an ideal course for Python learners. It's easier and faster to learn if you already have experience in programming, but it's also fluid to first time programmers with many examples and experienced tips. The tutor is well experienced and his teaching is very student-friendly. It's so nice and easy to connect and learn easily."
2018-04-19,Soh W K,5,0,"This course is absolutely good for anyone without Programming Skills, or have no prior knowledge to what is a programming basics. Dr. Chuck will be able to guide you from not knowing programming to a very solid foundation in your FIRST programming language studies.
However, this course is not suited for Intermediate - Advanced level. "
2015-11-16,Amy G,5,0,"I have tried other open course sites for learning Python and found this one the best.

structured logically with helpful quizzes. I experienced the videos in
combination with the study book as the best learning method."
2020-09-12,Ahmad A,5,0,"  Nice course for beginners and people who want to try python out in general, it teaches you essential information from scratch, some courses start from reserved keywords and all those boring things directly but this one, teaches you what it means to program, and I like that and would recommend it to anyone interested in programming.  "
2020-08-25,Jyoti T,5,0,"Sir, Charles  Severance, I'm really grateful to you. This was my first online course & because of you, it made me so easy & understandable.

What a great teacher What a valuable course, I just wanna say thanks for putting out such great materials. It 's just the very beginning for sure but I'm enjoying it. "
2020-06-25,Alison S,5,0,"I tried a Java class before and had a hard time staying motivated. Hard to say exactly what factors contributed to that , but didn't get that with this class. I liked the start from zero approach while still moving along at a decent pace. Dr. Chuck explains everything quite well so I never ended up feeling like I missed something."
2020-06-17,Shashvita M,5,0,"Till you start the course you may be in a dilemma whether programming is your cup of tea or not, but after starting this course you'll gain confidence.

I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to start learning python or even programming in general "
2020-02-27,Arjun P,5,0,"Incredible course. I started with absolutely zero knowledge of Python (of course I heard of it before but I had never actually studied it or worked with it). It took me 4 weeks to complete and at this point I feel like I am developing a strong foundation with which to continue my studies.

I highly recommend this course to everyone!"
2019-10-24,Kirk D B,5,0,"Please view the HTML doc in 'resources' after every week, it helps out. His teaching speed is very concise, comfortable, and not too fast. He didn't mention all the types of functions and such, but I suspect, he has good reason too. It is a great intro. I enjoyed it. Also, downloading sololearn is a good compliment to this course."
2017-09-15,João A L,5,0,"This professor is just amazing. I just wish those tests and exercises were more difficult, but I totally understand why they are simple in the beginning. Hopefully things will get more interesting later on, since I have already learned C and C++, the beggining seems a little too slow for me. Other than that, 10/10 course for sure."
2016-01-31,Reagan C,5,0,Dr. Severance is a great professor. The method he uses to introduce Python is great for someone who has no prior coding experience.

I would highly recommend this class as a starting point if you want to learn programming. 
2021-07-17,Brent A,5,0,"I had no background in programming and I am a slow learner. But the way Dr. Chuck explains makes it so easy. Just a tip for other slow learners out there, while Dr. Chuck is explaining, stop the video, read through the example till you understand it, then see if you can write the program on your own without looking at the answer."
2020-09-12,Leslie C G,5,0,"Course was well delivered and well explained.  It was easy to refer to lectures for assignments that were due. I liked that it catered to people that have never programmed before, and those that have been exposed to some programming alike.  I was surprised by how much I learned and how fast the 7 weeks went by - highly recommend."
2020-08-02,SWARNENDU D,5,0,"I have previously a bit accustmed with the programming with C++, but learning the basics of Python from Prof. Charles Russell Severance it was a great experience.

2020-04-16,Oliver C,5,0,"This is an excellent
course for someone getting started with programming. The videos are clear and
the subject is well described, and the textbook for the course is free. The ratio
of videos to exercises is good. If you know another programming language, the course
is a bit slow, but… the title did say “Programming for Everyone”. "
2020-04-08,Navneeth V,5,0,Really great class. Dr. Chuck is a great teacher and covered all the areas where studets might have doubts. He was really thinking from the students' side and thought what all doubts could arise and cleared it very well. It was a really great experience.

2020-04-09,ABU S,5,0,It was a beautiful course and Sir Charles is one of the most beautiful and humble teachers i have ever seen in my life.I really am in a great sorrow that I didn't get his class in person and I'd love to get one.I look forward to all the courses that are offered by University of Michigan and Charles.I loved this course honestly.
2018-05-02,Harshil P,5,0,"  It had been a great experience learning the basics of python via this class. The teaching is good and very easy for even a beginner to understand without any difficulty. I would suggest anyone who wants to learn basics of python, go for it. The teacher knows his materials and teaches in a friendly and easily understandable way.  "
2018-02-18,Gabriel O,5,0,"Great course, excelent and simple explanations.
I'm familiar with most of the stuff here from other programming languages, but the course was more than able of pointing those small details that make python syntax different from others.
Thank you Mr. Severance for this introduction into python, made in a simple and concise manner."
2017-08-27,Aditya D,5,0,Professor Charles explains the subject at hand in detail while making sure that students aren't overwhelmed by the vastness of the computer language. The assignments are a tad bit easier than I would have hoped but the videos and quiz are more than thorough. Resources provided are great and it has been a good experience so far.
2015-10-12,Miki S,5,0,"Clear and concise introduction to python basics. For beginners, just be aware that this course will not enable you to program in Python well enough for most real-world applications. If you really want to learn Python, take the rest of the courses offered through the specialization to understand how to utilize the language well. "
2015-10-04,Himanshu M,5,0,"Really liked the way Mr. Severance approaches the problem and his methods of teaching. He is by far the goofiest teacher on coursera which is unique in a way and also desirable I think. He makes learning fun.
Great Job. All the best for future courses. Will surely want to take another course on python taught by Mr. Severance. :) "
2021-06-25,Sean G P V,5,0,As I chose to study Python in Coursera I gladly chose University of Michigan. The overall experience and journey is very enjoyable while at the same time very informative. A must choose course and university! I studied this course for fun and I learned a lot. I think I really did great and passed the course with flying colors.
2020-09-08,Mario E,5,0,"Actually, this my first Coursera course to ever take, I had zero Python experience, but this is a great introduction to Python and, without any doubt, it motivates me to delve deeper and learn more about Python. Finally, great thanks to Dr. Chuck and all whoever supports these courses, you really made it special and different."
2020-07-04,Emanuel B d C,5,0,"It is a really good course, I've learned a lot about python programming, and you don't need to be a english fluenty speaker to  get in this course, actually I have improved my skills in English while I was watching the classes and reading the extra lectures material, I really recommend this course, Thank you all from Coursera! "
2020-05-31,Karina F,5,0,"This was my first programming course that I've ever taken. I was happy to find that the pace of the course allowed me to also focus on my full time job, and the instructor had such a down to earth way of teaching. I've enrolled in the specialization associated with this course and look forward to completing the next 4 courses!"
2020-03-19,Chris R,5,0,"This class was absolutely fantastic.  I highly recommend it for the person who wants to pursue this field, the person who has a general interest and wants to see if they would like it, or the person who just wants a basic understanding to start exploring on their own.  I can't wait to continue the progression of these courses."
2019-09-03,Rodrigo P,5,0,"The professor is super easy to follow and the class is very easy to understand for all backgrounds. This is a very basic course, so if you have coded in other languages before, you're going to breeze through the course. Having said that, it is a good course to learn the basic syntax to do loops, functions, ifs, etc. in Python."
2018-12-29,Alan,5,0,"This course is both comprehensible and well-organized. The instructor is so nice that I had a great time enjoying the videos. There is only one problem which is actually not particularly attributed to this course. The coursera website sometimes got so hard for my browser to open, so I had to download the videos when it worked."
2018-02-16,Filippo P,5,0,"I like this course a lot, i understand it's an entry level course so i don't mind going though everything in detail, but as i was already confident in C and Matlab i had to skip most of the basic explanations of how computer works and basic understanding of what programming is. The teacher is very good and very easy to follow."
2018-01-08,Luke O,5,0,"Very good class. I had previous programming experience in other languages, and this class helps you get the basics going very quickly with Python. I really appreciate the recommendation of the text editor ""Atom"" as well. I think it's important to be using something that is supported by the class, as opposed to your own editor."
2017-08-05,Arjun B,5,0,"I am completely satisfied with the course. I think that I have built a strong foundation for Python Programming. I fully enjoyed every single bit of the lectures by Dr. Chuck, quiz and assignments at the end of chapters. Auto-grading system is yet another big advantage.
Thank you Dr. Chuk, University of Michigan and Coursera!!!"
2017-01-12,Hyo J,5,0,"I reviewed in korean for korean mooc learner.
전 이 강의를 통해 파이썬을 처음 접하고 있습니다. 이 강의에서 제공하는 교재와 더불어 출판된 한글 교재(따로 적지 않습니다.)로 같이 공부하고 있습니다. 한국에서 출판하는 일반적인 교재와 다른 구성이 개인적으로 마음에 들었구요, 다른 교재에서 본 적이 없는 몇몇 코드도 신선했습니다. 전체적인 강의 레벨도 아직은 초급에 맞추어져 있어서 공부하기 좋았습니다. 강의하는 Dr. Chuck의 설명도 쉽고 명쾌하여 초심자로서도 크게 부담없이 강의를 들을 수 있었습니다. 영어도 크게 부담 없을 것이라 생각합니다. "
2016-12-01,Derek H,5,0,"Really good intro into the Python language. Seems simple enough for students that have never programmed or scripted before. Very descriptive and helpful lessons along with interesting bonus material.
Can be kind of slow or simple for students with a background in programming but a nice reintroduction if you are out of practice."
2016-03-01,Weizhe T,5,0,"very good course for beginners.

and I would like to put some suggestions:
1. might be worthy discussing a little about type conversion samples like: x=  ""1""; x = int(x);
2. for HW 5.2, if user put floating number, it will pass the try, but actually we need to output integer. which is easy to fix but might cause frustration

thanks!"
2021-12-31,Ryan S,5,0,"I have experience programming in a few languages including Python, so I found much of the course do be review for me. I did learn some new things though and I like the way he teaches. I've only used online Python tutorials before, so it was nice to have a better structured course. I plan on continuing with his Python courses.

"
2021-09-13,Jairo S F,5,0,I consider this course a great and meaningful way to start programming with Python. Each and every week the classes and exercises were quite useful and didactic.

2021-02-07,Tokom N,5,0,"This course is easy to understand. Instructor Charles has put his great effort to make this course one of the best among online python courses and he has made the course for everybody to understand. The course can get even better if the assignment's descriptions are written in easier to understand English, however, It's okay.  "
2020-12-15,Ahmad D,5,0,"Excellent course, i recommend everyone who's interested in programming and never tried it before, to start with this course, the pace of this course is just perfect not too slow and boring and not too fast, you will finish this course equipped with both confidence and skills to move forward in the programming world. Thank you"
2020-10-17,Kaushik N A K,5,0,"The course is very simple to follow and provides an in-depth explanation for every concept.
Even though I am not a beginner in programming, this is the first time I am learning Python, and it made things so much simpler to follow. 
All the tests reinforced my learning as well! So thanks a lot for this course, Dr.Chuck and team!"
2020-08-16,Yi Y,5,0,"My background: I have learned Language C before. But I didn't use it at all after that. Then this year, I learned Python by my self for a month.  But I can't continue because it's beyond my understanding.  So I learned it through Coursera now.  What Dr. Severance taught is easy-understanding, it's very good for the beginners."
2019-06-28,srinivas c,5,0,"Excellent course I really enjoyed learning python and it gave me a different dimension to the course the quality teaching provided,excellent faculties and assignments gave me an ability to think how to solve problems easily able to grasp whatever concepts I understood and able to apply.So feels great to be part of this course"

 Thank you Dr Chuck, your explanation and classes are very helpful, detailed and beautifully assembled. I love coding!
Thank you University of Michigan!
Thanks!!! :D"
2016-01-04,Ioannis K,5,0,"A nice course.
Indeed it was kinda easy for people with some background in programming like me, but I think it is the way it should be for people with no experience. In my opinion people with no programming knowledge at all could use this course to start learning programming without having to study anything else before that."
2015-10-24,Zhisong H,5,0,"
Very suitable for new comers of programming. For me who has programming experience for more than 10 years and just want to catch up with the mainstream of programming in Python, it's a bit too simple. But that's my problem, not the class. The class is arranged nicely, Chunk presented very well and clear. I like it very much


"
2021-12-05,JANHVI A,5,0," I enjoyed learning from Sir, Charles Severance. I thank him and Coursera for this useful, informative and illuminating course. He is a very thoughtful teacher who puts a lot of thought into how he presents the material. His lessons were useful.
I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning.

Thank You!
"
2020-12-16,John J T,5,0,"Superb! I think Mr. Charles is my ideal teacher. Haha. He explained the topics easiest way possible that it became easy for me to understand. He connects the lesson to real life experience which makes it more interesting and more understandable. Thank you Mr. Charles! Thank you, University of Michigan! Thank you, Coursera! "
2020-11-16,Tobias P,5,0,"A very nice introduction to the language of Python, instead of dragging you through the rough topics at first - You're instead introduced to some of the cool functions Python has. The icing on the cake is definitely the bonus section - You can feel the instructor is very committed to this and has a passion for the subject."
2020-06-24,Pan C,5,0,"I strongly recommend this course to everyone who didn't learn anything about programming before. Actually I have learned C language 8 years before but I don't think I understand programming. However this time I can realize why I should code like that. Dr. Severance's class is funny and vivid, it's worth to take this class."
2020-05-21,Aman K,5,0,It's a really simple course for beginners and really encouraging one. I had learnt Ocaml programming in my college first year but never learnt how thing worked there and wasn't able to visualize what actually was happening there. With this course I am able to visualize what each line is doing and how every loop is working. 
2020-05-06,Onkar G,5,0,"Great course for any kind of demographic, be it a professional programmer seeking to add another language to their skill set or someone from a non technical background who have never coded in their lives. This course is beneficial to anyone who wants to start learning python. Great experience learning from a great teacher!"
2019-12-27,DC,5,0,"This is a good course if you are new to python or programming in general. The explanations for the course material is fine. However, some of the wording for the practice assignments could be worded better. I did not use the forums much, but I did see that the teaching assistant replied to other students in a timely manner."
2018-04-04,Sourabh K,5,0,"Very well planned course, nicely divided into weeks. Helped me get started with Python. The instructor is good. Its like your personal tutor :). Moreover Not just theory but also those practical quizzes and exercises helped me get my hands dirty with coding too . I am looking forward for more such courses and certificates. "
2016-02-20,Kyle T,5,0,"Charles Severence is amazing at what he does, his method of teaching is second to none.  you remind me of my physics teacher back at high school he was very unorthodox in his teaching also.  so glad to see the course has gone to include all the material from his phenomenal book.  Thank you and well done snape youre awesome"
2016-01-23,Raj K,5,0,Basic python stuff covered. Useful for someone coming in with no real programming exposure. And a good revision for someone picking up programming after a gap. Dr.Chuck's style is easy and engaging to follow.  Note that this course covers only first five chapters of the python book.  Rest is covered as part of paid course.
2015-11-07,Deleted A,5,0,"Excellent introductory course for programming! Chuck really did a fantastic job ""rewiring"" my brain so that now I begin to think about everything in a linear way, like a machine...For an absolute beginner, Python is much more accessible than Javascript. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to get a taste of programming!"
2021-05-23,Хейтер 2,5,0,"Думал, что курс будет немного более продвинутым. Я уже всё это знал, поэтому видео и другие теоретические материалы особо не изучал - просто выполнял задания) Но для совсем новых людей в программировании - это очень хороший вариант понять принцип самого программирования и программирования на Python в частности. Спасибо :)"
2020-11-09,Paulo A,5,0,"Este curso é maravilhoso. Eu já havia feito alguns cursos fora do coursera e havia aprendido bastante,mas era mais pra prática do realmente entender a fundo. Tanto que quando comecei,tinham detalhes sobre coisas básicas que eu não sabia que acontecia. Eu sabia fazer mas não sabia como funcionava . Então,este curso é ótimo"
2020-04-14,Dwight B,5,0,This was an excellent easy-to-follow introduction to programming and Python.  Course materials were well organized and presentations easy to understand.  Materials and explanations were very relevant.  Exercises presented good challenges and were appropriate to previous and current teachings.  So glad I took this course!!
2020-02-03,Marija L,5,0,"I really liked the style of professor Chuck, not a second of his talk is boring or irrelevant. I would suggest adding at the very beginning some very basics, like (non-)importance of using spaces in Py, use of colon and brackets. And also, the perspectives of working with Python - what is it that we will use it to create! "
2019-09-16,HUAN Y,5,0,This is a great course and it's truly a program for EVERYBODY.I And Dr.Chuck  is very knowledgeable and very humorous in class style. This course provides a lot of useful learning materials to make this course easier to learn and operate. I think I would highly recommend this course to my friends who want to learn Python.
2021-08-05,Tania G,5,0,"I am a beginner with no degree in  IT whatever and yet I enjoyed very much the course as Dr Chuck made it possible for me to undestand it as he has very good explanatory skills and the computing conversations were really amazing because through them, I realized even more things. I would strongly recommend it to everyone!"
2021-07-14,Carlos A,5,0,This is a very interesting course and I recommend it for begginers. I'm a 40y old mechanical engineer and I studied Q-Basic and C++ 20 years ago at university and the basis of programmation was very useful for this course. I think that anybody that haven't seen python could take the course with a bit of practice in Atom.
2021-04-18,Samuel B,5,0,"I have a background with programming in MATLAB, but obviously, Python differs from that, so I wanted to leave a review to express how well Professor Severance describes the concepts I already knew, and how well he was able to explain why things are a certain way in the Python language. Looking forward to the next course!"
2020-12-17,Zhifen W,5,0,"Good starter course for computer programming. For those who have some programming experience, this course is easy to refresh some programming basics; For those who don't have programming experience, this course is a good starter course as it is built to teach the content in a smooth and approachable way., easy to follow."
2020-08-14,Harika D,5,0,"I really liked the way the professor had taught us. I was beginner to coding before the start of this course. Few of my friends had scared me that coding is the most difficult of all. But, during the period of this course I haven't felt scared at all but additionally I was so excited to complete the whole specialization. "
2020-07-02,Daniel V,5,0,"Wonderful, I am getting to do this thru the grant from Minnesota Economic development.   Easy to understand and work with.    I guess the only thing that would be nice (that I have gotten use to thru udemy courses) is a optional followup video on the assignment that just walks thru why everything works the way it should. "
2020-04-24,Bhimavarapu I R ,5,0,"This course is Awesome, it helped me to explore more and also the assignments are good and more over this course also gives u the industry explosure , thanks for giving oppurnity to learn thank you coursera and also thank you to my lovely python instructor, i will meet u one day in real life and i will take your blessing "
2019-03-14,Ajinkya K,5,0,"A very well arranged, well taught and well assessed course about basics of Programming with python. tutor teaches it with ease and assignments test your knowledge of course material.

2018-04-01,DIPJYOTI B,5,0,Excellent course for a beginner with absolutely no background in computer programming languages or coding in general. This course has really given me the confidence to go for more advanced level of Python. I absolutely loved the video sessions by the instructor. It felt like i'm physically attending his class. Thank you.
2017-05-09,Letania F,5,0,This course is an excellent resource for true beginners. Charles Severance has this amazing way to explain things that helped make the shift from thinking that computers are super-smart and I am just not smart enough to understand them. After this course I think that I am smart and computers are dumb. Highly recommended!
2017-01-16,Mika A,5,0,"This course is an absolute must for everyone wishing to get a good start in programming. Everything: from the quality of materials to the charm of Mr. Severance makes you want to return to the course and view another lecture, learn something new or succesfully complete another assignment.

No, literally, that is supercool!"
2021-11-05,Nilesh B,5,0,First of all I want to thank coursera for making this wonderful course available to all of us who wanted to learn python basics .  I would also like to thank Charles Severance and his team for their time and handwork that they put into this course . Truly they did a very nice work . Keep it going . Keep helping people .
2020-06-28,Shane M,5,0,"A very well taught intro to python and programming. I am a relatively experienced programmer in other languages, and am trying to get better with python with the python specialization. I found this course to be well taught and accessible. A bit too easy for someone with experience, however still great to pick up syntax."
2020-05-02,Kushal B,5,0,Great first step to start of with introduction with a new language which for non-technical people like myself used to feel like rocket science. The instructor Dr. Charles is brilliant and there isnt a false moment in his teaching. It felt like taking one on one lectures. Looking forward to completing the specialization.
2020-04-18,Thomas S,5,0,"This course starts out with the real basics which makes it approachable for someone new to programming.  If you already have experience programming, you can move through the material in a matter of hours - so it becomes a good refresher but doesn't consume too much of your time.  Nice job!  Keep up the quality courses!!"
2019-01-11,David K,5,0,"Great course and interesting materials and assignments. But I have previous skills in other programming languages , so some tasks were not so hard to pass. Professor is great in teaching and explaining important and complex concepts in easy and funny way. I will recommend this course to beginners and intermediate users."
2018-01-29,Spencer,5,0,This is hands down best class I have taken through coursera. So well thought out. Prof does a great job presenting the materials in an order that allows the learner to build a start to finish understanding of the material that leaves you with knowledge that can be applied not just memorization of a programming language.
2017-10-15,Matthew A,5,0,"Good intro to Python. And to programming in general.
One problem is that quizzes lock after you complete the course. Obviously, changing results after the end of the course is undesirable, but the ability to look through tests at at later date would be nice. I think this is a Coursera problem though, not course-specific."
2016-10-26,Harish,5,0,Great course for anyone who is new to computer programming and wants to learn Python. This course covers Python 2.XX version which is good. For folks who already know other programming languages; you might want to consider other advanced Python courses or opt for advanced Python courses by Prof. Severance. Great Teacher
2022-05-31,Bassel A,5,0,"Thank you for the course, it was very informative and the teaching methods were very understandable and easy to handle, although I had no prior experience in programming so i have literally started from scratch, but I found myself able to deal with the assignments and understanding the different topics of the language! "
2020-11-19,shubham k,5,0,Amazing course...Learnt the basics of python programming. The instructor seemed to have good experience in programming field and had vast knowledge of programming.

I thank  Dr. Charles Severance(Dr. Chuck). He is a great teacher and scientist. I never bore while listening to him. Excellent python course for beginners.
2019-01-25,Phillip D,5,0,"This course seemed course started a little slow covering the very basics of how computer hardware and software interact. However, I did learn a few things and look forward to taking more advanced programming courses with Coursera.  I really appreciate Coursera focuses on the ""why"" as much as the ""how""."
2017-02-25,Nate G,5,0,"Fairly phenomenal course. Goes at a pace extremely usable for someone who has never learned a programming language. The fact that the course is written for Python 2.7 instead of 3.0 makes it slightly outdated, but it is an easy fix once you get the hang of the syntax differences between the iterations.
"
2016-07-09,Gerlan d A C,5,0,"Wonderful training, really well put together by Dr. Chuck. His didactis is unbelievable! It makes learning not only much easier but really enjoyable! I´ll carry on into the learning track and I´m really thankful to Coursera and Dr. Chuck for this great opportunity! Cheers from Rio/Brazil. Gerlan Cidade"
2015-12-14,Jeremy C,5,0,"Programming makes sense to me now.
The course material is well thought out and progresses in a way that allows for full understanding of how the language works.  I have tried learning Python, C++, and Java from other sources; this is the first time I feel I have been successful.  I want't to learn more!"
2022-09-20,Matthew M,5,0,"W​hen I first enrolled in this course, I was initially worried about how complex things would be. Starting through the first week, I found myself learning a ton of things thanks to Professor Severance and his presentations. I definitely learned many things from the course and had so much fun doing so! "
2022-01-31,Anirudh K,5,0,I already know a few programming languages and started this course because I always wanted to learn Python. It's been really easy for me. But i see why he made it so easy. You seriously can become a Programmer even if you never coded in your life with this course. I wish i had this when i started out.
2021-03-13,Theo S P L,5,0,Uma vez que o curso não foi pago foi uma ótima introdução ao Python e tenho certeza que com os próximos cursos ganharei um bom entendimento da linguagem. O professor é muito alto-astral o que me deixou mais engajado com o tema. O curso é tido para ser feito em 7 semanas mas em 6-7 horas você finaliza.
2020-07-24,Prajakta C,5,0,"I loved this course. The instructor was so good at explaining concepts. I grasped everything immediately.

2020-06-18,TAMILSELVAN G,5,0,This is my first course in coursera. I never expect the teaching would be these much good. Thanks to the teacher. He's just mind blowingly fantasic. Also this is the best couse to startup with programming. Thank you coursera for such opportunity to learn such things. And also Thanks to the instructor.
2020-05-09,Mohd N S,5,0,"The course was very well structured. I've coded in several other languages but I think even a beginner would benefit and learn from this course. If I've any issues it's just the final assignment is an almost a sudden exponential level of difficulty compared to the previous ones, but I'd be nitpicking."
2019-08-04,Phil T,5,0,"I had a small experience of coding before this course, but found the structure very intuitive and the instructions clear. Prior to the course I didn't even know how (or where) to enter code on my Mac, I'm now able to write some simple code to execute a range of instructions. Really interesting course.  "
2017-11-03,Julia E,5,0,"Easy to follow, and I have no experience with coding whatsoever! Got rid of my fear of programming and looking forward to continue with the next courses. The lectures are perfectly paced and Dr. Severance is a briliant teacher. Also thanks for the staff who helped me when I got stuck in one of the ass"
2016-02-12,Alan T L,5,0,"I've taken a few introductory programming courses from different providers but i think this is the best one so far for people who are starting off. It lives up to the title ""Programming for Everybody"". Prof Severance makes it fun which I think is important in the beginning because programming is hard!"

More power to you Charles Sir and Coursera"
2021-12-03,Sanjib D,5,0,The lecturer is the most highlighted things is here. Everyone just think how to do the course but no one think how we help the student to better understand. But in this course the lecturer try every way to make the syllabus more funny with maximum understandable. That is the KEY POINT of this course. 
2020-12-31,Umutoni G,5,0,"The way this instructor teaches and explains everything makes it so much easier to learn and understand the logic behind every little thing in python. Honestly, I'd recommend anyone who wants to learn python to take this course in particular, especially if you have no prior experience in programming."

The course is paced optimally for beginners and the assignments are designed to help students practice and demonstrate what they have learned. I would prefer to have more assignments.  Dr. Chuck is systematic and clear in his explanations.
2018-10-20,Amber L,5,0,"If you have some programming under your belt, you should still take a moment to work through this first course. It will show you many of the intricate differences between Python and other languages you may know. Very well organized and even the textbook is a nice read! That's huge for a coding book!"
2018-03-22,Dhiman D,5,0,"This is an amazing course for ""beginners"". If you are totally new to programming world then this course is best for you. But if you are familiar with other programming language like C or Java then you may not find this course very useful. Take this course if you are totally new to programming world.
"
2018-01-07,Roger A,5,0,"Step by step approach. Always an element of stretch, but with perseverance you can work out the problems. Thankfully English is my first language, so at least that isn't an additional challenge. I have a greater appreciation for how much code goes into some relatively basic functions I use on my PC."
2021-10-07,Elisabeth A M,5,0,"V​ery easy to get into even if you have zero programming experience. Material is clear, and there's enough moments of dry wit and humor through the course and materials to keep you engaged.

The presentation is concise, so not overwhelmed with unnecessary information or overly long explanations.  The professor is engaging for the lectures."
2015-12-05,Victor,5,0,As an introductory course it offers a lot if you are aspiring to START learning about Python or programming in general. The workload is light but you learn enough and I'd recommend to advance to the course in the series to continue applying what you learned and to expand that knowledge more deeply.
2021-07-26,Elina M,5,0,"Programming has never been so fun! When combined with extra resources (books, trainings, extra course) this course becomes highly effective. It feels very natural to go from Matlab and Java to Python by doing solving these simple problems. Thanks a ton and I am looking forwards to the next course!"
2021-05-15,Juniper V,5,0,"The magical thing about you is that when you are talking about a teaching content, it feels like you are like us, and you don’t know what it is. Your unique guiding method is like a small upward fountain, and the hidden underneath is your huge reserves of knowledge.I will keep learning on Coursera"
2021-03-14,sumeyye d,5,0,"I had no idea before I joined the Dr.Charles Severance's course and now I feel like I passed the hardest part of the programming, cause I used to think always how I can start to and who can teach me from the begining. I am so glad to have that chance, thank you so much especially to Mr. Severance."
2020-11-08,Jessmae Z,5,0,This course is highly recommended! Title is very apt for the course: it is indeed programming for everybody.

I truly recommend this course to anyone living in the 20th century"
2019-12-26,Mark H,5,0,"My major concern before starting this was could I keep up with the workload while working a full time job. The combination of community forums in addition to lectures that allow you to pause, and take notes makes it very easy to keep up! I enjoyed the lecturer and courses use of modules. "
2019-05-26,Kingsly A,5,0,"Charles Severance teaches the python language from the scratch.

The professor is really entertaining and is great at teaching. I definitely recommend this to someone trying to get an introduction to programming."
2021-01-08,Wei J,5,0,"Very good. But, I think the assignment session should be more flexible. For example, in the last assignment, the answer is ""Maximum is 10"", my programme result is ""Maximum 10"", I lost ""is"". I checked my code hundreds of times lol.  Anyway, This is a very nice course for python beginner."
2020-09-17,Syed A,5,0,"This is the perfect course for someone who has never coded anything before. As someone who was already coming from a CS background even, I found it extremely helpful how the teacher takes their time to explain the most basic concepts so that a student may not be confused between syntax."
2020-06-19,Daniel A,5,0,"A well-curated course, eloquently designed to effectively teach anyone, it is particularly easy to grasp especially among students who have not had any experiencing programming before applying for the course.

2020-02-07,Pranith c K,5,0,"  Python is very beginner friendly. Its conciseness, expressiveness and likeliness to English contributes to its choice for rookies. Its readability complements this and also it is an interpreted language. Just have a look at this Python Syntaxtutorial and see it is to be a python person.  "
2018-09-28,Richard G H,5,0,"Great introduction that got me back into Python programming. I had previously learned to use Python in architecture school, but it had been too long for me to remember much. I'm glad I found this wonderful resource. You're a talented teacher, and I can't wait to take your other courses!"
2018-05-13,Myka T,5,0,"Instructor is very good. If you've got any experience in programming, going through the first class can be a bit tedious, but I found I was able to complete it very quickly with the C++ and Python I knew going into the class and was able to complete the class in a matter of a few hours."
2018-03-06,Ruixin G,5,0,Professor Severance is pretty good at explaining the concept and his lectures were not only clear but fun!

I highly recommend python for everybody."
2018-07-31,Yuzhuo F,5,0,The pace for every class was a little bit fast for real beginners and the instructor did not explain every details on the slides. Sometimes you need to find definitions and explanations for the content on your own. But overall a great class for beginners if you have time and patience. 
2018-06-26,John P B,5,0,"Great course. Even as a college instructor myself, I found the course entertaining and useful. Even from a pedagogical standpoint, I took away a few tricks, and also learned some of the nuances of Python that are substantially or sometimes just slightly different from other languages."
2016-06-06,Alastair B,5,0,A good introductory course.  Quite 'easy' but an excellent primer for what comes later.  Giving 5 stars as could run lectures at 1.5 speed / pause at appropriate times.
